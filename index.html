    <h3>Playlist Search Reinvented: LLMs Behind the Curtain (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tarun Sharma, Siddharth Sharma, Geetha Aluri, Joaquin Delgado</p>
    <p>Improving search functionality poses challenges such as data scarcity for model training, metadata enrichment for comprehensive document indexing, and the labor-intensive manual annotation for evaluation. Traditionally, iterative methods relying on human annotators and customer feedback have been used. However, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new solutions. This paper focuses on applying LLMs to playlist search in Amazon Music. Leveraging LLMs’ contextual understanding and generative capabilities automates metadata enrichment, reducing manual efforts and expediting training. LLMs also address data scarcity by generating synthetic training data and serve as scalable judges for evaluation, enhancing search performance assessment. We demonstrate how these innovations enhance playlist search, overcoming traditional limitations to improve search result accuracy and relevance.</p>

    <h3>Calibrating the Predictions for Top-N Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Sato</p>
    <p>Well-calibrated predictions of user preferences are essential for many applications. Since recommender systems typically select the top-N items for users, calibration for those top-N items, rather than for all items, is important.  We show that previous calibration methods result in miscalibrated predictions for the top-N items, despite their excellent calibration performance when evaluated on all items.  In this work, we address the miscalibration in the top-N recommended items. We first define evaluation metrics for this objective and then propose a generic method to optimize calibration models focusing on the top-N items. It groups the top-N items by their ranks and optimizes distinct calibration models for each group with rank-dependent training weights.  We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for both explicit and implicit feedback datasets, using diverse classes of recommender models.</p>

    <h3>Democratizing Urban Mobility Through an Open-Source, Multi-Criteria Route Recommendation System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Eggerth, Javier Argota Sánchez-Vaquerizo, Sachit Mahajan, Dirk Helbing</p>
    <p>Urban navigation systems traditionally optimize for efficiency, thereby overlooking environmental factors and personal preferences. This paper introduces Routify, a novel multi-criteria recommender system for personalized urban route selection. Routify advances the state-of-the-art in route recommendation through: (1) integration of diverse environmental data (air quality, noise levels, green spaces) with real-time IoT inputs; (2) a dynamic weighting algorithm allowing fine-grained user control over routing parameters; (3) transparent decision-making via an interactive interface displaying edge-level information; and (4) a community-driven feedback mechanism that continuously refines recommendations. We have implemented Routify as an open-source platform, facilitating further research and development. Experimental results from 1000 origin-destination pairs demonstrate significant improvements in user-defined environmental metrics (up to 32.98% increase in green index for walking and 16.91% reduction in noise levels for cycling) compared to traditional routing systems. These improvements come with slight trade-offs in distance, especially in walking mode. Our research contributes a comprehensive framework for multi-criteria route recommendation, balancing individual preferences, environmental factors, and community insights in urban navigation.</p>

    <h3>MMGCL: Meta Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-view Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wentao Zhang, Peng Jiang, Gaode Chen, Qi Zhang, Jingjian Lin, Changyu Li, Yuezihan Jiang, Peiyi Li, Fei Sun</p>
    <p>Multi-view Graph Learning is popular in recommendations due to its ability to capture relationships and connections across multiple views. Existing multi-view graph learning methods generally involve constructing graphs of views and performing information aggregation on view representations. Despite their effectiveness, they face two data limitations: Multi-focal Multi-source data noise and multi-source Data Sparsity. The former arises from the combination of noise from individual views and conflicting edges between views when information from all views is combined. The latter occurs because multi-view learning exacerbate the negative influence of data sparsity because these methods require more model parameters to learn more view information. Motivated by these issues, we propose MMGCL, a meta knowledge-enhanced multi-view graph contrastive learning framework for recommendations. To tackle the data noise issue, MMGCL extract meta knowledge to preserve important information from all views to form a meta view representation. It then rectifies every view in multi-learning frameworks, thus simultaneously removing the view-private noisy edges and conflicting edges across different views. To address the data sparsity issue, MMGCL performs meta knowledge transfer contrastive learning optimization on all views to reduce the searching space for model parameters and add more supervised signal. Besides, we have deployed MMGCL in a real industrial recommender system in China, and we further evaluate it on four benchmark datasets and a practical industry online application. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art recommendation performance of MMGCL.</p>

    <h3>One-class Matrix Factorization: Point-Wise Regression-Based or Pair-Wise Ranking-Based? (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Wei Chen, Chih-Jen Lin</p>
    <p>One-class matrix factorization (MF) is an important technique for recommender systems with implicit feedback. In one widely used setting, a regression function is fit in a point-wise manner on observed and some unobserved (user, item) entries. Recently, in AAAI 2019, Chen et al. [2] proposed a pair-wise ranking-based approach for observed (user, item) entries to be compared against unobserved ones. They concluded that the pair-wise setting performs consistently better than the more traditional point-wise setting. However, after some detailed investigation, we explain by mathematical derivations that their method may perform only similar to the point-wise ones. We also identified some problems when reproducing their experimental results. After considering suitable settings, we rigorously compare point-wise and pair-wise one-class MFs, and show that the pair-wise method is actually not better. Therefore, for one-class MF, the more traditional and mature point-wise setting should still be considered. Our findings contradict the conclusions in [2] and serve as a call for caution when researchers are comparing between two machine learning methods.</p>

    <h3>Putting Popularity Bias Mitigation to the Test: A User-Centric Evaluation in Music Recommenders (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Ungruh, Karlijn Dinnissen, Maria Soledad Pera, Hanna Hauptmann, Anja Volk</p>
    <p>Popularity bias is a prominent phenomenon in recommender systems (RS), especially in the music domain. Although popularity bias mitigation techniques are known to enhance the fairness of RS while maintaining their high performance, there is a lack of understanding regarding users’ actual perception of the suggested music. To address this gap, we conducted a user study (n=40) exploring user satisfaction and perception of personalized music recommendations generated by algorithms that explicitly mitigate popularity bias. Specifically, we investigate item-centered and user-centered bias mitigation techniques, aiming to ensure fairness for artists or users, respectively. Results show that neither mitigation technique harms the users’ satisfaction with the recommendation lists despite promoting underrepresented items. However, the item-centered mitigation technique impacts user perception; by promoting less popular items, it reduces users’ familiarity with the items. Lower familiarity evokes discovery—the feeling that the recommendations enrich the user’s taste. We demonstrate that this  can ultimately lead to higher satisfaction, highlighting the potential of less-popular recommendations to improve the user experience.</p>

    <h3>ReChorus2.0: A Modular and Task-Flexible Recommendation Library (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peijie Sun, Hanyu Li, Zhiyu He, Weizhi Ma, Shaoping Ma, Min Zhang, Jiayu Li</p>
    <p>With the applications of recommendation systems rapidly expanding, an increasing number of studies have focused on every aspect of recommender systems with different data inputs, models, and task settings. Therefore, a flexible library is needed to help researchers implement the experimental strategies they require. Existing open libraries for recommendation scenarios have enabled reproducing various recommendation methods and provided standard implementations. However, these libraries often impose certain restrictions on data and seldom support the same model to perform different tasks and input formats, limiting users from customized explorations. To fill the gap, we propose ReChorus2.0, a modular and task-flexible library for recommendation researchers. Based on ReChorus, we upgrade the supported input formats, models, and training\&evaluation strategies to help realize more recommendation tasks with more data types. The main contributions of ReChorus2.0 include:    (1) Realization of complex and practical tasks, including reranking and CTR prediction tasks;   (2) Inclusion of various context-aware and rerank recommenders;   (3) Extension of existing and new models to support different tasks with the same models;   (4) Support of highly-customized input with impression logs, negative items, or click labels, as well as user, item, and situation contexts.   To summarize, ReChorus2.0 serves as a comprehensive and flexible library better aligning with the practical problems in the recommendation scenario and catering to more diverse research needs.

    <h3>Self-Auxiliary Distillation for Sample Efficient Learning in Google-Scale Recommenders (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruoxi Wang, Tiansheng Yao, Ed H. Chi, Andrew Evdokimov, Yuan Gao, Jerry Zhang, Evan Ettinger, Derek Zhiyuan Cheng, Yin Zhang, Jonathan Valverde, Xiang Li</p>
    <p>Industrial recommendation systems process billions of daily user feedback which are complex and noisy. Efficiently uncovering user preference from these signals becomes crucial for high-quality recommendation. We argue that those signals are not inherently equal in terms of their informative value and training ability, which is particularly salient in industrial applications with multi-stage processes (e.g., augmentation, retrieval, ranking). Considering that, in this work, we propose a novel self-auxiliary distillation framework that prioritizes training on high-quality labels, and improves the resolution of low-quality labels through distillation by adding a bilateral branch-based auxiliary task. This approach enables flexible learning from diverse labels without additional computational costs, making it highly scalable and effective for Google-scale recommenders. Our framework consistently improved both offline and online key business metrics across three Google major products. Notably, self-auxiliary distillation proves to be highly effective in addressing the severe signal loss challenge posed by changes such as Apple iOS policy. It further delivered significant improvements in both offline (+17\% AUC) and online metrics for a Google Apps recommendation system. This highlights the opportunities of addressing real-world signal loss problems through self-auxiliary distillation techniques.</p>

    <h3>On Interpretability of Linear Autoencoders (2024)</h3>

    <p>We derive a novel graph-based interpretation of linear autoencoder models EASE, SLIM, and their approximate variants. Contrary to popular belief, we reveal that the weights of these models should not be interpreted as dichotomic item similarity but merely as its magnitude. Consequently, we propose a simple modification that considerably improves retrieval ability in sparse domains and yields interpretable inference with negative inputs, as demonstrated by our offline and online experiments.</p>

    <h3>Effective Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning in Contextual Combinatorial Bandits (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuta Saito, Tatsuhiro Shimizu, Ren Kishimoto, Masahiro Nomura, Koichi Tanaka, Haruka Kiyohara</p>
    <p>We explore off-policy evaluation and learning in contextual combinatorial bandits (CCB), where a policy selects a subset in the action space. For example, it might choose a set of furniture pieces (a bed and a drawer) from available items (bed, drawer, chair, etc.) for interior design sales. This setting is widespread in fields such as recommender systems and healthcare, yet OPE/L of CCB remains unexplored in the relevant literature. Standard OPE methods typically employ regression and importance sampling in the action subset space. However, they often face significant challenges due to high bias or variance, exacerbated by the exponential growth in the number of available subsets. To address these challenges, we introduce a concept of factored action space, which allows us to decompose each subset into binary indicators. These indicators signify whether each action is included in the selected subset. This formulation allows us to distinguish between the “main effect” derived from the main actions, and the “residual effect”, originating from the supplemental actions, facilitating more effective OPE. Specifically, our estimator, called OPCB, leverages an importance sampling-based approach to unbiasedly estimate the main effect, while employing regression-based approach to deal with the residual effect with low variance. OPCB achieves substantial variance reduction compared to conventional importance sampling methods and bias reduction relative to regression methods under certain conditions, as illustrated in our theoretical analysis. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate OPCB’s superior performance over the typical methods, particularly when navigating the complexities of a large action subset space.</p>

    <h3>CEERS: Counterfactual Evaluations of Explanations in Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikhail Baklanov</p>
    <p>The growing emphasis on explainability in ethical AI, driven by regulations like GDPR, underscores the need for robust explanations of Recommender Systems (RS). Key to the development and research progress of such methods are reproducible, quantifiable evaluation metrics. Traditional human-involved evaluation methods are not reproducible, subjective, costly, and fail to capture the counterfactual nuances of AI explanations. Hence, there is a pressing need for objective and scalable metrics to accurately measure the correctness of explanation methods for recommender systems. Inspired by similar approaches in computer vision, this research aims to propose a counterfactual approach to evaluate explanation accuracy in RS. While counterfactual evaluation methods have been established in other domains, they are underexplored in RS. Our goal is to introduce quantifiable metrics that objectively assess the correctness of local explanations. This approach enhances evaluation reliability and scalability, integrating various recommenders, explanation algorithms, and datasets. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive mechanism combining model fidelity with explanation correctness, advancing transparency and trustworthiness in AI-driven recommender systems.</p>

    <p>Recommendation systems play a crucial role in our daily lives, influencing many of our significant and minor decisions. These systems also have become integral to the music industry, guiding users to discover new content based on their tastes. However, the lack of transparency in these systems often leaves users questioning the rationale behind recommendations. To address this issue, adding transparency and explainability to recommender systems is a promising solution. Enhancing the explainability of these systems can significantly improve user trust and satisfaction. This research focuses on exploring transparency and explainability in the context of recommendation systems, focusing on the music domain. This research can help to understand the gaps in explainability in music recommender systems to create more engaging and trustworthy music recommendations.</p>

This emerging application aims to develop intelligent systems capable of proactively providing knowledge workers with the most relevant information based on their context to enhance productivity. In this paper, we explore this innovative application by first defining the scope of our study, outlining the key objectives, and introducing main challenges. We then present our current results and progress, including a comprehensive literature review, the proposal of a framework, the collection of a pioneering dataset, and the establishment of a benchmark for evaluating a recommendation scenario on our published dataset.

    <h3>Multi-Preview Recommendation via Reinforcement Learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuan-Ting Lai, Pengcheng Xiong, Zhong Wu, Yang Xu</p>
    <p>Preview recommendations serve as a crucial shortcut for attracting users’ attention on various systems, platforms, and webpages, significantly boosting user engagement. However, the variability of preview types and the flexibility of preview duration make it challenging to use an integrated framework for multi-preview recommendations under resource constraints. In this paper, we present an approach that incorporates constrained Q-learning into a notification recommendation system, effectively handling both multi-preview ranking and duration orchestration by targeting long-term user retention. Our method bridges the gap between combinatorial reinforcement learning, which often remains too theoretical for practical use, and segmented modules in production, where model performance is typically compromised due to over-simplification. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach through off-policy evaluation and online A/B testing using Microsoft data.</p>

    <h3>Explainable Multi-Stakeholder Job Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roan Schellingerhout</p>
    <p>Public opinion on recommender systems has become increasingly wary in recent years. In line with this trend, lawmakers have also started to become more critical of such systems, resulting in the introduction of new laws focusing on aspects such as privacy, fairness, and explainability for recommender systems and AI at large. These concepts are especially crucial in high-risk domains such as recruitment. In recruitment specifically, decisions carry substantial weight, as the outcomes can significantly impact individuals’ careers and companies’ success. Additionally, there is a need for a multi-stakeholder approach, as these systems are used by job seekers, recruiters, and companies simultaneously, each with its own requirements and expectations. In this paper, I summarize my current research on the topic of explainable, multi-stakeholder job recommender systems and set out a number of future research directions.</p>

    <h3>MAWI Rec: Leveraging Severe Weather Data in Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Surya Kallumadi, Julian Mcauley, Brendan Duncan</p>
    <p>Inferring user intent in recommender systems can help performance but is difficult because intent is personal and not directly observable. Previous work has leveraged signals to stand as a proxy for intent (e.g. user interactions with resource pages), but such signals are not always available. In this paper, we instead recognize that certain events, which are observable, directly influence user intent. For example, after a flood, home improvement customers are more likely to undertake a renovation project to dry out their basement. We introduce MAWI Rec, a recommender system that leverages severe weather data to improve recommendation.
