    <h3>Bootstrapping Conditional Retrieval for User-to-Item Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiajing Xu, Jaewon Yang, Hongtao Lin, Haoyu Chen</p>
    <p>User-to-item retrieval has been an active research area in recommendation system, and two tower models are widely adopted due to model simplicity and serving efficiency. In this work, we focus on a variant called conditional retrieval, where we expect retrieved items to be relevant to a condition (e.g. topic). We propose a method that uses the same training data as standard two tower models but incorporates item side information as conditions in query. This allows us to bootstrap new conditional retrieval use cases and encourages feature interactions between user and condition. Experiments show that our method can retrieve highly relevant items and out-performed standard two tower models with filters on engagement metrics. The proposed model is deployed to power a topic-based notification feed at Pinterest and led to +0.26% weekly active users.</p>

    <h3>Generative Learning Plan Recommendation for Employees: A Performance-aware Reinforcement Learning Approach (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying Sun, Xin Song, Hengshu Zhu, Hui Xiong, Zhi Zheng</p>
    <p>With the rapid development of enterprise Learning Management Systems (LMS), more and more companies are trying to build enterprise training and course learning platforms for promoting the career development of employees. Indeed, through course learning, many employees have the opportunity to improve their knowledge and skills. For these systems, a major issue is how to recommend learning plans, i.e., a set of courses arranged in the order they should be learned, that can help employees improve their work performance. Existing studies mainly focus on recommending courses that users are most likely to click on by capturing their learning preferences. However, the learning preference of employees may not be the right fit for their career development, and thus it may not necessarily mean their work performance can be improved accordingly. Furthermore, how to capture the mutual correlation and sequential effects between courses, and ensure the rationality of the generated results, is also a major challenge. To this end, in this paper, we propose the Generative Learning plAn recommenDation (GLAD) framework, which can generate personalized learning plans for employees to help them improve their work performance. Specifically, we first design a performance predictor and a rationality discriminator, which have the same transformer-based model architecture, but with totally different parameters and functionalities. In particular, the performance predictor is trained for predicting the work performance of employees based on their work profiles and historical learning records, while the rationality discriminator aims to evaluate the rationality of the generated results. Then, we design a learning plan generator based on the gated transformer and the cross-attention mechanism for learning plan generation. We calculate the weighted sum of the output from the performance predictor and the rationality discriminator as the reward, and we use Self-Critical Sequence Training (SCST) based policy gradient methods to train the generator following the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) paradigm. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world data clearly validate the effectiveness of our GLAD framework compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods and reveal some interesting findings for talent management</p>

    <h3>An Exploration of Sentence-Pair Classification for Algorithmic Recruiting (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toine Bogers, Mesut Kaya</p>
    <p>Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the application of computational approaches to different HR tasks, such as algorithmic hiring, skill extraction, and monitoring of employee satisfaction. Much of the recent work on estimating the fit between a person and a job has used representation learning to represent both resumes and job vacancies computationally and determine the degree to which they match. A common approach to this task is Sentence-BERT, which uses a Siamese network to encode resumes and job descriptions into fixed-length vectors and estimates how well they match based on the similarity between those vectors. In our paper, we adapt BERT’s next-sentence prediction task—predicting whether one sentence is likely to follow another in a given context—to the task of matching resumes with job descriptions. Using historical data on past (mis)matches between job-resume pairs, we fine-tune BERT for this downstream task. Through a combination of offline and online experiments on data from a large Scandinavian job portal, we show that this approach performs significantly better than Sentence-BERT and other state-of-the-art approaches for determining person-job fit.</p>

    <h3>Explainable Recommendations via Attentive Multi-Persona Collaborative Filtering (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avi Caciularu, Oren Barkan, Noam Koenigstein, Yonatan Fuchs</p>
    <p>Two main challenges in recommender systems are modeling users with heterogeneous taste, and providing explainable recommendations. In this paper, we propose the neural Attentive Multi-Persona Collaborative Filtering (AMP-CF) model as a unified solution for both problems. AMP-CF breaks down the user to several latent ‘personas’ (profiles) that identify and discern the different tastes and inclinations of the user. Then, the revealed personas are used to generate and explain the final recommendation list for the user. AMP-CF models users as an attentive mixture of personas, enabling a dynamic user representation that changes based on the item under consideration. We demonstrate AMP-CF on five collaborative filtering datasets from the domains of movies, music, video games and social networks. As an additional contribution, we propose a novel evaluation scheme for comparing the different items in a recommendation list based on the distance from the underlying distribution of “tastes” in the user’s historical items. Experimental results show that AMP-CF is competitive with other state-of-the-art models. Finally, we provide qualitative results to showcase the ability of AMP-CF to explain its recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Auto-Surprise: An Automated Recommender-System (AutoRecSys) Library with Tree of Parzens Estimator (TPE) Optimization (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohan Anand, Joeran Beel</p>
    <p>We introduce Auto-Surprise1, an automated recommender system library. Auto-Surprise is an extension of the Surprise recommender system library and eases the algorithm selection and configuration process. Compared to an out-of-the-box Surprise library, without hyper parameter optimization, AutoSurprise performs better, when evaluated with MovieLens, Book Crossing and Jester datasets. It may also result in the selection of an algorithm with significantly lower runtime. Compared to Surprise’s grid search, Auto-Surprise performs equally well or slightly better in terms of RMSE, and is notably faster in finding the optimum hyperparameters.</p>

    <h3>MultiRec: A Multi-Relational Approach for Unique Item Recommendation in Auction Systems (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lars Schmidt-Thieme, Andre Hintsches, Shayan Jawed, Ahmed Rashed</p>
    <p>In auction-based systems such as in used car centers and online auction websites, users usually bid on items, and those items get sold to their highest bidders. In these settings, every item is unique and can be sold only once, which means users’ purchase histories will be unique, and no common items will exist across them. On the other hand, items will not have any historical sales at all. Such extreme settings pose a significant challenge to the current recommender systems models that rely on historical user-item interactions. While some of those models will not be applicable altogether, such as the matrix factorization models, neighborhood models, and even the naive most-popular model, the rest will need to rely only on items’ attributes. In this paper, we address the challenges of auction-based item recommendation by proposing a simple multi-relational recommender model (MultiRec) that can seamlessly leverage user and item attributes along with auxiliary relational information such as the user’s bidding history. Experiments on one proprietary dataset from Volkswagen Financial Services used-cars center, and on a real-world publicly available eBay dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms multiple state-of-art models in the task of auction-based unique item recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Preference Elicitation as an Optimization Problem (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filip Radlinski, Maarten de Rijke, Julia Kiseleva, Anna Sepliarskaia</p>
    <p>The new user cold-start problem arises when a recommender system does not yet have any information about a user. A common solution to this problem is to generate a user profile as part of the sign-up process, by asking the user to rate several items. We propose a new elicitation method to generate a static preference questionnaire (SPQ) that asks a new user to make pairwise comparisons between items by posing relative preference questions. Using a latent factor model, SPQ improves personalized recommendations by choosing a minimal and diverse set of static preference questions to ask any new user. We are the first to rigorously prove which optimization task should be solved in order to select the next preference question for static questionnaires. Our theoretical results are confirmed by extensive experimentation. We test the performance of SPQ on two real-world datasets, under two experimental conditions: simulated, when users behave according to LFM, and real, in which there is no user rating model. SPQ reduces the questionnaire length that is necessary to make accurate recommendations for new users by up to a factor of three compared to state-of-the-art preference elicitation methods. Moreover, solving the right optimization task, SPQ shows better performance than baselines with dynamically generated questions.</p>

    <h3>Learning Consumer and Producer Embeddings for User-Generated Content Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian McAuley, Wang-Cheng Kang</p>
    <p>User-Generated Content (UGC) is at the core of web applications where users can both produce and consume content. This differs from traditional e-Commerce domains where content producers and consumers are usually from two separate groups. In this work, we propose a method CPRec (consumer and producer based recommendation), for recommending content on UGC-based platforms. Specifically, we learn a core embedding for each user and two transformation matrices to project the user’s core embedding into two ‘role’ embeddings (i.e., a producer and consumer role). We model each interaction by the ternary relation between the consumer, the consumed item, and its producer. Empirical studies on two large-scale UGC applications show that our method outperforms standard collaborative filtering methods as well as recent methods that model producer information via item features.</p>

    <h3>Music Playlist Recommendation via Preference Embedding (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chih-Chun Hsia, Ming-Feng Tsai, Yian Chen, Chih-Ming Chen, Chun-Yao Yang</p>
    <p>Music playlists usually contain some particular musical styles or atmospheres in which users would like to be involved. Music streaming services, such as Spotify, Apple Music, and KKBOX, even allow users to edit and listen to playlists online. While it has been some well-known methods that can nicely model the preference between users and songs, little has been done in the literature to recommend music playlists, each of which can be considered as a set of many individual songs, to users. In the light of this, this paper proposes a preference embedding based on a user-song-playlist graph to learn the preference representations of these three entities. After the embedding process, we then use the learned representations to perform the task of playlist recommendation. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset show that the proposed embedding method outperforms the baseline of popularity; in addition, we also make a comparison with DeepWalk and LINE for the recommendation task, and the results show that the proposed method can stand comparison with the two state-of-the-art graph embedding techniques.</p>

    <h3>Automating Readers’ Advisory to Make Book Recommendations for K-12 Readers (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Pera, Yiu-Kai Ng</p>
    <p>The academic performance of students is affected by their reading ability, which explains why reading is one of the most important aspects of school curriculums. Promot- ing good reading habits among K-12 students is essential, given the enormous influence of reading on students’ de- velopment as learners and members of society. In doing so, it is indispensable to provide readers with engaging and motivating reading selections. Unfortunately, existing book recommenders have failed to offer adequate choices for K- 12 readers, since they either ignore the reading abilities of their users or cannot acquire the much-needed information to make recommendations due to privacy issues. To address these problems, we have developed Rabbit, a book recom- mender that emulates the readers’ advisory service offered at school/public libraries. Rabbit considers the readability levels of its readers and determines the facets, i.e., appeal factors, of books that evoke subconscious, emotional reac- tions on a reader. The design of Rabbit is unique, since it adopts a multi-dimensional approach to capture the reading abilities, preferences, and interests of its readers, which goes beyond the traditional book content/topical analysis. Con- ducted empirical studies have shown that Rabbit outper- forms a number of (readability-based) book recommenders.</p>
