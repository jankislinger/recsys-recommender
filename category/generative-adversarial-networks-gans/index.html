    <h3>Discerning Canonical User Representation for Cross-Domain Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sherry Sahebi, Siqian Zhao</p>
    <p>Cross-domain recommender systems have emerged, to address the cold-start problem and enhance recommendation outcomes by leveraging information transfer across different domains. Existing cross-domain recommender systems have investigated the learning of both domain-specific and domain-shared user preferences to enhance recommendation performance. However, these models typically allow the disparities between shared and distinct user preferences to emerge freely in any space, lacking sufficient constraints to identify differences between two domains and ensure that both domains are considered simultaneously. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) has shown promise for transferring information between domains, by mapping their user representations into the same space. But, CCA only models domain similarities, and fails to capture the potential differences between user preferences in different domains. In this paper, we propose Discerning Canonical User Representation Learning for Cross-Domain Recommendation (DICUCDR), a generative adversarial networks (GAN) based method that learns both domain-shared and domain-specific user representations. DICUCDR introduces Discerning Canonical Correlation User Representation Learning (DCCRL), a novel design of non-linear Canonical Correlation mappings that creates a shared transformation for simultaneously mapping similarities between different domains and separating domain differences from domains. We compare DICUCDR against several state-of-the-art approaches using two real-world datasets. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of separately learning shared and specific user representations via DCCRL.</p>

    <h3>RecGAN: Recurrent Generative Adversarial Networks for Recommendation Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Homin Park, Homanga Bharadhwaj, Brian Y. Lim</p>
    <p>Recent studies in recommendation systems emphasize the significance of modeling latent features behind temporal evolution of user preference and item state to make relevant suggestions. However, static and dynamic behaviors and trends of users and items, which highly influence the feasibility of recommendations, were not adequately addressed in previous works. In this work, we leverage the temporal and latent feature modelling capabilities of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), respectively, to propose a Recurrent Generative Adversarial Network (RecGAN). We use customized Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells to capture latent features of users and items observable from short-term and long-term temporal profiles. The modification also includes collaborative filtering mechanisms to improve the relevance of recommended items. To evaluated RecGAN using two datasets on food and movie recommendation. Results indicate that our model outperforms other baseline models irrespective of user behavior and density of training data.</p>
