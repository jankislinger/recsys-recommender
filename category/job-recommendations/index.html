    <h3>Explainable Multi-Stakeholder Job Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roan Schellingerhout</p>
    <p>Public opinion on recommender systems has become increasingly wary in recent years. In line with this trend, lawmakers have also started to become more critical of such systems, resulting in the introduction of new laws focusing on aspects such as privacy, fairness, and explainability for recommender systems and AI at large. These concepts are especially crucial in high-risk domains such as recruitment. In recruitment specifically, decisions carry substantial weight, as the outcomes can significantly impact individuals’ careers and companies’ success. Additionally, there is a need for a multi-stakeholder approach, as these systems are used by job seekers, recruiters, and companies simultaneously, each with its own requirements and expectations. In this paper, I summarize my current research on the topic of explainable, multi-stakeholder job recommender systems and set out a number of future research directions.</p>

    <h3>Leveraging LLM generated labels to reduce bad matches in job recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dheeraj Toshniwal, Yingchi Pei, Yi Wei Pang, Nilanjan Sengupta</p>
    <p>Negative signals are increasingly employed to enhance recommendation quality. However, explicit negative feedback is often sparse and may disproportionately reflect the preferences of more vocal users. Commonly used implicit negative feedback, such as impressions without positive interactions, has the limitation of not accurately capturing users’ true negative preferences because users mainly pursue information they consider interesting. In this work, we present an approach that leverages fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate matches and generate negative signals at scale while maintaining cost efficiency. We demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation quality by deploying a traditional classifier trained using LLM-generated labels.</p>

    <h3>Should we Embed? A Study on the Online Performance of Utilizing Embeddings for Real-Time Job Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elisabeth Lex, Emanuel Lacic, Valentin Slawicek, Markus Reiter-Haas, Tomislav Duricic</p>
    <p>In this work, we present the findings of an online study, where we explore the impact of utilizing embeddings to recommend job postings under real-time constraints. On the Austrian job platform Studo Jobs, we evaluate two popular recommendation scenarios: (i) providing similar jobs and, (ii) personalizing the job postings that are shown on the homepage. Our results show that for recommending similar jobs, we achieve the best online performance in terms of Click-Through Rate when we employ embeddings based on the most recent interaction. To personalize the job postings shown on a user’s homepage, however, combining embeddings based on the frequency and recency with which a user interacts with job postings results in the best online performance. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Predicting Online Performance of Job Recommender Systems With Offline Evaluation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrien Mogenet, Tuan Anh Nguyen Pham, Masahiro Kazama, Jialin Kong</p>
    <p>Recommender systems can be used to recommend jobs. In this context, implicit and explicit feedback signals we can collect are rare events, making the task of evaluation more complex. Online evaluation (A-B testing) is usually the most reliable way to measure the results from our experiments, but it is a slow process. In contrast, the offline evaluation process is faster, but it is critical to make it reliable as it informs our decision to roll out new improvements in production. In this paper, we review the comparative offline and online performances of three recommendations models, we describe the evaluation metrics we use and analyze how the offline performance metrics correlate with online metrics to understand how an offline evaluation process can be leveraged to inform the decisions. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Explaining and Exploring Job Recommendations: a User-driven Approach for Interacting with Knowledge-based Job Recommender Systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nyi Nyi Htun, Gerd Goetschalckx, Robin De Croon, Katrien Verbert, Francisco Gutiérrez, Sven Charleer</p>
    <p>The dynamics of the labor market and the tasks with which jobs are being composed are continuously evolving. Job mobility is not evident, and providing effective recommendations in this context has also been found to be particularly challenging. In this paper, we present Labor Market Explorer, an interactive dashboard that enables job seekers to explore the labor market in a personalized way based on their skills and competences. Through a user-centered design process involving job seekers and job mediators, we developed this dashboard to enable job seekers to explore job recommendations and their required competencies, as well as how these competencies map to their profile. Evaluation results indicate the dashboard empowers job seekers to explore, understand, and find relevant vacancies, mostly independent of their background and age.</p>
