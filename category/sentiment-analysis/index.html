    <h3>Towards Empathetic Conversational Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingfei Liang, Yougang Lyu, Zhaochun Ren, Zhanhui Kang, Pengjie Ren, Xin Xin, Xiaoyu Zhang, Bo Zhang, Maarten de Rijke, Ruobing Xie</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) are able to elicit user preferences through multi-turn dialogues. They typically incorporate external knowledge and pre-trained language models to capture the dialogue context. Most CRS approaches, trained on benchmark datasets, assume that the standard items and responses in these benchmarks are optimal. However, they overlook that users may express negative emotions with the standard items and may not feel emotionally engaged by the standard responses. This issue leads to a tendency to replicate the logic of recommenders in the dataset instead of aligning with user needs. To remedy this misalignment, we introduce empathy within a CRS. With empathy we refer to a system’s ability to capture and express emotions. We propose an empathetic conversational recommender (ECR) framework. ECR contains two main modules: emotion-aware item recommendation and emotion-aligned response generation. Specifically, we employ user emotions to refine user preference modeling for accurate recommendations. To generate human-like emotional responses, ECR applies retrieval-augmented prompts to fine-tune a pre-trained language model aligning with emotions and mitigating hallucination. To address the challenge of insufficient supervision labels, we enlarge our empathetic data using emotion labels annotated by large language models and emotional reviews collected from external resources. We propose novel evaluation metrics to capture user satisfaction in real-world CRS scenarios. Our experiments on the ReDial dataset validate the efficacy of our framework in enhancing recommendation accuracy and improving user satisfaction.</p>

    <h3>Combining Text Summarization and Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis of Users’ Reviews to Justify Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Lops, Giovanni Semeraro, Marco de Gemmis, Cataldo Musto, Gaetano Rossiello</p>
    <p>In this paper we present a methodology to justify recommendations that relies on the information extracted from users’ reviews discussing the available items. The intuition behind the approach is to conceive the justification as a summary of the most relevant and distinguishing aspects ofthe item, automatically obtained by analyzing the available reviews. To this end, we designed a pipeline of natural language processing techniques based on aspect extraction, sentiment analysis and text summarization to gather the reviews, process the relevant excerpts,and generate a unique synthesis presenting the main characteristics of the item. Such a summary is finally presented to the target user as justification of the recommendation she received. In the experimental evaluation we carried out a user study in the movie domain (N=141) and the results showed that our approach is able to make the recommendation process more transparent, engaging and trustful for the users. Moreover, the proposed method also beat another review-based explanation technique, thus confirming the validity of our intuition. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>A Multi-criteria Recommender System Exploiting Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis of Users’ Reviews (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco De Gemmis, Giovanni Semeraro, Cataldo Musto, Pasquale Lops</p>
    <p>In this paper we propose a multi-criteria recommender system based on collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, which exploits the information conveyed by users’ reviews to provide a multi-faceted representation of users’ interests. To this end, we exploited a framework for opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which automatically extracts relevant aspects and sentiment scores from users’ reviews. As an example, in a restaurant recommendation scenario, the aspects may regard food quality, service, position, atmosphere of the place and so on. Such a multi-faceted representation of the user is used to feed a multi-criteria CF algorithm which predicts user interest in a particular item and provides her with recommendations. In the experimental session we evaluated the performance of the algorithm against several state-of-the-art baselines; Results confirmed the insight behind this work, since our approach was able to overcome both single-criteria recommendation algorithms as well as more sophisticated techniques based on matrix factorization.</p>

    <h3>Music Emotion Recognition via End-to-End Multimodal Neural Networks (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byungsoo Jeon, Jungwoo Ha, Adrian Kim, Jangyeon Park, Dongwon Kim, Chanju Kim</p>
    <p>Music emotion recognition (MER) is a key issue in user context-aware recommendation. Many existing methods require hand-crafted features on audio and lyrics. Here we propose a new end-to-end method for recognizing emotions of tracks from their acoustic signals and lyrics via multimodal deep neural networks. We evaluate our method on about 7,000 K-pop tracks labeled as positive or negative emotion. The proposed method is compared to end-to-end unimodal models using audio signals or lyrics only. The experimental results show that our multimodal model achieves the best accuracy as 80%, and we discuss the reasons of these results.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation of High Quality Representative Reviews in e-commerce (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chetan Kalyan, Sudeshna Sarkar, Muthusamy Chelliah, Debanjan Paul, Prajit Prashant Sinai Nadkarni</p>
    <p>Users of ecommerce portals commonly use customer reviews for making purchase decisions. Many products contain tens or hundreds of reviews which makes it impossible for the customer to read all of them in order to get a good idea about the product. A review recommendation system that can recommend a subset of the reviews is thus useful for e-commerce websites. However customer reviews are of varied quality and different reviews cover different aspects or issues about the product. We follow previous work that maintain the statistical distribution of product aspects along with their associated sentiments of the entire review set for that particular product. However we address the challenge which arises due to the fact that similar aspects are mentioned in different reviews using different natural language expressions (e.g. camera, photo and picture refers to the same product aspect of camera). We use vector representations to identify mentions of similar aspects and group them together under single product aspect. Review helpfulness score may act as a proxy for quality of reviews, but this approach suffers from cold start problem as new reviews do not have any helpfulness score. We measure the quality of the review based on its content by doing supervised training using a convolutional neural network. Though  our neural network model is trained with reviews from Amazon dataset which have helpfulness score, our model can be used to predict the quality score of new reviews which do not have any helpfulness score. The recommended subset of reviews have high content score and the coverage of the product aspects, issues and sentiments are representative of the entire review set. The system is evaluated on datasets from Amazon and is found to be more useful than the competing methods.</p>

    <h3>Interpretable Convolutional Neural Networks with Dual Local and Global Attention for Review Rating Prediction (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing Huang, Sungyong Seo, Hao Yang, Yan Liu</p>
    <p>Recently, many e-commerce websites have encouraged their users to rate shopping items and write review text. This review text information has been very useful for understanding user preferences and item properties and it enhances the capability to make personalized recommendations of these websites. In this paper, we propose to model user preferences and item properties using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with dual local and global attention, motivated by the superiority of CNNs to extract complex features. By using aggregated review text from a user and aggregated review text for an item, our model can learn the unique features (embedding) of each user and each item. These features are then used to predict ratings. We train these user and item networks jointly and this enables the interaction between users and items in a similar way to matrix factorization. The local attention gives us insight on a user’s preferences or an item’s properties. The global attention helps CNNs focus on semantic meanings of the whole review text. Thus, the combined local and global attentions enable an interpretable and better-learned representation of users and items. We validate the proposed models by applying popular review datasets in Yelp and Amazon and compare the results with matrix factorization (MF), the hidden factors as topics (HFT) model, and the recently proposed convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF+). The proposed CNNs with dual attention model outperforms HFT and ConvMF+ in terms of mean square errors (MSE). In addition, we compare the user/item embeddings learned from these models for classification and recommendation. These results also confirm the superior quality of user/item embeddings learned from our model.</p>

    <h3>Analysis of User-generated Content for Improving YouTube Video Recommendation (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabio Gasparetti, Davide Feltoni Gurini, Alessandro Micarelli, Giuseppe Sansonetti, Michele Galli</p>
    <p>Everyday video-sharing websites such as YouTube collect large amounts of new multimedia resources. Comments left by viewers often provide valuable information to describe sentiments, opinions and tastes of users. For this reason, we propose a novel re-ranking approach that takes into consideration that information in order to provide better recommendations of related videos. Early experiments indicate an improvement in the recommendation performance.</p>

    <h3>Aspect-Based Opinion Mining and Recommendation System for Restaurant Reviews (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Magdalini Eirinaki, Syeda Roohi, Vaishak Suresh</p>
    <p>The success of a product/service in e-commerce largely depends on the user reviews. A product/service that has a higher average review or rating usually gets picked against a similar product/service with less favorable reviews. Reviews usually have an overall rating, but most of the times there are sub-texts in the review body that describe certain features/aspects of the product. This demonstration presents a system that extracts aspect-specific ratings from reviews and also recommends reviews to users based on their and other users' rating patterns.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Sentiment Homophily for Link Prediction (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Munindar Singh, Pradeep Murukannaiah, Guangchao Yuan, Zhe Zhang</p>
    <p>Link prediction system has been extensively studied and adopted to recommendation systems on social media. With the increasing popularity of sentiment analysis on social network, knowing the relationship between users’ sentiments and link prediction is important. In this paper, we study how to exploit sentiment homophily in link prediction. We have gathered political campaign dataset of one-month on Twitter. We define a set of sentiment-based features that quantify the likelihood of two users becoming friends based on their sentiments toward topics. Our evaluation in a supervised learning framework demonstrates the benefits of sentiment-based features in link prediction. Further, Adamic-Adar and Euclidean distance based measures are the best predictors. We propose a factor graph model that incorporates the sentiment-based cognitive balance theory. Our evaluation shows how our model offers help in link prediction on different kinds of graphs, compared to traditional machine learning techniques. Our work offers new insights for real-world link recommendation systems.</p>
