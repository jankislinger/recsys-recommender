    <h3>TLRec: A Transfer Learning Framework to Enhance Large Language Models for Sequential Recommendation Tasks (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuang Peng, Jiaye Lin, Zhong Zhang, Peilin Zhao</p>
    <p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in recommendation systems, improving recommendation performance through in-context learning or parameter-efficient fine-tuning. However, cross-domain generalization, i.e., model training in one scenario (source domain) but inference in another (target domain), is underexplored. In this paper, we present TLRec, a transfer learning framework aimed at enhancing LLMs for sequential recommendation tasks. TLRec specifically focuses on text inputs to mitigate the challenge of limited transferability across diverse domains, offering promising advantages over traditional recommendation models that heavily depend on unique identities (IDs) like user IDs and item IDs. Moreover, we leverage the source domain data to further enhance LLMs’ performance in the target domain. Initially, we employ powerful closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) and chain-of-thought techniques to construct instruction tuning data from the third-party scenario (source domain). Subsequently, we apply curriculum learning to fine-tune LLMs for effective knowledge injection and perform recommendations in the target domain. Experimental results demonstrate that TLRec achieves superior performance under the zero-shot and few-shot settings.</p>

    <h3>Instructing and Prompting Large Language Models for Explainable Cross-domain Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Petruzzelli, Cataldo Musto, Pasquale Lops, Marco de Gemmis, Ivan Rinaldi, Giovanni Semeraro, Lucrezia Laraspata</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present a strategy to provide users with explainable cross-domain recommendations (CDR) that exploits large language models (LLMs). Generally speaking, cross-domain recommender systems typically suffer of data sparsity issues, since they require a large amount of data labeled in both base and target domains, which are not easy to collect. Accordingly, our approach relies on the intuition that the knowledge that is already encoded in LLMs can be used to bridge the domains and seamlessly provide users with personalized cross-domain suggestions. To this end, we designed a pipeline to: (a) instruct a LLM to handle a CDR task; (b) design a personalized prompt, based on the preferences of the user in a base domain, in both zero-shot and one-shot settings; (c) feed the LLM with the prompt, and process the answer in order to extract the recommendations in a target domain, together with a natural language explanation supporting the suggestion. As shown in the experimental evaluation, our approach beats several established state-of-the-art baselines for CDR in most of the experimental settings, thus showing the effectiveness of LLMs also in this novel and scarcely investigated scenario.</p>

    <h3>Large Language Models are Competitive Near Cold-start Recommenders for Language- and Item-based Preferences (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Dixon, Krisztian Balog, Filip Radlinski, Scott Sanner, Ben Wedin</p>
    <p>Traditional recommender systems leverage users’ item preference history to recommend novel content that users may like.  However, dialog interfaces that allow users to express language-based preferences offer a fundamentally different modality for preference input.  Inspired by recent successes of prompting paradigms for large language models (LLMs), we study their use for making recommendations from both item-based and language-based preferences in comparison to state-of-the-art item-based collaborative filtering (CF) methods.  To support this investigation, we collect a new dataset consisting of both item-based and language-based preferences elicited from users along with their ratings on a variety of (biased) recommended items and (unbiased) random items.  Among numerous experimental results, we find that LLMs provide competitive recommendation performance for pure language-based preferences (no item preferences) in the near cold-start case in comparison to item-based CF methods, despite having no supervised training for this specific task (zero-shot) or only a few labels (few-shot).  This is particularly promising as language-based preference representations are more explainable and scrutable than item-based or vector-based representations.</p>

    <h3>Visual Representation for Capturing Creator Theme in Brand-Creator Marketplace (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keren Gaiger, Shaked Zychlinski, Ravid Cohen, Sarel Duanis, Asnat Greenstein-Messica</p>
    <p>Providing cold start recommendations in a brand-creator marketplace is challenging as brands’ preferences extend beyond the mere objects depicted in the creator’s content and encompass the creator’s individual theme consistently resonates across images shared on her social media profile. Furthermore, brands often use textual keywords to describe their campaign’s aesthetic appeal, with which creators must align. To address these challenges, we propose two methods: SAME (Same Account Media Embedding), a novel creator representation employing a Siamese network to capture the unique creator theme and OAAR (Object-Agnostic Adjective Representation), enabling filtering creators based on textual adjectives that relate to aesthetic qualities through zero-shot learning. These two methods utilize CLIP, a state-of-the-art language-image model, and improve it in addressing the aforementioned challenges.</p>
