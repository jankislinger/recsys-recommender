    <h3>TourRec — A Tourist Trip Recommender System for Individuals and Groups (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Laß, Daniel Herzog, Wolfgang Wörndl</p>
    <p>In this demo paper, we present TourRec, amobile Recommender System (RS) for tourist trips, sequences of points of interest (POIs) along enjoyable routes. The core of TourRec is a modular, multi-tier architecture facilitating the development and evaluation of new recommendation algorithms, clients and data sources. We show how the TourRec Android application can be used to recommend tourist trips to individuals and groups. Furthermore, we explain how TourRec supports the evaluation of different recommendation algorithms and group recommendation strategies. A video demonstrating how TourRec works is available under https://youtu.be/o_yx8UGvvvo.</p>

    <h3>Health-aware Food Recommender System (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Massimo, Mouzhi Ge, Francesco Ricci</p>
    <p>With the rapid changes in the food variety and lifestyles, many people are facing the problem of making healthier food decisions to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. To this end, our recommender system not only offers recipe recommendations that suit the user’s preference but is also able to take the user’s health into account. It is developed on a mobile platform by considering that our application may be directly used in the kitchen. This demo paper summarizes the complete human-computer interaction design, the implemented health-aware recommendation algorithm and preliminary user feedback.</p>

    <h3>Long Term Recommender Benchmarking for Mobile Shopping List Applications using Markov Chains (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thorben Keller, Sandro Schopfer</p>
    <p>This paper presents a method to estimate the performance and success rate of a recommender system for digital shopping lists. The list contains a number of items that are allowed to occupy three dierent states ( to be purchased, purchased and deleted) as a function of time. Using Markov chains, the probability distribution function over time can be estimated for each state, and thus, the probability that a recommendation is deleted from the list can be used to benchmark a recommender on its endurance and performance. An experimental set up is described that allows to test the presented method in an actual mobile application. The application of the method will allow to benchmark a variety of recommenders. An outlook is given on how the presented method can be used iteratively to support a recommender in nding the user’s favourite items/products.</p>

    <h3>Cosibon: An e-Commerce Like Platform Enabling Bricks-and-Mortar Stores to Use Sophisticated Product Recommender Systems (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthias Raffelsieper, Thorben Keller</p>
    <p>Compared to online-retailers, bricks-and-mortar stores have only limited possibilities to understand consumer preferences, their intentions, and their feedback. The first are able to evaluate clickstream data collected on their webpages alongside the actual purchase data to put together a comprehensive view on individual customers. Bricks-and-mortar stores on the other hand have to rely solely on the evaluation of scanner data collected at the point of sale. Thus, akin to the Event Horizon in physics, describing the boundary beyond which events are unobservable, we introduce the term Receipt Horizon to describe the natural boundary beyond which a retailing company is unable to observe the behavior of individual customers. In this demo paper we present our comprehensive approach on how bricks-and-mortar stores can go beyond the Receipt Horizon. We demonstrate how existing customer loyalty programs can be leveraged by an extensive mobile app, transferring proven ecommerce concepts to physical retailers and collecting numerous novel information about consumers.</p>

    <h3>Focal: A Personalized Mobile News Reader (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frederik Galle, Boi Faltings, Florent Garcin</p>
    <p>Traditionally in mobile apps, news articles and recommendations are presented to the users as an ordered list. This ordering often reflects the freshness of the stories. Although most users are satisfied with such presentation, some users have different expectations and want to read stories related to some specific topics. In this demo, we depart from the classic list-view layout and aim at exploring other ways to present news stories to the users. We introduce Focal, a personalized mobile news reader, which implements a fisheye-inspired interface. We briefly describe its system architecture and interface.</p>

    <h3>Tell Me Where to Go and What to Do Next, but Do Not Bother Me (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Liu, Gang Wu</p>
    <p>In this demonstration, we present a system that recommends to the user the locations and activities she/he might be interested in according to history GPS trajectories and public places of interest (POI) data. Its innovation lies in the acceptable performance of recommendations in cases where no user comments on activity types are available. Such situations are more realistic considering the restrictions on mobile devices' abilities, users' privacies, or business secret. For this purpose, we first extract stay points according to uses' trajectories, and label them with the top-k common activities which have the most possibility in terms of the POI dataset. Then, by taking stay points as observations, and activities as hidden states, a Hidden Markov model is built to learn the transfer possibilities between activities and the generation probabilities between activities and stay points. Finally, with the obtained model, our system can perform two types of recommendation, i.e. the history based recommendation and the similarity based recommendation. The results of former type are those stay points from user's own history positions. While, the latter one conducts collaborative filtering by taking history based recommendation results from similar users. The demonstration shows the running effects of the implemented prototype system, in which the Microsoft GeoLife trajectories dataset and the "DianPing.com" POI dataset were loaded. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate the feasibility.</p>
