    <h3>A User-Centered Investigation of Personal Music Tours (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Gabbolini, Derek Bridge</p>
    <p>Streaming services use recommender systems to surface the right music to users. Playlists are a popular way to present music in a list-like fashion, i.e. as a plain list of songs. An alternative are tours, where the songs alternate with segues, which explain the connections between consecutive songs. Tours address the user need of seeking background information about songs, and are found to be superior to playlists, given the right user context. In this work, we provide, for the first time, a user-centered evaluation of two tour-generation algorithms (Greedy and Optimal) using semi-structured interviews. We assess the algorithms, we discuss attributes of the tours that the algorithms produce, we identify which attributes are desirable and which are not, and we enumerate several possible improvements to the algorithms, along with practical suggestions on how to implement the improvements. Our main findings are that Greedy generates more likeable tours than Optimal, and that three important attributes of tours are segue diversity, song arrangement and song familiarity. More generally, we provide insights into how to present music to users, which could inform the design of user-centered recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Pick &amp; Merge: An Efficient Item Filtering Scheme for Windows Store Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nir Nice, Adi Makmal, Liron Allerhand, Jonathan Ephrath, Hilik Berezin, Noam Koenigstein</p>
    <p>Microsoft Windows is the most popular operating system (OS) for personal computers (PCs). With hundreds of millions of users, its app marketplace, Windows Store, is one of the largest in the world. As such, special considerations are required in order to improve online computational efficiency and response times. This paper presents the results of an extensive research of effective filtering method for semi-personalized recommendations. The filtering problem, defined here for the first time, addresses an aspect that was so far largely overlooked by the recommender systems literature, namely effective and efficient method for removing items from semi-personalized recommendation lists. Semi-personalized recommendation lists serve a common list to a group of people based on their shared interest or background. Unlike fully personalized lists, these lists are cacheable and constitute the majority of recommendation lists in many online stores. This motivates the following question: can we remove (most of) the usersâ€™ undesired items without collapsing onto fully personalized recommendations?Our solution is based on dividing the users into few subgroups, such that each subgroup receives a different variant of the original recommendation list. This approach adheres to the principles of semi-personalization and hence preserves simplicity and cacheability. We formalize the problem of finding optimal subgroups that minimize the total number of filtering errors, and show that it is combinatorially formidable. Consequently, a greedy algorithm is proposed that filters out most of the undesired items, while bounding the maximal number of errors for each user. Finally, a detailed evaluation of the proposed algorithm is presented using both proprietary and public datasets. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Greedy Optimized Multileaving for Personalization (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kojiro Iizuka, Yoshifumi Seki, Takeshi Yoneda</p>
    <p>Personalization plays an important role in many services. To evaluate personalized rankings, online evaluation, such as A/B testing, is widely used today. Recently, multileaving has been found to be an efficient method for evaluating rankings in information retrieval fields. This paper describes the first attempt to optimize the multileaving method for personalization settings. We clarify the challenges of applying this method to personalized rankings. Then, to solve these challenges, we propose greedy optimized multileaving (GOM) with a new credit feedback function. The empirical results showed that GOM was stable for increasing ranking lengths and the number of rankers. We implemented GOM on our actual news recommender systems, and compared its online performance. The results showed that GOM evaluated the personalized rankings precisely, with significantly smaller sample sizes (< 1/10) than A/B testing. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>
