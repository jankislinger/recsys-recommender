    <h3>Widespread flaws in offline evaluation of recommender systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ádám Tibor Czapp, Balázs Hidasi</p>
    <p>Even though offline evaluation is just an imperfect proxy of online performance — due to the interactive nature of recommenders — it will probably remain the primary way of evaluation in recommender systems research for the foreseeable future, since the proprietary nature of production recommenders prevents independent validation of A/B test setups and verification of online results. Therefore, it is imperative that offline evaluation setups are as realistic and as flawless as they can be. Unfortunately, evaluation flaws are quite common in recommenders systems research nowadays, due to later works copying flawed evaluation setups from their predecessors without questioning their validity. In the hope of improving the quality of offline evaluation of recommender systems, we discuss four of these widespread flaws and why researchers should avoid them.</p>

    <h3>Enhancing Counterfactual Evaluation and Learning for Recommendation Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolò Felicioni</p>
    <p>Evaluating recommendation systems is a task of utmost importance and a very active research field. While online evaluation is the most reliable evaluation procedure, it may also be too expensive to perform, if not unfeasible. Therefore, researchers and practitioners resort to offline evaluation. Offline evaluation is much more efficient and scalable, but traditional approaches suffer from high bias. This issue led to the increased popularity of counterfactual techniques. These techniques are used for evaluation and learning in recommender systems and reduce the bias in offline evaluation. While counterfactual approaches have a solid statistical basis, their application to recommendation systems is still in a preliminary research phase. In this paper, we identify some limitations of counterfactual techniques applied to recommender systems, and we propose possible ways to overcome them.</p>
