    <h3>LyricLure: Mining Catchy Hooks in Song Lyrics to Enhance Music Discovery and Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tarun Sharma, Siddharth Sharma, Joaquin Delgado, Ajinkya Walimbe, Akshay Shukla</p>
    <p>Amazon Music encounters a significant challenge as users increasingly rely on catchy lines from lyrics to search for both new releases and other popular songs. Integrating lyrics into existing lexical search index or using lyrics vector index pose difficulties due to lyrics text length. While lexical scoring mechanisms like BM25 are inadequate and necessitates complex query planning and index schema for long text, text embedding similarity based techniques often retrieve noisy near-similar meaning lyrics, resulting in low precision. This paper introduces a proactive approach to extract catchy phrases from song lyrics, overcoming the limitations of conventional graph-based phrase extractors and deep learning models, which are primarily designed for extractive summarization or task-specific key phrase extraction from domain-specific corpora. Additionally, we employ a multi-step mechanism to mine search query logs for potential unresolved user queries containing catchy phrases from lyrics. This involves creation of word and character k-gram index for lyric chunks, careful query and lyrics domain-centric normalization (and expansion) and a re-ranking layer incorporating lexical and well as semantic similarity. Together these strategies helped us create a high retrieval source specifically for serving lyrics intent queries with high recall.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation Systems for Ad Creation: A View from the Trenches (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manisha Verma, Shaunak Mishra</p>
    <p>Creative design is one of the key components of generating engaging content on the web. E-commerce websites need engaging product descriptions, social networks require user posts to have different types of content such as videos, images and hashtags, and traditional media formats such as blogs require content creators to constantly innovate their writing style, and choice of content they publish to engage with their intended audience. Designing the right content, irrespective of the industry, is a time consuming task, often requires several iterations of content selection and modification. Advertising is one such industry where content is the key to capture user interest and generate revenue. Designing engaging and attention grabbing advertisements requires extensive domain knowledge and market trend awareness. This motivates companies to hire marketing specialists to design specific advertising content, most often tasked to create text, image or video advertisements. This process is tedious and iterative which limits the amount of content that can be produced manually. In this talk, we summarize our work focused on automating ad creative design by leveraging state of the art approaches in text mining, ranking, generation, multimodal (visual-linguistic) representations, multilingual text understanding, and recommendation. We discuss how such approaches can help to reduce the time spent on designing ads, and showcase their impact on real world advertising systems and metrics.</p>

    <h3>T-RecS: A Framework for a Temporal Semantic Analysis of the ACM Recommender Systems Conference (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Lops, Fedelucio Narducci, Marco De Gemmis, Giovanni Semeraro, Pierpaolo Basile</p>
    <p>This paper presents T-RecS (Temporal analysis of Recommender Systems conference proceedings), a framework that supplies services to analyze the Recommender Systems Conference proceedings from the first edition, held in 2007, to the last one, held in 2015, under a temporal point of view. The idea behind T-RecS is to identify linguistic phenomena that reflect some interesting variations for the research community, such as topic drift, or how the correlation between two terms changed over time, or how similarity between two authors evolved over time. The implemented framework can be easily adapted for the analysis of different corpora and domains.</p>

    <h3>Dish Discovery via Word Embeddings on Restaurant Reviews (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Fan Chu, Yi Ho, Ming-Feng Tsai, Chuan-Ju Wang, Chih-Yu Chao</p>
    <p>This paper proposes a novel framework for automatic dish discovery via word embeddings on restaurant reviews. We collect a dataset of user reviews from Yelp and parse the reviews to extract dish words. Then, we utilize the processed reviews as training texts to learn the embedding vectors of words via the skip-gram model. In the paper, a nearest- neighbor like score function is proposed to rank the dishes based on their learned representations. We brief some analyses on the preliminary experiments and present a web-based visualization at http://clip.csie.org/yelp/.</p>

    <h3>Convolutional Matrix Factorization for Document Context-Aware Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hwanjo Yu, Sungyong Lee, Jinoh Oh, Chanyoung Park, Donghyun Kim</p>
    <p>Sparseness of user-to-item rating data is one of the major factors that deteriorate the quality of recommender system. To handle the sparsity problem, several recommendation techniques have been proposed that additionally consider auxiliary information to improve rating prediction accuracy. In particular, when rating data is sparse, document modeling-based approaches have improved the accuracy by additionally utilizing textual data such as reviews, abstracts, or synopses. However, due to the inherent limitation of the bag-of-words model, they have difficulties in effectively utilizing contextual information of the documents, which leads to shallow understanding of the documents. This paper proposes a novel context-aware recommendation model, convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF) that integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) into probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF). Consequently, ConvMF captures contextual information of documents and further enhances the rating prediction accuracy. Our extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets show that ConvMF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation models even when the rating data is extremely sparse. We also demonstrate that ConvMF successfully captures subtle contextual difference of a word in a document. Our implementation and datasets are available at http://dm.postech.ac.kr/ConvMF.</p>

    <h3>LinkedIn Skills: Large-Scale Topic Extraction and Inference (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Lloyd, Matthew Hayes, Mathieu Bastian, Sam Shah, William Vaughan, Peter Skomoroch, Hyungjin Kim, Sal Uryasev</p>
    <p>“Skills and Expertise” is a data-driven feature on LinkedIn, the world’s largest professional online social network, which allows members to tag themselves with topics representing their areas of expertise. In this work, we present our experiences developing this large-scale topic extraction pipeline, which includes constructing a folksonomy of skills and expertise and implementing an inference and recommender system for skills. We also discuss a consequent set of applications, such as Endorsements, which allows members to tag themselves with topics representing their areas of expertise and for their connections to provide social proof, via an “endorse” action, of that member’s competence in that topic.</p>

    <h3>Random Walk with Wait and Restart on Document Co-citation Network for Similar Document Search (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masaki Eto</p>
    <p>One of the latest algorithms for computing similarities between nodes in a graph is Random Walk with Restart (RWR). However, on a document co-citation network for similar document search, computing transition probabilities remains difficult. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a Random Walk with Wait and Restart (RWWR) algorithm, which contains a new technique for adjusting the transition probability by incorporating a “selfreturning” edge into the normalization. To evaluate its effectiveness empirically, the search performance of two retrieval methods using RWWR was compared to a method using the standard RWR; the performance was measured by average precision and nDCG. The experiment was conducted on a test collection created from the Open Access Subset of PubMed Central, and the results indicated that the RWWR methods tend to outperform the standard RWR method.</p>
