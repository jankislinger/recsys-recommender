    <h3>A Method to Anonymize Business Metrics to Publishing Implicit Feedback Datasets (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takanori Maehara, Yoshifumi Seki</p>
    <p>This paper shows a method for building and publishing datasets in commercial services. Datasets contribute to the development of research in machine learning and recommender systems. In particular, because recommender systems play a central role in many commercial services, publishing datasets from the services are in great demand from the recommender system community. However, the publication of datasets by commercial services may have some business risks to those companies. To publish a dataset, this must be approved by a business manager of the service. Because many business managers are not specialists in machine learning or recommender systems, the researchers are responsible for explaining to them the risks and benefits.<br>We first summarize three challenges in building datasets from commercial services: (1) anonymize the business metrics, (2) maintain fairness, and (3) reduce the popularity bias. Then, we formulate the problem of building and publishing datasets as an optimization problem that seeks the sampling weight of users, where the challenges are encoded as appropriate loss functions. We applied our method to build datasets from the raw data of our real-world mobile news delivery service. The raw data has more than 1,000,000 users with 100,000,000 interactions. Each dataset was built in less than 10 minutes. We discussed the properties of our method by checking the statistics of the datasets and the performances of typical recommender system algorithms.</p>
