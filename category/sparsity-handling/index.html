    <h3>Scalable Approximate NonSymmetric Autoencoder for Collaborative Filtering (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ladislav Peška, Radek Bartyzal, Antonín Hoskovec, Martin Spišák, Miroslav Tůma</p>
    <p>In the field of recommender systems, shallow autoencoders have recently gained significant attention. One of the most highly acclaimed shallow autoencoders is EASE, favored for its competitive recommendation accuracy and simultaneous simplicity. However, the poor scalability of EASE (both in time and especially in memory) severely restricts its use in production environments with vast item sets. In this paper, we propose a hyperefficient factorization technique for sparse approximate inversion of the data-Gram matrix used in EASE. The resulting autoencoder, SANSA, is an end-to-end sparse solution with prescribable density and almost arbitrarily low memory requirements (even for training). As such, SANSA allows us to effortlessly scale the concept of EASE to millions of items and beyond.</p>

    <h3>Learning to Rank with Trust and Distrust in Recommender Systems (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Rafailidis, Fabio Crestani</p>
    <p>The sparsity of users’ preferences can significantly degrade the quality of recommendations in the collaborative filtering strategy. To account for the fact that the selections of social friends and foes may improve the recommendation accuracy, we propose a learning to rank model that exploits users’ trust and distrust relationships. Our learning to rank model focusses on the performance at the top of the list, with the recommended items that end-users will actually see. In our model, we try to push the relevant items of users and their friends at the top of the list, while ranking low those of their foes. Furthermore, we propose a weighting strategy to capture the correlations of users’ preferences with friends’ trust and foes’ distrust degrees in two intermediate trust- and distrust-preference user latent spaces, respectively. Our experiments on the Epinions dataset show that the proposed learning to rank model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in the presence of sparsity in users’ preferences and when a part of trust and distrust relationships is not available. Furthermore, we demonstrate the crucial role of our weighting strategy in our model, to balance well the influences of friends and foes on users’ preferences.</p>

    <h3>It Takes Two to Tango: an Exploration of Domain Pairs for Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaghayegh Sahebi, Peter Brusilovsky</p>
    <p>As the heterogeneity of data sources are increasing on the web, and due to the sparsity of data in each of these data sources, cross-domain recommendation is becoming an emerging research topic in the recent years. Cross-domain collaborative filtering aims to transfer the user rating pattern from source (auxiliary) domains to a target domain for the purpose of alleviating the sparsity problem and providing better target recommendations. However, the studies so far have either focused on a limited number of domains that are assumed to be related to each other (such as books and movies), or a division of the same dataset (such as movies) into different domains based on an item characteristic (such as genre). In this paper, we study a broad set of domains and their characteristics to understand the factors that affect the success or failure of cross-domain collaborative filtering, the amount of improvement in cross-domain approaches, and the selection of best source domains for a specific target domain. We propose to use Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) as a significant major factor in finding the most promising source domains for a target domain, and suggest a cross-domain collaborative filtering based on CCA (CD-CCA) that proves to be successful in using the shared information between domains in the target recommendations.</p>
