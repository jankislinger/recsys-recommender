    <h3>Adaptive Fusion of Multi-View for Graph Contrastive Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Zhou, Jianwei Yin, Meng Xi, Ying Li, Mengduo Yang, Xiaohua Pan, Yi Yuan, Yangyang Wu, Jinshan Zhang</p>
    <p>Recommendation is a key mechanism for modern users to access items of their interests from massive entities and information. Recently, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has demonstrated satisfactory results on recommendation, due to its ability to enhance representation by integrating graph neural networks (GNNs) with contrastive learning. However, those methods often generate contrastive views by performing random perturbation on edges or embeddings, which is likely to bring noise in representation learning. Besides, in all these methods, the degree of user preference on items is omitted during the representation learning process, which may cause incomplete user/item modeling. To address these limitations, we propose the Adaptive Fusion of Multi-View Graph Contrastive Recommendation (AMGCR) model. Specifically, to generate the informative and less noisy views for better contrastive learning, we design four view generators to learn the edge weights focusing on weight adjustment, feature transformation, neighbor aggregation, and attention mechanism, respectively. Then, we employ an adaptive multi-view fusion module to combine different views from both the view-shared and the view-specific levels. Moreover, to make the model capable of capturing preference information during the learning process, we further adopt a preference refinement strategy on the fused contrastive view. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AMGCR consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, with average improvements of over 10% in terms of Recall and NDCG.</p>

    <h3>A Pre-trained Zero-shot Sequential Recommendation Framework via Popularity Dynamics (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hari Sundaram, Junting Wang, Praneet Rathi</p>
    <p>This paper proposes a novel pre-trained framework for zero-shot cross-domain  sequential recommendation without auxiliary information. While using auxiliary information (e.g., item descriptions) seems promising for cross-domain transfer, a cross-domain adaptation of sequential recommenders can be challenging when the target domain differs from the source domain—item descriptions are in different languages; metadata modalities (e.g., audio, image, and text) differ across source and target domains. If we can learn universal item representations independent of the domain type (e.g., groceries, movies), we can achieve zero-shot cross-domain transfer without auxiliary information. Our critical insight is that user interaction sequences highlight shifting user preferences via the popularity dynamics of interacted items. We present a pre-trained sequential recommendation framework: PrepRec, which utilizes a novel popularity dynamics-aware transformer architecture. Through extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, we show that PrepRec, without any auxiliary information, can zero-shot adapt to new application domains and achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art sequential recommender models. In addition, we show that PrepRec complements existing sequential recommenders. With a simple post-hoc interpolation, PrepRec improves the performance of existing sequential recommenders on average by 11.8% in Recall@10 and 22% in NDCG@10. We provide an anonymized implementation of PrepRec at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PrepRec–128E/}.</p>

    <h3>Unlocking the Hidden Treasures: Enhancing Recommendations with Unlabeled Data (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Chen, Li Chen, Hongtao Song, Yuhan Zhao, Qilong Han</p>
    <p>Collaborative filtering (CF) stands as a cornerstone in recommender systems, yet effectively leveraging the vast reservoir of unlabeled data presents a persistent challenge. Current research endeavors to address the challenge of unlabeled data by extracting a subset closely approximating negative samples. Regrettably, the remaining data are overlooked, failing to fully integrate this valuable information into the construction of user preferences. To address this gap, we introduce a novel positive-neutral-negative (PNN) learning paradigm. PNN introduces a neutral class, encompassing intricate items challenging to categorize directly as positive or negative samples. By training a model based on this triple-wise partial ranking, PNN offers a promising solution to learning complex user preferences. Through theoretical analysis, we connect PNN to one-way partial AUC (OPAUC) to validate its efficacy. Implementing the PNN paradigm is, however, technically challenging because: (1) it is difficult to classify unobserved items into neutral or negative in the absence of supervisory signals; (2) there does not exist any loss function that can handle set-level triple-wise ranking relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a semi-supervised learning method coupled with a user-aware attention model for knowledge acquisition and classification refinement. Additionally, a novel loss function and two-step centroid ranking approach enable handling set-level rankings. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that, when combined with PNN, a wide range of representative CF models can consistently and significantly boost their performance. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PNN-RecBole-4E04.</p>

    <h3>Balancing Habit Repetition and New Activity Exploration: A Longitudinal Micro-Randomized Trial in Physical Activity Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ine Coppens, Luc Martens, Toon De Pessemier</p>
    <p>As repetition of activities can establish habits and exploration of new ones can provide a healthy variety, we investigate how a recommender system for physical activities can optimally balance these two approaches. We conducted an eight-week user study with 62 physically inactive participants who receive personalized repetition and exploration recommendations in a random order. We distinguish between location, workout, and general activities, and collect participants’ subjective perceptions. Our findings indicate that participants initially preferred exploring general activities, but rated repeating recommendations higher after two weeks. By exploring the optimal transition point from exploration to repetition in personalized recommendations, this study contributes to designing more effective recommender systems for health improvement and healthy habit formation.</p>

    <h3>Looks Can Be Deceiving: Linking User-Item Interactions and User’s Propensity Towards Multi-Objective Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Boratto, Patrik Dokoupil, Ladislav Peska</p>
    <p>Multi-objective recommender systems (MORS) provide suggestions to users according to multiple (and possibly conflicting) goals. When a system optimizes its results at the individual-user level, it tailors them on a user’s propensity towards the different objectives. Hence, the capability to understand users’ fine-grained needs towards each goal is crucial. In this paper, we present the results of a user study in which we monitored the way users interacted with recommended items, as well as their self-proclaimed propensities towards relevance, novelty and diversity objectives. The study was divided into several sessions, where users evaluated recommendation lists originating from a relevance-only single-objective baseline as well as MORS. We show that despite MORS-based recommendations attracted less selections, its presence in the early sessions is crucial for users’ satisfaction in the later stages. Surprisingly, the self-proclaimed willingness of users to interact with novel and diverse items is not always reflected in the recommendations they accept. Post-study questionnaires provide insights on how to deal with this matter, suggesting that MORS-based results should be accompanied by elements that allow users to understand the recommendations, so as to facilitate their acceptance.</p>

    <h3>When Fairness meets Bias: a Debiased Framework for Fairness aware Top-N Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Gong, Jingsen Zhang, Jiakai Tang, Xu Chen, Shiqi Shen, Zhipeng Wang</p>
    <p>Fairness in the recommendation domain has recently attracted increasing attention due to the more and more concerns on the algorithm discrimination and ethics. While recent years have witnessed many promising fairness aware recommender models, an important problem has been largely ignored, that is, the fairness can be biased due to the user personalized selection tendencies or the non-uniform item exposure probabilities. To study this problem, in this paper, we formally define a novel task named as unbiased fairness aware Top-N recommendation. For solving this task, we firstly define an ideal loss function based on all the user-item pairs. Considering that, in real-world datasets, only a small number of user-item interactions can be observed, we then approximate the above ideal loss with a more tractable objective based on the inverse propensity score (IPS). Since the recommendation datasets can be noisy and quite sparse, which brings difficulties for accurately estimating the IPS, we propose to optimize the objective in an IPS range instead of a specific point, which improve the model fault tolerance capability. In order to make our model more applicable to the commonly studied Top-N recommendation, we soften the ranking metrics such as Precision, Hit-Ratio and NDCG to derive an fully differentiable framework. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model based on four real-world datasets.</p>

    <h3>Beyond Labels: Leveraging Deep Learning and LLMs for Content Metadata (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaya Kawale, Saurabh Agrawal, John Trenkle</p>
    <p>Content metadata plays a very important role in movie recommender systems as it provides valuable information about various aspects of a movie such as genre, cast, plot synopsis, box office summary, etc. Analyzing the metadata can help understand the user preferences and generate personalized recommendations catering to the niche tastes of the users. It can also help with content cold starting when the recommender system has little or no interaction data available to perform collaborative filtering. In this talk, we will focus on one particular type of metadata – genre labels. Genre labels associated with a movie or a TV series such as “horror” or “comedy” or “romance” help categorize a collection of movies into different themes and correspondingly setting up the audience expectation for a title. We present some of the challenges associated with using genre label information via traditional methods and propose a new way of examining the genre information that we call as the Genre Spectrum. The Genre Spectrum helps capture the various nuanced genres in a title and our offline and online experiments corroborate the effectiveness of the approach.</p>

    <h3>Beyond the Sequence: Statistics-driven Pre-training for Stabilizing Sequential Recommendation Model (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongzhi Zhang, Sirui Wang, Yunsen Xian, Peiguang Li</p>
    <p>The sequential recommendation task aims to predict the item that user is interested in according to his/her historical action sequence. However, inevitable random action, i.e. user randomly accesses an item among multiple candidates or clicks several items at random order, cause the sequence fails to provide stable and high-quality signals. To alleviate the issue, we propose the StatisTics-Driven Pre-traing framework (called STDP briefly). The main idea of the work lies in the exploration of utilizing the statistics information along with the pre-training paradigm to stabilize the optimization of recommendation model. Specifically, we derive two types of statistical information: item co-occurrence across sequence and attribute frequency within the sequence. And we design the following pre-training tasks: 1) The co-occurred items prediction task, which encourages the model to distribute its attention on multiple suitable targets instead of just focusing on the next item that may be unstable. 2) We generate a paired sequence by replacing items with their co-occurred items and enforce its representation close with the original one, thus enhancing the model’s robustness to the random noise. 3) To reduce the impact of random on user’s long-term preferences, we encourage the model to capture sequence-level frequent attributes. The significant improvement over six datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposal, and further analysis verified the generalization of the STDP framework on other models.</p>

    <h3>Personalised Recommendations for the BBC iPlayer: Initial approach and current challenges (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Polina Proutskova, Benjamin R. Clark, Duncan M. Walker, Kristine Grivcova</p>
    <p>BBC iPlayer is one of the most important digital products of the BBC, offering live and on-demand television for audiences in the UK with over 10 million weekly active users. The BBC’s role as a public service broadcaster, broadcasting over traditional linear channels as well as online presents a number of challenges for a recommender system. In addition to having substantially different objectives to a commercial service, we show that the diverse content offered by the BBC including news and sport, factual, drama and live events lead to a catalogue with a diversity of consumption patterns, depending on genre. Our research shows that simple models represent strong baselines in this system. We discuss our initial attempts to improve upon these baselines, and conclude with our current challenges.</p>

    <h3>BRUCE – Bundle Recommendation Using Contextualized item Embeddings (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Livne, Bracha Shapira, Oren Sar Shalom, Mark Last, Tzoof Avny Brosh</p>
    <p>A bundle is a pre-defined set of items that are collected together. In many domains, bundling is one of the most important marketing strategies for item promotion, commonly used in e-commerce. Bundle recommendation resembles the item recommendation task, where bundles are the recommended unit, but it poses additional challenges; while item recommendation requires only user and item understanding, bundle recommendation also requires modeling the connections between the various items in a bundle. Transformers have driven the state-of-the-art methods for set and sequence modeling in various natural language processing and computer vision tasks, emphasizing the understanding that the neighbors of an element are of crucial importance. Under some required adjustments, we believe the same applies for items in bundles, and better capturing the relations of an item with other items in the bundle may lead to improved recommendations. To address that, we introduce BRUCE - a novel model for bundle recommendation, in which we adapt Transformers to represent data on users, items, and bundles. This allows exploiting the self-attention mechanism to model the following: latent relations between the items in a bundle; and users’ preferences toward each of the items in the bundle and toward the whole bundle. Moreover, we examine various architectures to integrate the items’ and the users’ information and provide insights on architecture selection based on data characteristics. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach contributes to the accuracy of the recommendation and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods</p>

    <h3>Learning Users’ Preferred Visual Styles in an Image Marketplace (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandra Sala, Raul Gomez Bruballa, Lauren Burnham-King</p>
    <p>Providing meaningful recommendations in a content marketplace is challenging due to the fact that users are not the final content consumers. Instead, most users are creatives whose interests, linked to the projects they work on, change rapidly and abruptly. To address the challenging task of recommending images to content creators, we design a RecSys that learns visual styles preferences transversal to the semantics of the projects users work on. We analyze the challenges of the task compared to content-based recommendations driven by semantics, propose an evaluation setup, and explain its applications in a global image marketplace.</p>

    <h3>A User-Centered Investigation of Personal Music Tours (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Gabbolini, Derek Bridge</p>
    <p>Streaming services use recommender systems to surface the right music to users. Playlists are a popular way to present music in a list-like fashion, i.e. as a plain list of songs. An alternative are tours, where the songs alternate with segues, which explain the connections between consecutive songs. Tours address the user need of seeking background information about songs, and are found to be superior to playlists, given the right user context. In this work, we provide, for the first time, a user-centered evaluation of two tour-generation algorithms (Greedy and Optimal) using semi-structured interviews. We assess the algorithms, we discuss attributes of the tours that the algorithms produce, we identify which attributes are desirable and which are not, and we enumerate several possible improvements to the algorithms, along with practical suggestions on how to implement the improvements. Our main findings are that Greedy generates more likeable tours than Optimal, and that three important attributes of tours are segue diversity, song arrangement and song familiarity. More generally, we provide insights into how to present music to users, which could inform the design of user-centered recommender systems.</p>

    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cataldo Musto, Marco de Gemmis, Giuseppe Spillo, Pasquale Lops, Giovanni Semeraro</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present a knowledge-aware recommendation framework based on neuro-symbolic graph embeddings that encode first-order logical (FOL) rules. In particular, our workflow starts from a knowledge graph (KG) encoding user preferences (based on explicit ratings [13]) and item properties. Next, knowledge-aware recommendation are obtained through the combination of three modules: (i) a rule learner, that extracts FOL rules from the KG; (ii) a graph embedding module, that learns the embeddings of users and items based on the triples of the KG and the FOL rules previously extracted; (iii) a recommendation module that uses the embeddings to feed a deep learning architecture. In the experimental session, we evaluate the effectiveness of our strategy on two datasets and the results show that the combination of KG embeddings and FOL rules led to an improvement in the accuracy and in the novelty of the recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Leveraging Multi-Faceted User Preferences for Improving Click-Through Rate Predictions (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan Li</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have been widely adopted by many firms across various industries over the past decade, as they could provide numerous economic benefits to the industry, such as influencing consumer choices, generating the lift in sales, and enhancing consumer trust. Many currently-deployed recommender systems primiarily optimize the similarity measure following the Collaborative Filtering paradigm during the recommendation performance, which focuses on the matching between targeted users and items of their interests. Although effective and useful in many cases, these still face several important challenges to fully address consumers’ concerns. In particular, they usually provide recommendations of the most similar items related to the consumption records, without taking into account the multi-faceted consumer preferences. For example, some consumers would be satisfied to receive recommendations that are novel and unexpected to broaden their horizons, while others might be interested to receive recommendations from other product categories to expand their interests. Falling to do so would lead to the filter bubble and exploration-exploitation trade-off phenomenon, which is undesirable because it would significantly reduce sales diversity and deteriorate user satisfaction with recommender systems.<br>In my thesis proposal, I will describe new methods to design recommender systems following two research streams to tackle the aforementioned challenges, namely unexpected recommender system and cross-domain system. In particular, unexpected recommender systems address consumers’ desire for variety, and aim at providing novel and useful recommendations simultaneously, while cross-domain recommender systems learn consumer preferences from their behaviors in other domains to better predict their behaviors in the target domain. The proposed models are capable of significantly improving recommendation performance and user satisfaction, as demonstrated through extensive offline and online experiments discussed in this proposal.</p>

We have developed different variants of a movie recommender system prototype corresponding to different types of explanations and conducted an online user study to evaluate related explanations. The experimental results show that users do not always appreciate explanations. They want to see explanations when they are not satisfied with the recommended items. They expect to see explanations showing how well the recommended item meets their preferences. Moreover, explanation goals are interdependent and affect the overall satisfaction of users with the recommender system.</p>

Findings offer insights for the design of recommender algorithms that would look beyond patterns inferred from traditional user-system interactions (e.g., ratings) for recommendation purposes, since when it comes to children such data is rarely, if at all, available.</p>
