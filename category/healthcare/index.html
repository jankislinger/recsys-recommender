    <h3>Understanding Fairness in Recommender Systems: A Healthcare Perspective (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veronica Kecki, Alan Said</p>
    <p>Fairness in AI-driven decision-making systems has become a critical concern, especially when these systems directly affect human lives. This paper explores the public’s comprehension of fairness in healthcare recommendations. We conducted a survey where participants selected from four fairness metrics – Demographic Parity, Equal Accuracy, Equalized Odds, and Positive Predictive Value – across different healthcare scenarios to assess their understanding of these concepts. Our findings reveal that fairness is a complex and often misunderstood concept, with a generally low level of public understanding regarding fairness metrics in recommender systems. This study highlights the need for enhanced information and education on algorithmic fairness to support informed decision-making in using these systems. Furthermore, the results suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach to fairness may be insufficient, pointing to the importance of context-sensitive designs in developing equitable AI systems.</p>

    <h3>Learning Personalized Health Recommendations via Offline Reinforcement Learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Larry Preuett</p>
    <p>The healthcare industry is strained and would benefit from personalized treatment plans for treating various health conditions (e.g., HIV and diabetes). Reinforcement Learning is a promising approach to learning such sequential recommendation systems. However, applying reinforcement learning in the medical domain is challenging due to the lack of adequate evaluation metrics, partial observability, and the inability to explore due to safety concerns. In this line of work, we identify three research directions to improve the applicability of treatment plans learned using offline reinforcement learning.</p>

    <h3>A New Perspective in Health Recommendations: Integration of Human Pose Estimation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaetano Dibenedetto</p>
    <p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in multimodal and multi-source data due to their ability to introduce heterogeneous information. Studies have demonstrated that combining such information enhances the performance of Recommender Systems across various scenarios. In the context of Health Recommendation Systems (HRS), different types of data are utilized, primarily focusing on patient-based information, but data from Pose Estimations (PE) are not incorporated. The objective of my Ph.D. is to investigate methods to design and develop HRS that treat the PE as one of the input sources, taking into account aspects such as privacy concerns and balancing the trade-off between system quality and responsiveness. By leveraging the combination of diverse information sources, I intend to create a new model in the area of HRS capable of providing more precise and explainable recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Effective Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning in Contextual Combinatorial Bandits (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuta Saito, Tatsuhiro Shimizu, Ren Kishimoto, Masahiro Nomura, Koichi Tanaka, Haruka Kiyohara</p>
    <p>We explore off-policy evaluation and learning in contextual combinatorial bandits (CCB), where a policy selects a subset in the action space. For example, it might choose a set of furniture pieces (a bed and a drawer) from available items (bed, drawer, chair, etc.) for interior design sales. This setting is widespread in fields such as recommender systems and healthcare, yet OPE/L of CCB remains unexplored in the relevant literature. Standard OPE methods typically employ regression and importance sampling in the action subset space. However, they often face significant challenges due to high bias or variance, exacerbated by the exponential growth in the number of available subsets. To address these challenges, we introduce a concept of factored action space, which allows us to decompose each subset into binary indicators. These indicators signify whether each action is included in the selected subset. This formulation allows us to distinguish between the “main effect” derived from the main actions, and the “residual effect”, originating from the supplemental actions, facilitating more effective OPE. Specifically, our estimator, called OPCB, leverages an importance sampling-based approach to unbiasedly estimate the main effect, while employing regression-based approach to deal with the residual effect with low variance. OPCB achieves substantial variance reduction compared to conventional importance sampling methods and bias reduction relative to regression methods under certain conditions, as illustrated in our theoretical analysis. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate OPCB’s superior performance over the typical methods, particularly when navigating the complexities of a large action subset space.</p>

    <h3>ADRNet: A Generalized Collaborative Filtering Framework Combining Clinical and Non-Clinical Data for Adverse Drug Reaction Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Hua Zhou, Zetong Xiong, Taojun Hu, Chunyuan Zheng, Haoxuan Li, Fuli Feng, Xiangnan He</p>
    <p>Adverse drug reaction (ADR) prediction plays a crucial role in both health care and drug discovery for reducing patient mortality and enhancing drug safety. Recently, many studies have been devoted to effectively predict the drug-ADRs incidence rates. However, these methods either did not effectively utilize non-clinical data, i.e., physical, chemical, and biological information about the drug, or did little to establish a link between content-based and pure collaborative filtering during the training phase. In this paper, we first formulate the prediction of multi-label ADRs as a drug-ADR collaborative filtering problem, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide extensive benchmark results of previous collaborative filtering methods on two large publicly available clinical datasets. Then, by exploiting the easy accessible drug characteristics from non-clinical data, we propose ADRNet, a generalized collaborative filtering framework combining clinical and non-clinical data for drug-ADR prediction. Specifically, ADRNet has a shallow collaborative filtering module and a deep drug representation module, which can exploit the high-dimensional drug descriptors to further  guide the learning of low-dimensional ADR latent embeddings, which incorporates both the benefits of collaborative filtering and representation learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on two publicly available real-world drug-ADR clinical datasets and two non-clinical datasets to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed ADRNet.</p>

    <h3>Analyzing Accuracy versus Diversity in a Health Recommender System for Physical Activities: a Longitudinal User Study (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luc Martens, Toon De Pessemier, Ine Coppens</p>
    <p>As personalization has great potential to improve mobile health apps, analyzing the effect of different recommender algorithms in the health domain is still in its infancy. As such, this paper investigates whether more accurate recommendations from a content-based recommender or more diverse recommendations from a user-based collaborative filtering recommender will lead to more motivation to move. An eight-week longitudinal between-subject user study is being conducted with an Android app in which participants receive personalized recommendations for physical activities and tips to reduce sedentary behavior. The objective manipulation check confirmed that the group with collaborative filtering received significantly more diverse recommendations. The subjective manipulation check showed that the content-based group assigned more positive feedback for perceived accuracy and star rating to the recommendations they chose and executed. However, perceived diversity and inspiringness was significantly higher in the content-based group, suggesting that users might experience the recommendations differently. Lastly, momentary motivation for the executed activities and tips was significantly higher in the content-based group. As such, the preliminary results of this longitudinal study suggest that more accurate and less diverse recommendations have better effects on motivating users to move more.</p>

    <h3>Designing and evaluating explainable AI for non-AI experts: challenges and opportunities (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katrien Verbert, Vero Vanden Abeele, Maxwell Szymanski</p>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a steady increase in use in the health and medical field, where it is used by lay users and health experts alike. However, these AI systems often lack transparency regarding the inputs and decision making process (often called black boxes), which in turn can be detrimental to the user’s satisfaction and trust towards these systems. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to overcome this problem by opening up certain aspects of the black box, and has proven to be a successful means of increasing trust, transparency and even system effectiveness. However, for certain groups (i.e. lay users in health), explanation methods and evaluation metrics still remain underexplored. In this paper, we will outline our research regarding designing and evaluating explanations for health recommendations for lay users and domain experts, as well as list a few takeaways we were already able to find in our initial studies.</p>

    <h3>KA-Recsys: Knowledge Appropriate Patient Focused Recommendation Technologies (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khushboo Thaker</p>
    <p>Diseases such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease demand that patients take an active role in disease management and seek health information for decision-making and self-management [ 1]. The most common methods of providing reliable information to patients include health literacy workshops and patient education materials [12 , 15 ]. However, these materials are prepared for the general patient population and not always tailored to each patient’s specific needs [ 2, 12 ]. In addition, patients seek for their information needs through search engines. Previous studies have reported that search engines don’t always support information needs of patients [11 ]. Consequently, people seek information on disease specific online health communities (OHCs) [ 9 ]. But the risk of propagating misinformation still exists because existing OHCs do not provide an infrastructure to help patients find relevant and trustworthy information [ 8, 19 ].Existing patient focused health search engines and health recommender systems can accommodate better support of patients’ information needs by providing them trustworthy resources. However, current PHRS are personalized to patients’ interests and so information provided by these layperson-oriented systems is rather general [5, 6]. In fact, previous study has shown that a patient’s personal knowledge about their disease becomes more sophisticated over the course of disease [6 , 7]. Therefore, our principal motivation is to fill this gap in current PHRS, by investigating ways to suggest individualized health information that not only adapts to patients’ current information needs but also patients’ knowledge-level across the disease trajectory. The health materials recommended at the level of patients’ knowledge will not only help them engage with materials but also help in informed decision making and self management [16]. The goal of this research is to enhance state-of-the-art PHRS by exploring the technologies in the field of recommender systems and personalized learning so that PHRS can better suggest health information relevant to patients, which is appropriate to their changing knowledge level and in-line with their dynamic information need across their disease trajectory. Thus my research proposes a recommender that accommodates both patient interest and patient knowledge by integrating a patient knowledge model. The output of this research would be a knowledge-appropriate patient focused recommender system (KA-Recsys). As a case study, KA-Recsys will be implemented for ovarian cancer (OvCa) patients and integrated into HELPeR1.</p>

    <h3>An Interpretable Recommendation Model for Gerontological Care (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paula Castro, Andre Paulino de Lima, Maria Pimentel, Brunela Orlandi, Laurentino Augusto Dantas, Marcelo Garcia Manzato</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have been successfully applied to diverse areas, but their use in the healthcare domain is still rare. One challenge of applying recommender systems to this domain is related to legal concerns about the consequences of provided recommendations. In this work, we advance an expert-in-the-loop, explanation-first approach to tackle this challenge in a specific healthcare niche: gerontological care. A key aspect of the proposed approach is that both recommendations and explanations reflect the structured questionnaire employed by the practitioner to identify patient needs. Another key aspect is that a clinical dataset of patient assessments and respective assigned interventions is used to estimate effects of alternative interventions during the recommendation process. To evaluate the feasibility of this modelling approach, an explanation style was designed with help of practitioners, and a recommendation model was devised and evaluated against a clinical dataset, which was collected by a partner research group working on gerontological primary care. When compared to other traditional recommendation models, the attained precision was competitive across several evaluation conditions. The results suggest that the proposed approach is feasible and may point new ways of adapting recommender systems to play an assistive role in health care.</p>

    <h3>Offline Contextual Multi-armed Bandits for Mobile Health Interventions: A Case Study on Emotion Regulation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bethany Teachman, Laura E Barnes, Miranda L. Beltzer, Lihua Cai, Mehdi Boukhechba, Mawulolo Koku Ameko</p>
    <p>Delivering treatment recommendations via pervasive electronic devices such as mobile phones has the potential to be a viable and scalable treatment medium for long-term health behavior management. But active experimentation of treatment options can be time-consuming, expensive and altogether unethical in some cases. There is a growing interest in methodological approaches that allow an experimenter to learn and evaluate the usefulness of a new treatment strategy before deployment. We present the first development of a treatment recommender system for emotion regulation using real-world historical mobile digital data from n = 114 high socially anxious participants to test the usefulness of new emotion regulation strategies. We explore a number of offline contextual bandits estimators for learning and propose a general framework for learning algorithms. Our experimentation shows that the proposed doubly robust offline learning algorithms performed significantly better than baseline approaches, suggesting that this type of recommender algorithm could improve emotion regulation. Given that emotion regulation is impaired across many mental illnesses and such a recommender algorithm could be scaled up easily, this approach holds potential to increase access to treatment for many people. We also share some insights that allow us to translate contextual bandit models to this complex real-world data, including which contextual features appear to be most important for predicting emotion regulation strategy effectiveness.</p>

    <p>Training for the marathon is a complex problem. In order to run an optimal time, runners must find the right workload for their current abilities and identify the correct balance between the hard work and rest throughout their training programmes. We propose a recommender system that will help guide runners through the weeks leading up to the marathon. Using a large sample of marathon training data (8730 runners), we generate user profiles that capture both a runner’s current fitness and training levels, and leverage this information to generate tailored recommendations for future weeks of training. We investigate patterns of successful runners to determine how best to schedule recommendations and training to allow for improvement in fitness levels alongside adequate rest.</p>

    <h3>How Can They Know That? A Study of Factors Affecting the Creepiness of Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Catalin-Mihai Barbu, Jürgen Ziegler, Helma Torkamaan</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RS) often use implicit user preferences extracted from behavioral and contextual data, in addition to traditional rating-based preference elicitation, to increase the quality and accuracy of personalized recommendations. However, these approaches may harm user experience by causing mixed emotions, such as fear, anxiety, surprise, discomfort, or creepiness. RS should consider users’ feelings, expectations, and reactions that result from being shown personalized recommendations. This paper investigates the creepiness of recommendations using an online experiment in three domains: movies, hotels, and health. We define the feeling of creepiness caused by recommendations and find out that it is already known to users of RS. We further find out that the perception of creepiness varies across domains and depends on recommendation features, like causal ambiguity and accuracy. By uncovering possible consequences of creepy recommendations, we also learn that creepiness can have a negative influence on brand and platform attitudes, purchase or consumption intention, user experience, and users’ expectations of‚ and their trust in, RS. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Random Walk with Wait and Restart on Document Co-citation Network for Similar Document Search (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masaki Eto</p>
    <p>One of the latest algorithms for computing similarities between nodes in a graph is Random Walk with Restart (RWR). However, on a document co-citation network for similar document search, computing transition probabilities remains difficult. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a Random Walk with Wait and Restart (RWWR) algorithm, which contains a new technique for adjusting the transition probability by incorporating a “selfreturning” edge into the normalization. To evaluate its effectiveness empirically, the search performance of two retrieval methods using RWWR was compared to a method using the standard RWR; the performance was measured by average precision and nDCG. The experiment was conducted on a test collection created from the Open Access Subset of PubMed Central, and the results indicated that the RWWR methods tend to outperform the standard RWR method.</p>

    <p>The goal of computer tailored health communications (CTHC) is to elicit healthy behavior changes by sending motivational messages personalized to individual patients. One prominent weakness of many existing CTHC systems is that they are based on expert-written rules and thus have no ability to learn from their users over time. One solution to this problem is to develop CTHC systems based on the principles of collaborative filtering, but this approach has not been widely studied. In this paper, we present a case study evaluating nine rating prediction methods for use in the Patient Experience Recommender System for Persuasive Communication Tailoring, a system developed for use in a clinical trial of CTHC-based smoking cessation support interventions.</p>

    <h3>Clinical Online Recommendation with Subgroup Rank Feedback (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanan Sui, Joel Burdick</p>
    <p>Many real applications in experimental design need to make decisions online. Each decision leads to a stochastic reward with initially unknown distribution. New decisions are made based on the observations of previous rewards. To maximize the total reward, one needs to solve the tradeoff between exploring different strategies and exploiting currently optimal strategies. This kind of tradeoff problems can be formalized as Multi-armed bandit problem. We recommend strategies in series and generate new recommendations based on noisy rewards of previous strategies. When the reward for a strategy is difficult to quantify, classical bandit algorithms are no longer optimal. This paper, studies the Multi-armed bandit problem with feedback given as a stochastic rank list instead of quantified reward value. We propose an algorithm for this new problem and show its optimality. A real application of this algorithm on clinical treatment is helping paralyzed patient to regain the ability to stand on their own feet.</p>
