    <h3>Multi-Preview Recommendation via Reinforcement Learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuan-Ting Lai, Pengcheng Xiong, Zhong Wu, Yang Xu</p>
    <p>Preview recommendations serve as a crucial shortcut for attracting users’ attention on various systems, platforms, and webpages, significantly boosting user engagement. However, the variability of preview types and the flexibility of preview duration make it challenging to use an integrated framework for multi-preview recommendations under resource constraints. In this paper, we present an approach that incorporates constrained Q-learning into a notification recommendation system, effectively handling both multi-preview ranking and duration orchestration by targeting long-term user retention. Our method bridges the gap between combinatorial reinforcement learning, which often remains too theoretical for practical use, and segmented modules in production, where model performance is typically compromised due to over-simplification. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach through off-policy evaluation and online A/B testing using Microsoft data.</p>

    <h3>Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning for Dialog-based Interactive Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Craig Macdonald, Yaxiong Wu, Iadh Ounis</p>
    <p>A dialog-based interactive recommendation task is where users can express natural-language feedback when interacting with the recommender system. However, the users’ feedback, which takes the form of natural-language critiques about the recommendation at each iteration, can only allow the recommender system to obtain a partial portrayal of the users’ preferences. Indeed, such partial observations of the users’ preferences from their natural-language feedback make it challenging to correctly track the users’ preferences over time, which can result in poor recommendation performances and a less effective satisfaction of the users’ information needs when in presence of limited iterations. Reinforcement learning, in the form of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), can simulate the interactions between a partially observable environment (i.e. a user) and an agent (i.e. a recommender system). To alleviate such a partial observation issue, we propose a novel dialog-based recommendation model, the Estimator-Generator-Evaluator (EGE) model, with Q-learning for POMDP, to effectively incorporate the users’ preferences over time. Specifically, we leverage an Estimator to track and estimate users’ preferences, a Generator to match the estimated preferences with the candidate items to rank the next recommendations, and an Evaluator to judge the quality of the estimated preferences considering the users’ historical feedback. Following previous work, we train our EGE model by using a user simulator which itself is trained to describe the differences between the target users’ preferences and the recommended items in natural language. Thorough and extensive experiments conducted on two recommendation datasets – addressing images of fashion products (namely dresses and shoes) – demonstrate that our proposed EGE model yields significant improvements in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art baseline models.</p>
