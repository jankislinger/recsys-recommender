    <h3>Scalable Deep Q-Learning for Session-Based Slate Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aonghus Lawlor, Edoardo Dâ€™Amico, Aayush Singha Roy, Neil Hurley, Elias Tragos</p>
    <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential to improve slate-based recommender systems by optimizing recommendations for long-term user engagement. To handle the combinatorial action space in slate recommendation, recent works decompose the Q-value of a slate into item-wise Q-values, using an item-wise value-based policy. However, the common case where the value function is a parameterized function taking state and action as input results in a linearly increasing number of evaluations required to select an action, proportional to the number of candidate items. While slow training may be acceptable, this becomes intractable when considering the costly evaluation of the parameterized function, such as with deep neural networks, during model serving time. To address this issue, we propose an actor-based policy that reduces the evaluation of the Q-function to a subset of items, significantly reducing inference time and enabling practical deployment in real-world industrial settings. In our empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves equivalent user session engagement to a value-based policy, while significantly reducing the slate serving time by at least 4 times.</p>

    <h3>Tops, Bottoms, and Shoes: Building Capsule Wardrobes via Cross-Attention Tensor Network (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Yang, Fei Wang, Yusan Lin, Huiyuan Chen</p>
    <p>Fashion is more than Paris runways. Fashion is about how people express their interests, identity, mood, and cultural influences. Given an inventory of candidate garments from different categories, how to assemble them together would most improve their fashionability? This question presents an intriguing visual recommendation challenge to automatically create capsule wardrobes. Capsule wardrobe generation is a complex combinatorial problem that requires the understanding of how multiple visual items interact. The generative process often needs fashion experts to manually tease the combinations out, making it hard to scale.<br>We introduce TensorNet, an approach that captures the key ingredients of visual compatibility among tops, bottoms, and shoes. TensorNet aims to provide actionable advice for full-body clothing outfits that mix and match well. Our TensorNet consists of two core modules: a Cross-Attention Message Passing module and a Wide&Deep Tensor Interaction module. As such, TensorNet is able to characterize the local region-based patterns as well as the global compatibility of the entire outfits. Our experimental results on the real-word datasets indicate that the proposed method is capable of learning visual compatibility and outperforms all the baselines. TensorNet opens up opportunities for fashion designers to narrow down the search space for multi-clothes combinations.</p>
