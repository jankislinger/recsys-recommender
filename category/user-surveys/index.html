    <h3>Exploratory Analysis of Recommending Urban Parks for Health-Promoting Activities (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Quercia, Sanja Šćepanović, Ke Zhou, Linus W. Dietz</p>
    <p>Parks are essential spaces for promoting urban health, and recommender systems could assist individuals in discovering parks for leisure and health-promoting activities. This is particularly important in large cities like London, which has over 1,500 named parks, making it challenging to understand what each park offers. Due to the lack of datasets and the diverse health-promoting activities parks can support (e.g., physical, social, nature-appreciation), it is unclear which recommendation algorithms are best suited for this task. To explore the dynamics of recommending parks for specific activities, we created two datasets: one from a survey of over 250 London residents, and another by inferring visits from over 1 million geotagged Flickr images taken in London parks. Analyzing the geographic patterns of these visits revealed that recommending nearby parks is ineffective, suggesting that this recommendation task is distinct from Point of Interest recommendation. We then tested various recommendation models, identifying a significant popularity bias in the results. Additionally, we found that personalized models have advantages in recommending parks beyond the most popular ones. The data and findings from this study provide a foundation for future research on park recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Interpretable User Retention Modeling in Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leyu Lin, Xiaochun Yang, Ruobing Xie, Kaikai Ge, Xu Zhang, Xiaobo Hao, Jie Zhou, Rui Ding</p>
    <p>Recommendation usually focuses on immediate accuracy metrics like CTR as training objectives. User retention rate, which reflects the percentage of today’s users that will return to the recommender system in the next few days, should be paid more attention to in real-world systems. User retention is the most intuitive and accurate reflection of user long-term satisfaction. However, most existing recommender systems are not focused on user retention-related objectives, since their complexity and uncertainty make it extremely hard to discover why a user will or will not return to a system and which behaviors affect user retention. In this work, we conduct a series of preliminary explorations on discovering and making full use of the reasons for user retention in recommendation. Specifically, we make a first attempt to design a rationale contrastive multi-instance learning framework to explore the rationale and improve the interpretability of user retention. Extensive offline and online evaluations with detailed analyses of a real-world recommender system verify the effectiveness of our user retention modeling. We further reveal the real-world interpretable factors of user retention from both user surveys and explicit negative feedback quantitative analyses to facilitate future model designs.</p>

    <h3>A Multi-Stakeholder Recommender System for Rewards Recommendations (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Leontjeva, Thireindar Min, Luiz Pizzato, Naime Ranjbar Kermany, Callum Scott</p>
    <p>Australia’s largest bank, Commonwealth Bank (CBA) has a large data and analytics function that focuses on building a brighter future for all using data and decision science. In this work, we focus on creating better services for CBA customers by developing a next generation recommender system that brings the most relevant merchant reward offers that can help customers save money. Our recommender provides CBA cardholders with cashback offers from merchants, who have different objectives when they create offers. This work describes a multi-stakeholder, multi-objective problem in the context of CommBank Rewards (CBR) and describes how we developed a system that balances the objectives of the bank, its customers, and the many objectives from merchants into a single recommender system.</p>

    <h3>ImRec: Learning Reciprocal Preferences Using Images (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan McConville, James Neve</p>
    <p>Reciprocal Recommender Systems are recommender systems for social platforms that connect people to people. They are commonly used in online dating, social networks and recruitment services. The main difference between these and conventional user-item recommenders that might be found on, for example, a shopping service, is that they must consider the interests of both parties. In this study, we present a novel method of making reciprocal recommendations based on image data. Given a user’s history of positive and negative preference expressions on other users images, we train a siamese network to identify images that fit a user’s personal preferences. We provide an algorithm to interpret those individual preference indicators into a single reciprocal preference relation. Our evaluation was performed on a large real-world dataset provided by a popular online dating service. Based on this, our service significantly improves on previous state-of-the-art content-based solutions, and also out-performs collaborative filtering solutions in cold-start situations. The success of this model provides empirical evidence for the high importance of images in online dating.</p>

    <h3>ComfRide: A Smartphone based System for Comfortable Public Transport Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surjya Ghosh, Niloy Ganguly, Sandip Chakraborty, Bivas Mitra, Rohit Verma, Saketh Mahankali</p>
    <p>Passenger comfort is a major factor influencing a commuter’s decision to avail public transport. Existing studies suggest that factors like overcrowding, jerkiness, traffic congestion etc. correlate well to passenger’s (dis)comfort. An online survey conducted with more than 300 participants from 12 different countries reveals that different personalized and context dependent factors influence passenger comfort during a travel by public transport. Leveraging on these findings, we identify correlations between comfort level and these dynamic parameters, and implement a smartphone based application, ComfRide, which recommends the most comfortable route based on user’s preference honoring her travel time constraint. We use a ‘Dynamic Input/Output Automata’ based composition model to capture both the wide varieties of comfort choices from the commuters and the impact of environment on the comfort parameters. Evaluation of ComfRide, involving 50 participants over 28 routes in a state capital of India, reveals that recommended routes have on average 30% better comfort level than Google map recommended routes, when a commuter gives priority to specific comfort parameters of her choice.</p>

    <h3>Guided Walk: A Scalable Recommendation Algorithm for Complex Heterogeneous Social Networks (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uzi Cohen, Roy Levin, Hassan Abassi</p>
    <p>Online social networks have become predominant in recent years and have grown to encompass massive scales of data. In addition to data scale, these networks can be heterogeneous and contain complex structures between different users, between social entities and various interactions between users and social entities. This is especially true in enterprise social networks where hierarchies explicitly exist between employees as well. In such networks, producing the best recommendations for each user is a very challenging problem for two main reasons. First, the complex structures in the social network need to be properly mined and exploited by the algorithm. Second, these networks contain millions or even billions of edges making the problem very difficult computationally. In this paper we present Guided Walk, a supervised graph based algorithm that learns the significance of different network links for each user and then produces entity recommendations based on this learning phase. We compare the algorithm with a set of baseline algorithms using offline evaluation techniques as well as a user survey. The offline results show that the algorithm outperforms the next best algorithm by a factor of 3.6. The user survey further confirms that the recommendation are not only relevant but also rank high in terms of personal relevance for each user. To deal with large scale social networks, the Guided Walk algorithm is formulated as a Pregel program which allows us to utilize the power of distributed parallel computing. This would allow horizontally scaling the algorithm for larger social networks by simply adding more compute nodes to the cluster.</p>

    <h3>A Hybrid Explanations Framework for Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shay Ben Elazar, Noam Koenigstein</p>
    <p>Augmenting personalized recommendations with explanations is believed to improve users' trust, loyalty, satisfaction, and recommender's persuasiveness. We present a flexible explanations framework for collaborative filtering recom-mender systems. Our algorithms utilizes item tags to automatically generate personalized explanations in a natural language format. Given a specific user and a recommended item, the algorithm utilizes the user's personal information as well as global information (e.g., item similarities, metadata) in order to rank item tags based on their "explanatory power". The top tags are chosen to construct a personalized explanation sentence which helps shed light on the underlying recommender. Our system has been well received by both focus groups as well as in expert evaluations and is scheduled to be evaluated in an online experiment.</p>
