    <h3>One-class recommendation systems  with  the hinge pairwise distance loss and orthogonal representations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramin Raziperchikolaei, Young-joo Chung</p>
    <p>In one-class recommendation systems, the goal is to learn a model from a small set of interacted users and items and then identify the positively-related (i.e., similar) user-item pairs among a large number of pairs with unknown interactions. Most loss functions in the literature rely on dissimilar pairs of users and items, which are selected from the ones with unknown interactions, to obtain better prediction performance. The main issue of this strategy is that it needs a large number of dissimilar pairs, which increases the training time significantly. In this paper, the goal is to only use the similar set to train the models and discard the dissimilar set.  We highlight three trivial solutions that the models converge to when they are trained only on similar pairs: collapsed, dimensional collapsed, and shrinking solutions. We propose a hinge pairwise loss and an orthogonality term that can be added to the objective functions in the literature to avoid these trivial solutions. We conduct experiments on various tasks on public and real-world datasets, which show that our approach using only similar pairs can be trained several times faster than the state-of-the-art methods while achieving competitive results.</p>

    <h3>Uncertainty-adjusted Inductive Matrix Completion with Graph Neural Networks (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Ledent, Petr Kasalicky, Rodrigo Alves</p>
    <p>We propose a robust recommender systems model which performs matrix completion and a ratings-wise uncertainty estimation jointly. Whilst the prediction module is purely based on an implicit low-rank assumption imposed via nuclear norm regularization, our loss function is augmented by an uncertainty estimation module which learns an anomaly score for each individual rating via a Graph Neural Network: data points deemed more anomalous by the GNN are downregulated in the loss function used to train the low-rank module. The whole model is trained in an end-to-end fashion, allowing the anomaly detection module to tap on the supervised information available in the form of ratings. Thus, our model’s predictors enjoy the favourable generalization properties that come with being chosen from small function space (i.e., low-rank matrices), whilst exhibiting the robustness to outliers and flexibility that comes with deep learning methods. Furthermore, the anomaly scores themselves contain valuable qualitative information. Experiments on various real-life datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms standard matrix completion and other baselines, confirming the usefulness of the anomaly detection module.</p>
