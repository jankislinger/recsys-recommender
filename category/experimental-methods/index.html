    <h3>Δ-OPE: Off-Policy Estimation with Pairs of Policies (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksei Ustimenko, Olivier Jeunen</p>
    <p>The off-policy paradigm casts recommendation as a counterfactual decision-making task, allowing practitioners to unbiasedly estimate online metrics using offline data. This leads to effective evaluation metrics, as well as learning procedures that directly optimise online success. Nevertheless, the high variance that comes with unbiased- ness is typically the crux that complicates practical applications. An important insight is that the difference between policy values can often be estimated with significantly reduced variance, if said policies have positive covariance. This allows us to formulate a pairwise off-policy estimation task: Δ-OPE. Δ-OPE subsumes the common use-case of estimating improve- ments of a learnt policy over a production policy, using data col- lected by a stochastic logging policy. We introduce Δ-OPE methods based on the widely used Inverse Propensity Scoring estimator and its extensions. Moreover, we characterise a variance-optimal additive control variate that further enhances efficiency. Simulated, offline, and online experiments show that our methods significantly improve performance for both evaluation and learning tasks.</p>

    <h3>An Audit of Misinformation Filter Bubbles on YouTube: Bubble Bursting and Recent Behavior Changes (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Moro, Elena Stefancova, Branislav Pecher, Michal Kompan, Andrea Hrckova, Matus Tomlein, Ivan Srba, Juraj Podrouzek, Jakub Simko, Maria Bielikova</p>
    <p>The negative effects of misinformation filter bubbles in adaptive systems have been known to researchers for some time. Several studies investigated, most prominently on YouTube, how fast a user can get into a misinformation filter bubble simply by selecting “wrong choices” from the items offered. Yet, no studies so far have investigated what it takes to “burst the bubble”, i.e., revert the bubble enclosure. We present a study in which pre-programmed agents (acting as YouTube users) delve into misinformation filter bubbles by watching misinformation promoting content (for various topics). Then, by watching misinformation debunking content, the agents try to burst the bubbles and reach more balanced recommendation mixes. We recorded the search results and recommendations, which the agents encountered, and analyzed them for the presence of misinformation. Our key finding is that bursting of a filter bubble is possible, albeit it manifests differently from topic to topic. Moreover, we observe that filter bubbles do not truly appear in some situations. We also draw a direct comparison with a previous study. Sadly, we did not find much improvements in misinformation occurrences, despite recent pledges by YouTube.</p>

    <h3>Biases in Recommendation System (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saumya Bhadani</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems shape what people consume and experience online, which makes it critical to assess their effect on society and whether they are affected by any potential source of bias. My research focuses on a specific source of bias — popularity — that is especially relevant in two online contexts: news consumption, and cultural markets. Social media newsfeeds, which are designed to optimize the engagement of users, may inadvertently promote inaccurate and partisan news domains, since these are often popular among like-minded and polarized audiences. More generally, in any type of cultural market, popularity bias may lead to the suppression of niche quality products, which may not attract enough attention. In the context of online newsfeeds, I am investigating whether the political diversity of the audience of a news website can be used as signal of journalistic quality. In an analysis of a comprehensive dataset of news source reliability ratings and web browsing histories, I have shown that the diversity of the audience of a news website is a valuable signal to counter popularity bias and to promote journalistic quality. To further validate these results experimentally, I propose to have direct interactions with social media users through surveys. Here, I provide the details of a field study that I am planning to undertake using an experimental social media platform. More generally, in the context of any online cultural market, political audience diversity may not be applicable but the idea of diversity as a signal for higher quality might still be useful. For example, movies which are liked by an “age diverse” population or books which are read by racially diverse audience may have better quality than other items. However, in this research I have explored audience diversity in the context of social media newsfeeds only. For any online cultural market, I propose a method to quantify the popularity bias through an empirical analysis, using data from several existing markets. Accurately estimating the impact of popularity bias can help us advance our understanding of machine biases and also lead to the development of more robust recommendation systems.</p>

    <h3>Intent-Aware Diversification using Item-Based SubProfiles (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mesut Kaya, Derek Bridge</p>
    <p>In many approaches to recommendation diversification, a recommender scores items for relevance and then re-ranks them to balance relevance with diversity. In intent-aware diversification, diversity is formulated in terms of coverage of aspects, where aspects are either explicit such as movie genres or implicit such as the latent factors found during matrix factorization. Typically, the same set of aspects is used across all users. In this paper, we propose a form of personalized intent-aware diversification, which we call SPAD (SubProfile-Aware Diversification). The aspects we use in SPAD are subprofiles of the user’s profile. They are not defined in terms of explicit or implicit features. We compare SPAD to other forms of intent-aware diversification. We present empirical results in support of SPAD.</p>

    <h3>E-commerce Recommendation with Personalized Promotion (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fangfang Tan, Daniel Friedman, Yi Zhang, Qi Zhao</p>
    <p>Most existing e-commerce recommender systems aim to recommend the right products to a consumer, assuming the properties of each product are fixed. However, some properties, including price discount, can be personalized to respond to each consumer’s preference. This paper studies how to automatically set the price discount when recommending a product, in light of the fact that the price often will alter a consumer’s purchase decision. The key to optimizing the discount is to predict consumer’s willingness-to-pay (WTP), namely, the highest price a consumer is willing to pay for a product. Purchase data used by traditional e-commerce recommender systems provide points below or above the decision boundary. In this paper we collected training data to better predict the decision boundary. We implement a new e-commerce mechanism adapted from laboratory lottery and auction experiments that elicit a rational customer’s exact WTP for a small subset of products, and use a machine learning algorithm to predict the customer’s WTP for other products. The mechanism is implemented on our own e-commerce website that leverages Amazon’s data and subjects recruited via Mechanical Turk. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can better predict WTP, dramatically improve conversion rate and sales revenue.</p>

    <h3>Do you have a Pop face? Here is a Pop song. Using profile pictures to mitigate the cold-start problem in Music Recommender Systems. (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugenio Tacchini, Ramon Morros, Enrique Sañoso, Veronica Vilaplana</p>
    <p>When a new user registers to a recommender system service, the system does not know her taste and cannot propose meaningful suggestions (cold-start problem). This preliminary work attempts to mitigate the cold-start problem using the profile picture of the user as a sole information, following the intuition that a correspondence may exist between the pictures that people use to represent themselves and their taste. We proved that, at least in the small music community we used for our experiments, our method can improve the precision of both a classifier and a Top-N music recommender system in a cold-start condition.</p>

    <h3>Recommending Learning Materials to Students by Identifying their Knowledge Gaps (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Tuzhilin, Konstantin Bauman</p>
    <p>We propose a new content-based method of providing recommendations of educational materials to the students by identifying gaps in their knowledge of the subject matter in the courses they take. We experimentally validate our method by conducting an A/B test on the students from an online university.</p>
