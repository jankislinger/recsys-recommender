    <h3>Ghosting: Contextualized Inline Query Completion in Large Scale Retail Search (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uma Murthy, Lakshmi Ramachandran</p>
    <p>Query auto-completion presents a ranked list of queries as suggestions for a user-entered prefix. Ghosting is the process of auto-completing a search recommendation by highlighting the suggested text inline within the search box. We propose the use of a behavior-based recommendation model along with customer search context to ghost on high-confidence queries. We tested ghosting on a retail production system, on over 140 million search sessions. We found that session-context based ghosting significantly increased the acceptance of offered suggestions by 6.18%, reduced misspellings among searches by 4.42%, and improved net sales by 0.14%.</p>

    <h3>E-commerce Recommendation with Personalized Promotion (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fangfang Tan, Daniel Friedman, Yi Zhang, Qi Zhao</p>
    <p>Most existing e-commerce recommender systems aim to recommend the right products to a consumer, assuming the properties of each product are fixed. However, some properties, including price discount, can be personalized to respond to each consumer’s preference. This paper studies how to automatically set the price discount when recommending a product, in light of the fact that the price often will alter a consumer’s purchase decision. The key to optimizing the discount is to predict consumer’s willingness-to-pay (WTP), namely, the highest price a consumer is willing to pay for a product. Purchase data used by traditional e-commerce recommender systems provide points below or above the decision boundary. In this paper we collected training data to better predict the decision boundary. We implement a new e-commerce mechanism adapted from laboratory lottery and auction experiments that elicit a rational customer’s exact WTP for a small subset of products, and use a machine learning algorithm to predict the customer’s WTP for other products. The mechanism is implemented on our own e-commerce website that leverages Amazon’s data and subjects recruited via Mechanical Turk. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can better predict WTP, dramatically improve conversion rate and sales revenue.</p>

    <h3>Recommender Systems for Product Bundling (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lior Rokach, Moran Beladev, Bracha Shapira</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RSs) enhance e-commerce sales by recommending relevant products to their customers. RSs aim at implementing the firm’s web-based marketing strategy to increase revenues. Generating bundles is an example of a marketing strategy that aims to satisfy consumer needs and preferences, and at the same time, to increase customers’ buying scope and the firm’s income. Thus, finding and recommending an optimal and personal bundle becomes very important. In this paper we introduce a novel model of bundle recommendations that integrates collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, personalized demand functions, and price modeling. This model provides a recommendation list by finding pairs of products that maximizes both, the probability of their purchase by the user and the revenue received by selling this bundles.</p>
