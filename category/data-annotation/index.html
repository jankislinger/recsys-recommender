    <h3>Is It Really Complementary? Revisiting Behavior-based Labels for Complementary Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazushi Okamoto, Kai Sugahara, Chihiro Yamasaki</p>
    <p>Complementary recommendation is a type of item-to-item recommendation that recommends what should be purchased together for an item. Previous studies have traditionally used behavior-based labels (BBLs) that are constructed from the co-purchase logs of users for training and evaluation because rigorous label construction for complements is inefficient. However, the fact that many item pairs in BBLs are not functionally complementary, even though they are frequently co-purchased, has been overlooked. This study aimed to re-evaluate the validity of BBLs through functional relationships and provide directions for their improvement. Quantitative analysis using manually annotated function-based labels (FBLs) as correct labels revealed that the accuracy of the complementary recommendations generated by BBLs was below 50%, suggesting potential functional incompatibility within BBLs. Existing models that were trained on BBLs were similarly inaccurate, indicating the unreliability of the evaluations in existing studies. Finally, we proposed a label correction method for BBLs using a small set of FBLs, thereby providing a direction for reliable complementary recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Soliciting User Preferences in Conversational Recommender Systems via Usage-related Questions (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivica Kostric, Filip Radlinski, Krisztian Balog</p>
    <p>A key distinguishing feature of conversational recommender systems over traditional recommender systems is their ability to elicit user preferences using natural language. Currently, the predominant approach to preference elicitation is to ask questions directly about items or item attributes. These strategies do not perform well in cases where the user does not have sufficient knowledge of the target domain to answer such questions. Conversely, in a shopping setting, talking about the planned use of items does not present any difficulties, even for those that are new to a domain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to preference elicitation by asking implicit questions based on item usage. Our approach consists of two main steps. First, we identify the sentences from a large review corpus that contain information about item usage. Then, we generate implicit preference elicitation questions from those sentences using a neural text-to-text model. The main contributions of this work also include a multi-stage data annotation protocol using crowdsourcing for collecting high-quality labeled training data for the neural model. We show that out approach is effective in selecting review sentences and transforming them to elicitation questions, even with limited training data.</p>
