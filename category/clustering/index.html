    <h3>A Multi-modal Modeling Framework for Cold-start Short-video Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Gai, Han Li, Ruina Sun, Jingjian Lin, Xinghua Zhang, Gaode Chen, Qi Zhang, Jiangxia Cao, Yuezihan Jiang</p>
    <p>Short video has witnessed rapid growth in the past few years in multimedia platforms. To ensure the freshness of the videos, platforms receive a large number of user-uploaded videos every day, making collaborative filtering-based recommender methods suffer from the item cold-start problem (e.g., the new-coming videos are difficult to compete with existing videos). Consequently, increasing efforts tackle the cold-start issue from the content perspective, focusing on modeling the multi-modal preferences of users, a fair way to compete with new-coming and existing videos. However, recent studies ignore the existing gap between multi-modal embedding extraction and user interest modeling as well as the discrepant intensities of user preferences for different modalities. In this paper, we propose M3CSR, a multi-modal modeling framework for cold-start short video recommendation. Specifically, we preprocess content-oriented multi-modal features for items and obtain trainable category IDs by performing clustering. In each modality, we combine modality-specific cluster ID embedding and the mapped original modality feature as modality-specific representation of the item to address the gap. Meanwhile, M3CSR measures the user modality-specific intensity based on the correlation between modality-specific interest and behavioral interest and employs pairwise loss to further decouple user multi-modal interests. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model. The framework has been deployed on a billion-user scale short video application and has shown improvements in various commercial metrics within cold-start scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Automatic Collection Creation and Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manjeet Dahiya, Piyush Singh, Sanidhya Singal</p>
    <p>We present a collection recommender system that can automatically create and recommend collections of items at a user level. Unlike regular recommender systems, which output top-N relevant items, a collection recommender system outputs collections of items such that the items in the collections are relevant to a user, and the items within a collection follow a specific theme. Our system builds on top of the user-item representations learnt by item recommender systems. We employ dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques along with intuitive heuristics to create collections with their ratings and titles. We test these ideas in a real-world setting of music recommendation, within a popular music streaming service. We find that there is a 2.3x increase in recommendation-driven consumption when recommending collections over items. Further, it results in effective utilization of real estate and leads to recommending a more and diverse set of items. To our knowledge, these are first of its kind experiments at such a large scale.</p>

    <h3>ClusterExplorer: Enable User Control over Related Recommendations via Collaborative Filtering and Clustering (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kati Launis, Denis Kotkov, Mats Neovius, Qian Zhao</p>
    <p>Related item recommendations have a long history in recommender systems, but they tend to be a static list of similar items with respect to a target item of interest without any support of user control. In this paper, we propose ClusterExplorer, a novel approach for enabling user control over related recommendations. The approach allows users to explore the latent space of user-item interactions through controlling related recommendations. We evaluated ClusterExplorer in the book domain with 42 participants recruited in a public library and found that our approach has higher user satisfaction of browsing items and is more helpful in finding interesting items compared to traditional related item recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Exploring Clustering of Bandits for Online Recommendation System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Xia, Qiang Yang, Bo Liu, Kai Chen, Leyu Lin, Liu Yang</p>
    <p>Cluster-of-bandit policy leverages contextual bandits in a collaborative filtering manner and aids personalized services in the online recommendation system (RecSys). When facing insufficient observations, the cluster-of-bandit policy could achieve more outstanding performance because of knowledge sharing. Cluster-of-bandit policy aims to maximize the cumulative feedback, e.g., clicks, from users. Nevertheless, in the way of their goal exist two kinds of uncertainties. First, cluster-of-bandit algorithms make recommendations according to their uncertain estimation of user interests. Second, cluster-of-bandit algorithms transfer relevant knowledge upon uncertain and noisy user clusters. Existing algorithms only consider the first one, while leaving the latter one untouched. To address the two challenges together, in this paper, we propose the ClexB policy for online RecSys. On the one hand, ClexB estimates user clustering more accurately and with less uncertainty via explorable-clustering. On the other hand, ClexB also exploits and explores user interests by sharing information within and among user clusters. In summary, ClexB explores knowledge transfer and further aids the inferences about user interests. Besides, we provide extensive empirical experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets and regret analysis, further consolidating the superiority of ClexB.</p>

    <h3>A Joint Dynamic Ranking System with DNN and Vector-based Clustering Bandit (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changping Peng, Jincheng Wang, Xiaoxiao Xu, Weipeng Yan, Yong Li, Yongjun Bao, Yu Liu</p>
    <p>The ad-ranking module is the core of the advertising recommender system. Existing ad-ranking modules are mainly based on the deep neural network click-through rate prediction model. Recently an innovative ad-ranking paradigm called DNN-MAB has been introduced to address DNN-only paradigms’ weakness in perceiving highly dynamic user intent over time. We introduce the DNN-MAB paradigm into our ad-ranking system to alleviate the Matthew effect that harms the user experience. Due to data sparsity, however, the actual performance of DNN-MAB is lower than expected. In this paper, we propose an innovative ad-ranking paradigm called DNN-VMAB to solve these problems. Based on vectorization and clustering, it utilizes latent collaborative information in user behavior data to find a set of ads with higher relativity and diversity. As an integration of the essences of classical collaborative filtering, deep click-through rate prediction model, and contextual multi-armed bandit, it can improve platform revenue and user experience. Both offline and online experiments show the advantage of our new algorithm over DNN-MAB and some other existing algorithms.</p>

    <h3>Learning Within-Session Budgets from Browsing Trajectories for Item Recommendations (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Louca, Julian McAuley, Liangjie Hong, Diane Hu</p>
    <p>Building price- and budget-aware recommender systems is critical in settings where one wishes to produce recommendations that balance users’ preferences (what they like) with a model of purchase likelihood (what they will buy). A trivial solution consists of learning global budget terms for each user based on their past expenditure. To more accurately model user budgets, we also consider a user’s within-session budget, which may deviate from their global budget depending on their shopping context. In this paper, we find that users implicitly reveal their session-specific budgets through the sequence of items they browse within that session. Specifically, we find that some users browse down, by purchasing the cheapest item among alternatives under consideration, others browse up(selecting the most expensive), and others ultimately purchase items around the middle. Surprisingly, this mixture of behaviors is difficult to observe globally, but individual users tend to belong firmly to one of the three segments. To model this behavior, we develop an interpretable budget model that combines a clustering component to detect different user segments, with a model of segment-specific purchase profiles. We apply our model on a production dataset of browsing and purchasing sessions from a large e-commerce website focused on handmade and vintage goods, where it outperforms strong baselines and existing production systems.</p>

    <h3>Using Taste Groups for Collaborative Filtering (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nevin L. Zhang, Farhan Khawar</p>
    <p>Implicit feedback is the simplest form of user feedback that can be used for item recommendation. It is easy to collect and domain independent. However, there is a lack of negative examples. Existing works circumvent this problem by making various assumptions regarding the unconsumed items, which fail to hold when the user did not consume an item because she was unaware of it. In this paper, we propose as a novel method for addressing the lack of negative examples in implicit feedback. The motivation is that if there is a large group of users who share the same taste and none of them consumed an item, then it is highly likely that the item is irrelevant to this taste. We use Hierarchical Latent Tree Analysis(HLTA) to identify taste-based user groups and make recommendations for a user based on her memberships in the groups.</p>

    <h3>User Segmentation for Controlling Recommendation Diversity (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farzad Eskandanian, Bamshad Mobasher, Robin Burke</p>
    <p>The quality of recommendations is known to be affected by diversity and novelty in addition to accuracy. Recent work has focused on methods that increase diversity of recommendation lists. However, these methods assume the user preference for diversity is constant across all users. In this paper, we show that users’ propensity towards diversity varies greatly and argue that the diversity of recommendation lists should be consistent with the level of user interest in diverse recommendations. We introduce a user segmentation approach in order to personalize recommendation according to user preference for diversity. We show that recommendations generated using these segments match the diversity preferences of users in each segment. We also discuss the impact of this segmentation on the novelty of recommendations.</p>
