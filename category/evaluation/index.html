    <h3>Looks Can Be Deceiving: Linking User-Item Interactions and User’s Propensity Towards Multi-Objective Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Boratto, Patrik Dokoupil, Ladislav Peska</p>
    <p>Multi-objective recommender systems (MORS) provide suggestions to users according to multiple (and possibly conflicting) goals. When a system optimizes its results at the individual-user level, it tailors them on a user’s propensity towards the different objectives. Hence, the capability to understand users’ fine-grained needs towards each goal is crucial. In this paper, we present the results of a user study in which we monitored the way users interacted with recommended items, as well as their self-proclaimed propensities towards relevance, novelty and diversity objectives. The study was divided into several sessions, where users evaluated recommendation lists originating from a relevance-only single-objective baseline as well as MORS. We show that despite MORS-based recommendations attracted less selections, its presence in the early sessions is crucial for users’ satisfaction in the later stages. Surprisingly, the self-proclaimed willingness of users to interact with novel and diverse items is not always reflected in the recommendations they accept. Post-study questionnaires provide insights on how to deal with this matter, suggesting that MORS-based results should be accompanied by elements that allow users to understand the recommendations, so as to facilitate their acceptance.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Negative Preference in Content-based Music Recommendation with Contrastive Learning (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minju Park, Kyogu Lee</p>
    <p>Advanced music recommendation systems are being introduced along with the development of machine learning. However, it is essential to design a music recommendation system that can increase user satisfaction by understanding users’ music tastes, not by the complexity of models. Although several studies related to music recommendation systems exploiting negative preferences have shown performance improvements, there was a lack of explanation on how they led to better recommendations. In this work, we analyze the role of negative preference in users’ music tastes by comparing music recommendation models with contrastive learning exploiting preference (CLEP) but with three different training strategies - exploiting preferences of both positive and negative (CLEP-PN), positive only (CLEP-P), and negative only (CLEP-N). We evaluate the effectiveness of the negative preference by validating each system with a small amount of personalized data obtained via survey and further illuminate the possibility of exploiting negative preference in music recommendations. Our experimental results show that CLEP-N outperforms the other two in accuracy and false positive rate. Furthermore, the proposed training strategies produced a consistent tendency regardless of different types of front-end musical feature extractors, proving the stability of the proposed method.</p>

    <h3>Enhancing Counterfactual Evaluation and Learning for Recommendation Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolò Felicioni</p>
    <p>Evaluating recommendation systems is a task of utmost importance and a very active research field. While online evaluation is the most reliable evaluation procedure, it may also be too expensive to perform, if not unfeasible. Therefore, researchers and practitioners resort to offline evaluation. Offline evaluation is much more efficient and scalable, but traditional approaches suffer from high bias. This issue led to the increased popularity of counterfactual techniques. These techniques are used for evaluation and learning in recommender systems and reduce the bias in offline evaluation. While counterfactual approaches have a solid statistical basis, their application to recommendation systems is still in a preliminary research phase. In this paper, we identify some limitations of counterfactual techniques applied to recommender systems, and we propose possible ways to overcome them.</p>

    <h3>Transfer Learning in Collaborative Recommendation for Bias Reduction (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weike Pan, Dugang Liu, Zinan Lin, Zhong Ming</p>
    <p>In a recommender system, a user’s interaction is often biased by the items’ displaying positions and popularity, as well as the user’s self-selection. Most existing recommendation models are built using such a biased user-system interaction data. In this paper, we first additionally introduce a specially collected unbiased data and then propose a novel transfer learning solution, i.e., transfer via joint reconstruction (TJR), to achieve knowledge transfer and sharing between the biased data and unbiased data. Specifically, in our TJR, we refine the prediction via the latent features containing bias information in order to obtain a more accurate and unbiased prediction. Moreover, we integrate the two data by reconstructing their interaction in a joint learning manner. We then adopt three representative methods as the backbone models of our TJR and conduct extensive empirical studies on two public datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of our transfer learning solution over some very competitive baselines.</p>

    <h3>BERT, ELMo, USE and InferSent Sentence Encoders: The Panacea for Research-Paper Recommendation? (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Micarelli, Giuseppe Sansonetti, Joeran Beel, Fabio Gasparetti, Hebatallah A. Mohamed Hassan</p>
    <p>Content-based approaches to research paper recommendation are important when user feedback is sparse or not available. The task of content-based matching is challenging, mainly due to the problem of determining the semantic similarity of texts. Nowadays, there exist many sentence embedding models that learn deep semantic representations by being trained on huge corpora, aiming to provide transfer learning to a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. In this work, we present a comparative evaluation among five well-known pre-trained sentence encoders deployed in the pipeline of title-based research paper recommendation. The experimented encoders are USE, BERT, InferSent, ELMo, and SciBERT. For our study, we propose a methodology for evaluating such models in reranking BM25-based recommendations. The experimental results show that the sole consideration of semantic information from these encoders does not lead to improved recommendation performance over the traditional BM25 technique, while their integration enables the retrieval of a set of relevant papers that may not be retrieved by the BM25 ranking function.</p>

    <h3>A Field Study of Related Video Recommendations: Newest, Most Similar, or Most Relevant (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Maxwell Harper, Yifan Zhong, Qian Zhao, Vikas Kumar, Tahir Lazaro Sousa Menezes</p>
    <p>Many video sites recommend videos related to the one a user is watching. These recommendations have been shown to influence what users end up exploring and are an important part of a recommender system. Plenty of methods have been proposed to recommend related videos, but there has been relatively little work that compares competing strategies. We describe a field study of related video recommendations, where we deploy algorithms to recommend related videos in a movie trailer viewing interface. Our results show that non-personalized algorithms yield the highest click-through rates, while the algorithm prioritizing recency is the strongest in leading to trailer-level user engagement. Our findings suggest the potential to design non-personalized yet effective related item recommendation strategies.</p>

    <h3>Securing Tag-based recommender systems against profile injection attacks: A comparative study (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heri Ramampiaro, Helge Langseth, Georgios Pitsilis</p>
    <p>This work addresses challenges related to attacks on social tagging systems, which often comes in a form of malicious annotations or profile injection attacks. In particular, we study various countermeasures against two types of threats for such systems, the Overload and the Piggyback attacks. The studied countermeasures include baseline classifiers such as, Naive Bayes filter and Support Vector Machine, as well as a deep learning-based approach. Our evaluation performed over synthetic spam data, generated from del.icio.us, shows that in most cases, the deep learning-based approach provides the best protection against threats.</p>

    <h3>Trust based Collaborative Filtering: Tackling the Cold Start Problem Using Regular Equivalence (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomislav Duricic, Emanuel Lacic, Elisabeth Lex, Dominik Kowald</p>
    <p>User-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most popular approaches to create recommender systems. This approach is based on finding the most relevant k users from whose rating history we can extract items to recommend. CF, however, suffers from data sparsity and the cold-start problem since users often rate only a small fraction of available items. One solution is to incorporate additional information into the recommendation process such as explicit trust scores that are assigned by users to others or implicit trust relationships that result from social connections between users. Such relationships typically form a very sparse trust network, which can be utilized to generate recommendations for users based on people they trust. In our work, we explore the use of a measure from network science, i.e. regular equivalence, applied to a trust network to generate a similarity matrix that is used to select the k-nearest neighbors for recommending items. We evaluate our approach on Epinions and we find that we can outperform related methods for tackling cold-start users in terms of recommendation accuracy.</p>

    <h3>Effective User Interface Designs to Increase Energy-efficient Behavior in a Rasch-based Energy Recommender System (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alain Starke, Chris Snijders, Martijn Willemsen</p>
    <p>People often struggle to find appropriate energy-saving measures to take in the household. Although recommender studies show that tailoring a system’s interaction method to the domain knowledge of the user can increase energy savings, they did not actually tailor the conservation advice itself. We present two large user studies in which we support users to make an energy-efficient behavioral change by presenting tailored energy-saving advice. Both systems use a one-dimensional, ordinal Rasch scale, which orders 79 energy-saving measures on their behavioral difficulty and link this to a user’s energy-saving ability for tailored advice. We established that recommending Rasch-based advice can reduce a user’s effort, increase system support and, in turn, increase choice satisfaction and lead to the adoption of more energy-saving measures. Moreover, follow-up surveys four weeks later point out that tailoring advice on its feasibility can lead to behavioral change.</p>

    <h3>Idomaar: A Framework for Multi-dimensional Benchmarking of Recommender Algorithms (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andras Sereny, Davide Malagoli, Till Plumbaum, Andreas Lommatzsch, Benjamin Kille, Martha Larson, Frank Hopfgartner, Mario Scriminaci</p>
    <p>In real-world scenarios, recommenders face non-functional requirements of technical nature and must handle dynamic data in the form of sequential streams. Evaluation of recommender systems must take these issues into account in order to be maximally informative. In this paper, we present a framework called Idomaar which enables the efficient multi-dimensional benchmarking of recommender algorithms. Idomaar goes beyond current academic research practices by creating a realistic evaluation environment and computing both effectiveness and technical metrics for stream-based as well as set based evaluation. The potentials of the framework are illustrated in a scenario that focuses on the “research to prototyping to productization” cycle at a company. We show that Idomaar simplifies the testing with different configurations and supports the flexible integration of different data.</p>

    <h3>Music Playlist Recommendation via Preference Embedding (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chih-Chun Hsia, Ming-Feng Tsai, Yian Chen, Chih-Ming Chen, Chun-Yao Yang</p>
    <p>Music playlists usually contain some particular musical styles or atmospheres in which users would like to be involved. Music streaming services, such as Spotify, Apple Music, and KKBOX, even allow users to edit and listen to playlists online. While it has been some well-known methods that can nicely model the preference between users and songs, little has been done in the literature to recommend music playlists, each of which can be considered as a set of many individual songs, to users. In the light of this, this paper proposes a preference embedding based on a user-song-playlist graph to learn the preference representations of these three entities. After the embedding process, we then use the learned representations to perform the task of playlist recommendation. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset show that the proposed embedding method outperforms the baseline of popularity; in addition, we also make a comparison with DeepWalk and LINE for the recommendation task, and the results show that the proposed method can stand comparison with the two state-of-the-art graph embedding techniques.</p>

    <h3>Intent-Aware Diversification Using a Constrained PLSA (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacek Wasilewski, Neil Hurley</p>
    <p>The intent-aware diversification framework was introduced initially in information retrieval and adopted to the context of recommender systems in the work of Vargas et al. The framework considers a set of aspects associated with items to be recommended. For instance, aspects may correspond to genres in movie recommendations. The framework depends on input aspect model consisting of item selection or relevance probabilities, given an aspect, and user intents, in the form of probabilities that the user is interested in each aspect. In this paper, we examine a number of input aspect models and evaluate the impact that different models have on the framework. In particular, we propose a constrained PLSA model that allows for interpretable output, in terms of known aspects, while achieving greater performance that the explicit co-occurrence counting method used in previous work. We evaluate the proposed models using a well-known MovieLens dataset for which item genres are available.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Poisson Factorization (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David M. Blei, Laurent Charlin, James McInerney, Rajesh Ranganath</p>
    <p>Models for recommender systems use latent factors to explain the preferences and behaviors of users with respect to a set of items (e.g., movies, books, academic papers). Typically, the latent factors are assumed to be static and, given these factors, the observed preferences and behaviors of users are assumed to be generated without order. These assumptions limit the explorative and predictive capabilities of such models, since users’ interests and item popularity may evolve over time. To address this, we propose dPF, a dynamic matrix factorization model based on the recent Poisson factorization model for recommendations. dPF models the time evolving latent factors with a Kalman filter and the actions with Poisson distributions. We derive a scalable variational inference algorithm to infer the latent factors. Finally, we demonstrate dPF on 10 years of user click data from arXiv.org, one of the largest repository of scientific papers and a formidable source of information about the behavior of scientists. Empirically we show performance improvement over both static and, more recently proposed, dynamic recommendation models. We also provide a thorough exploration of the inferred posteriors over the latent variables.</p>

    <h3>Incremental Matrix Factorization via Feature Space Re-learning for Recommender System (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian Cheng, Hanqing Lu, Qiang Song</p>
    <p>Matrix factorization is widely used in Recommender Systems. Although existing popular incremental matrix factorization methods are effectively in reducing time complexity, they simply assume that the similarity between items or users is invariant. For instance, they keep the item feature matrix unchanged and just update the user matrix without re-training the entire model. However, with the new users growing continuously, the fitting error would be accumulated since the extra distribution information of items has not been utilized. In this paper, we present an alternative and reasonable approach, with a relaxed assumption that the similarity between items (users) is relatively stable after updating. Concretely, utilizing the prediction error of the new data as the auxiliary features, our method updates both feature matrices simultaneously, and thus users’ preference can be better modeled than merely adjusting one corresponded feature matrix. Besides, our method maintains the feature dimension in a smaller size through taking advantage of matrix sketching. Experimental results show that our proposal outperforms the existing incremental matrix factorization methods.</p>
