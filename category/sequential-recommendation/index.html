    <h3>Dynamic Stage-aware User Interest Learning for Heterogeneous Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhong Ming, Weixin Li, Xiaolin Lin, Weike Pan</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation has been widely used to predict users’ potential preferences by learning their dynamic user interests, for which most previous works focus on capturing item-level dependencies. Despite the great success, they often overlook the stage-level interest dependencies. In real-world scenarios, user interests tend to be staged, e.g., following an item purchase, a user’s interests may undergo a transition into the subsequent phase. And there are intricate dependencies across different stages. Meanwhile, users’ behaviors are usually heterogeneous, including auxiliary behaviors (e.g., examinations) and target behaviors (e.g., purchases), which imply more fine-grained user interests. However, existing works have limitations in explicitly modeling the relationships between auxiliary behaviors and target behaviors. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework, i.e., dynamic stage-aware user interest learning (DSUIL), for heterogeneous sequential recommendation, which is the first solution to model user interests in a cross-stage manner. Specifically, our DSUIL consists of three modules: a dynamic graph convolution module that dynamically learns item representations in each stage, a behavior-aware subgraph representation learning module that learns heterogeneous dependencies between behaviors and aggregates item representations to represent the user interests for each stage, and a sequence decoder to capture the evolving pattern of user interests and make item prediction. Extensive experimental results on two public datasets show that our DSUIL performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>Learning Personalized Health Recommendations via Offline Reinforcement Learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Larry Preuett</p>
    <p>The healthcare industry is strained and would benefit from personalized treatment plans for treating various health conditions (e.g., HIV and diabetes). Reinforcement Learning is a promising approach to learning such sequential recommendation systems. However, applying reinforcement learning in the medical domain is challenging due to the lack of adequate evaluation metrics, partial observability, and the inability to explore due to safety concerns. In this line of work, we identify three research directions to improve the applicability of treatment plans learned using offline reinforcement learning.</p>

    <h3>A Pre-trained Zero-shot Sequential Recommendation Framework via Popularity Dynamics (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hari Sundaram, Junting Wang, Praneet Rathi</p>
    <p>This paper proposes a novel pre-trained framework for zero-shot cross-domain  sequential recommendation without auxiliary information. While using auxiliary information (e.g., item descriptions) seems promising for cross-domain transfer, a cross-domain adaptation of sequential recommenders can be challenging when the target domain differs from the source domain—item descriptions are in different languages; metadata modalities (e.g., audio, image, and text) differ across source and target domains. If we can learn universal item representations independent of the domain type (e.g., groceries, movies), we can achieve zero-shot cross-domain transfer without auxiliary information. Our critical insight is that user interaction sequences highlight shifting user preferences via the popularity dynamics of interacted items. We present a pre-trained sequential recommendation framework: PrepRec, which utilizes a novel popularity dynamics-aware transformer architecture. Through extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, we show that PrepRec, without any auxiliary information, can zero-shot adapt to new application domains and achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art sequential recommender models. In addition, we show that PrepRec complements existing sequential recommenders. With a simple post-hoc interpolation, PrepRec improves the performance of existing sequential recommenders on average by 11.8% in Recall@10 and 22% in NDCG@10. We provide an anonymized implementation of PrepRec at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PrepRec–128E/}.</p>

    <h3>The Elephant in the Room: Rethinking the Usage of Pre-trained Language Model in Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zekai Qu, Chaojun Xiao, Zhanhui Kang, Ruobing Xie, Xingwu Sun</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation (SR) has seen significant advancements with the help of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Some PLM-based SR models directly use PLM to encode user historical behavior’s text sequences to learn user representations, while there is seldom an in-depth exploration of the capability and suitability of PLM in behavior sequence modeling. In this work, we first conduct extensive model analyses between PLMs and PLM-based SR models, discovering great underutilization and parameter redundancy of PLMs in behavior sequence modeling. Inspired by this, we explore different lightweight usages of PLMs in SR, aiming to maximally stimulate the ability of PLMs for SR while satisfying the efficiency and usability demands of practical systems. We discover that adopting behavior-tuned PLMs for item initializations of conventional ID-based SR models is the most economical framework of PLM-based SR, which would not bring in any additional inference cost but could achieve a dramatic performance boost compared with the original version. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that our simple and universal framework leads to significant improvement compared to classical SR and SOTA PLM-based SR models without additional inference costs.</p>

    <h3>Efficient Inference of Sub-Item Id-based Sequential Recommendation Models with Millions of Items (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandr Petrov, Craig Macdonald, Nicola Tonellotto</p>
    <p>Transformer-based recommender systems, such as BERT4Rec or SASRec, achieve state-of-the-art results in sequential recommendation. However, it is challenging to use these models in production environments with catalogues of millions of items: scaling Transformers beyond a few thousand items is problematic for several reasons, including high model memory consumption and slow inference. In this respect, RecJPQ is a state-of-the-art method of reducing the models’ memory consumption; RecJPQ compresses item catalogues by decomposing item IDs into a small number of shared sub-item IDs. Despite reporting the reduction of memory consumption by a factor of up to 50x, the original RecJPQ paper did not report inference efficiency improvements over the baseline Transformer-based models. On analysis of RecJPQ’s scoring algorithm, we find that its efficiency is limited by its use of item score accumulators, which prevent parallelisation. On the other hand, LightRec (a non-sequential method that uses a similar idea of sub-ids) reported large inference efficiency improvements using an algorithm we call PQTopK. We show that it is also possible to improve RecJPQ-based models’ inference efficiency using the PQTopK algorithm. In particular, we speed up RecJPQ-enhanced SASRec by a factor of 4.5x compared to the original SASRec’s inference method and by the factor of 1.56x compared to the method implemented in RecJPQ code on a large-scale Gowalla dataset with more than a million items. Further, using simulated data, we show that PQTopK remains efficient with catalogues of up to tens of millions of items, removing one of the last obstacles to using Transformer-based models in production environments with large catalogues.</p>

    <h3>Multi-Behavioral Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shereen Elsayed, Lars Schmidt-Thieme, Ahmed Rashed</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation models are crucial for next-item prediction tasks in various online platforms, yet many focus on a single behavior, neglecting valuable implicit interactions. While multi-behavioral models address this using graph-based approaches, they often fail to capture sequential patterns simultaneously. Our proposed Multi-Behavioral Sequential Recommendation framework (MBSRec) captures the multi-behavior dependencies between the heterogeneous historical interactions via multi-head self-attention. Furthermore, we utilize a weighted binary cross-entropy loss for precise behavior control. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate MBSRec’s significant outperformance of state-of-the-art approaches. The implementation code is available here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EGRQutc9xtVYbsbXswUcTb9nvT1Tc9cZ?usp=sharing) during the review and will be added to GitHub upon acceptance.</p>

    <h3>CALRec: Contrastive Alignment of Generative LLMs For Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed Hammad, Ivan Vulić, Xiang Zhai, Yaoyiran Li, Anna Korhonen, Keyi Yu, Moustafa Alzantot</p>
    <p>Traditional recommender systems such as matrix factorization methods rely on learning a shared dense embedding space to represent both items and user preferences. Sequence models such as RNN, GRUs, and, recently, Transformers have also excelled in the task of sequential recommendation. The sequential recommendation task requires understanding the sequential structure present in users’ historical interactions to predict the next item they may like. Building upon the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a variety of tasks, researchers have recently explored using LLMs that are pretrained on giant corpora of text for sequential recommendation. To use LLMs in sequential recommendations, both the history of user interactions and the model’s prediction of the next item are expressed in text form. We propose CALRec, a two-stage LLM finetuning framework that finetunes a pretrained LLM in a two-tower fashion using a mixture of two contrastive losses and a language modeling loss: the LLM is first finetuned on a data mixture from multiple domains followed by another round of target domain finetuning. Our model significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art baselines (+37% in Recall@1 and +24% in NDCG@10) and systematic ablation studies reveal that (i) both stages of finetuning are crucial, and, when combined, we achieve improved performance, and (ii) contrastive alignment is effective among the target domains explored in our experiments.</p>

    <h3>gSASRec: Reducing Overconfidence in Sequential Recommendation Trained with Negative Sampling (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Craig Macdonald, Aleksandr V. Petrov</p>
    <p>Large catalogue size is one of the central challenges in training recommendation models: a large number of items makes it infeasible to compute scores for all items during training, forcing models to deploy negative sampling. However, negative sampling increases the proportion of positive interactions in the training data. Therefore models trained with negative sampling tend to overestimate the probabilities of positive interactions — a phenomenon we call overconfidence. While the absolute values of the predicted scores/probabilities are unimportant for ranking retrieved recommendations, overconfident models may fail to estimate nuanced differences in the top-ranked items, resulting in degraded performance. This paper shows that overconfidence explains why the popular SASRec model underperforms when compared to BERT4Rec (contrary to the BERT4Rec authors’ attribution to the bi-directional attention mechanism). We propose a novel Generalised Binary Cross-Entropy Loss function (gBCE) to mitigate overconfidence and theoretically prove that it can mitigate overconfidence. We further propose the gSASRec model, an improvement over SASRec that deploys an increased number of negatives and gBCE loss. We show through detailed experiments on three datasets that gSASRec does not exhibit the overconfidence problem. As a result, gSASRec can outperform BERT4Rec (e.g.\ +9.47\% NDCG on MovieLens-1M), while requiring less training time (e.g.\ -73\% training time on MovieLens-1M). Moreover, in contrast to BERT4Rec, gSASRec is suitable for large datasets that contain more than 1 million items.</p>

    <h3>Distribution-based Learnable Filters with Side Information for Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Wang, Haibo Liu, Zhixiang Deng, Jinjia Peng, Shi Feng</p>
    <p>Sequential Recommendation aims to predict the next item by mining out the dynamic preference from user previous interactions. However, most methods represent each item as a single fixed vector, which is incapable of capturing the uncertainty of item-item transitions that result from time-dependent and multifarious interests of users. Besides, they fail to effectively exploit side information that helps to better express user preferences. At last, the noise in user’s access sequence, which is due to accidental clicks, can interfere with the next item prediction and lead to lower recommendation performance. To deal with these issues, we propose DLFS-Rec, a novel model that combines Distribution-based Learnable Filters with Side information for sequential Recommendation. Specifically, items and their side information are represented by stochastic Gaussian distribution, which is described by mean and covariance embeddings, and then the corresponding embeddings are fused to generate a final representation for each item. To attenuate noise, stacked learnable filter layers are applied to smooth the fused embeddings. The similarities between the distributions inferred from the last filter layer and candidates are measured by 2-Wasserstein distance for generating recommendation list. Extensive experiments on four public real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art baselines, especially on cold start users and items.</p>

    <h3>Sequential Recommendation Models: A Graph-based Perspective (2023)</h3>

    <p>Recommender systems (RecSys) traditionally leverage the users’ rich interaction data with the system, but ignore the sequential dependency of items. Sequential recommender systems aim to predict the next item the user will interact with (e.g., click on, purchase, or listen to) based on the preceding interactions of the user. Current state-of-the-art approaches focus on transformer-based architectures and graph neural networks. Specifically, the modeling of sequences as graphs has shown to be a promising approach to introduce a structured bias into the recommendation learning framework. In this work, we will outline our research of exploring different applications of graphs in sequential recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Understanding and Modeling Passive-Negative Feedback for Short-video Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Gao, Yong Li, Depeng Jin, Yunzhu Pan, Kun Gai, Yang Song</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation is one of the most important tasks in recommender systems, which aims to recommend the next interacted item with historical behaviors as input. Traditional sequential recommendation always mainly considers the collected positive feedback such as click, purchase, etc. However, in short-video platforms such as TikTok, video viewing behavior may not always represent positive feedback. Specifically, the videos are played automatically, and users passively receive the recommended videos. In this new scenario, users passively express negative feedback by skipping over videos they do not like, which provides valuable information about their preferences. Different from the negative feedback studied in traditional recommender systems, this passive-negative feedback can reflect users’ interests and serve as an important supervision signal in extracting users’ preferences. Therefore, it is essential to carefully design and utilize it in this novel recommendation scenario. In this work, we first conduct analyses based on a large-scale real-world short-video behavior dataset and illustrate the significance of leveraging passive feedback. We then propose a novel method that deploys the sub-interest encoder, which incorporates positive feedback and passive-negative feedback as supervision signals to learn the user’s current active sub-interest. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive fusion layer to integrate various sub-interests effectively. To enhance the robustness of our model, we then introduce a multi-task learning module to simultaneously optimize two kinds of feedback – passive-negative feedback and traditional randomly-sampled negative feedback. The experiments on two large-scale datasets verify that the proposed method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches. The codes and collected datasets are anonymously released at https:// anonymous.4open.science/ r/ SINE-2047/ to benefit the community.</p>

    <p>Sequential recommendation problems have received increasing attention in research during the past few years, leading to the inception of a large variety of algorithmic approaches. In this work, we explore how large language models (LLMs), which are nowadays introducing disruptive effects in many AI-based applications, can be used to build or improve sequential recommendation approaches. Specifically, we devise and evaluate three approaches to leverage the power of LLMs in different ways. Our results from experiments on two datasets show that initializing the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation model BERT4Rec with embeddings obtained from an LLM improves NDCG by 15-20% compared to the vanilla BERT4Rec model. Furthermore, we find that a simple approach that leverages LLM embeddings for producing recommendations, can provide competitive performance by highlighting semantically related items. We publicly share the code and data of our experiments to ensure reproducibility.</p>

    <h3>SPARE: Shortest Path Global Item Relations for Efficient Session-based Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Peintner, Eva Zangerle, Amir Reza Mohammadi</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendation aims to predict the next item based on a set of anonymous sessions. Capturing user intent from a short interaction sequence imposes a variety of challenges since no user profiles are available and interaction data is naturally sparse. Recent approaches relying on graph neural networks (GNNs) for session-based recommendation use global item relations to explore collaborative information from different sessions. These methods capture the topological structure of the graph and rely on multi-hop information aggregation in GNNs to exchange information along edges. Consequently, graph-based models suffer from noisy item relations in the training data and introduce high complexity for large item catalogs. We propose to explicitly model the multi-hop information aggregation mechanism over multiple layers via shortest-path edges based on knowledge from the sequential recommendation domain. Our approach does not require multiple layers to exchange information and ignores unreliable item-item relations. Furthermore, to address inherent data sparsity, we are the first to apply supervised contrastive learning by mining data-driven positive and hard negative item samples from the training data. Extensive experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms almost all of the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>Equivariant Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yueqi Xie, Yining Hua, Sunghun Kim, Jaeboum Kim, Shoujin Wang, Jingqi Gao, Qichen Ye, Peilin Zhou</p>
    <p>Contrastive learning (CL) benefits the training of sequential recommendation models with informative self-supervision signals. Existing solutions apply general sequential data augmentation strategies to generate positive pairs and encourage their representations to be invariant. However, due to the inherent properties of user behavior sequences, some augmentation strategies, such as item substitution, can lead to changes in user intent. Learning indiscriminately invariant representations for all augmentation strategies might be sub-optimal. Therefore, we propose Equivariant Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation (ECL-SR), which endows SR models with great discriminative power, making the learned user behavior representations sensitive to invasive augmentations (e.g., item substitution) and insensitive to mild augmentations (e.g., feature-level dropout masking). In detail, we use the conditional discriminator to capture differences in behavior due to item substitution, which encourages the user behavior encoder to be equivariant to invasive augmentations. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed ECL-SR framework achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art SR models. The source code will be released.</p>

    <p>Transformers have become the favored model for sequential recommendation. However, previous studies rely on extensive data, such as massive pre-training or repeated data augmentation, leading to optimization-related problems, such as initialization sensitivity and large batch-size memory bottleneck. In this work, we examine Transformers’ loss geometry to improve the models’ data efficiency during training and generalization. By utilizing a newly introduced sharpness-aware optimizer to promote smoothness, we significantly enhance SASRec’s accuracy and robustness, a Transformer model, on various datasets. When trained on sequential data without significant pre-training or data augmentation, the resulting SASRec outperforms S3Rec and CL4Rec, both of which are of comparable size and throughput.</p>

    <h3>Reciprocal Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Zheng, Hengshu Zhu, Yang Song, Wayne Xin Zhao, Yupeng Hou</p>
    <p>Reciprocal recommender system (RRS), considering a two-way matching between two parties, has been widely applied in online platforms like online dating and recruitment. Existing RRS models mainly capture static user preferences, which have neglected the evolving user tastes and the dynamic matching relation between the two parties. Although dynamic user modeling has been well-studied in sequential recommender systems, existing solutions are developed in a user-oriented manner. Therefore, it is non-trivial to adapt sequential recommendation algorithms to reciprocal recommendation. In this paper, we formulate RRS as a distinctive sequence matching task, and further propose a new approach ReSeq for RRS, which is short for Reciprocal Sequential recommendation. To capture duel-perspective matching, we propose to learn fine-grained sequence similarities by co-attention mechanism across different time steps. Further, to improve the inference efficiency, we introduce the self-distillation technique to distill knowledge from the fine-grained matching module into the more efficient student module. In the deployment stage, only the efficient student module is used, greatly speeding up the similarity computation. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets from two scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
