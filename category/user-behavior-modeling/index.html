    <h3>Scaling Law of Large Sequential Recommendation Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongyu Lu, Yu Chen, Wayne Xin Zhao, Gaowei Zhang, Yupeng Hou, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
    <p>Scaling of neural networks has recently shown great potential to improve the model capacity in various fields. Specifically, model performance has a power-law relationship with model size or data size, which provides important guidance for the development of large-scale models. However, there is still limited understanding on the scaling effect of user behavior models in recommender systems, where the unique data characteristics (e.g., data scarcity and sparsity) pose new challenges in recommendation tasks. In this work, we focus on investigating the scaling laws in large sequential recommendation models. Specifically, we consider a pure ID-based task formulation, where the interaction history of a user is formatted as a chronological sequence of item IDs. We don’t incorporate any side information (e.g., item text), to delve into the scaling law’s applicability from the perspective of user behavior. We successfully scale up the model size to 0.8B parameters, making it feasible to explore the scaling effect in a diverse range of model sizes. As the major findings, we empirically show that the scaling law still holds for these trained models, even in data-constrained scenarios. We then fit the curve for scaling law, and successfully predict the test loss of the two largest tested model scales. Furthermore, we examine the performance advantage of scaling effect on five challenging recommendation tasks, considering the unique issues (e.g., cold start, robustness, long-term preference) in recommender systems. We find that scaling up the model size can greatly boost the performance on these challenging tasks, which again verifies the benefits of large recommendation models.</p>

    <h3>Unified Denoising Training for Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingpeng Du, Ziyan Wang, Haoyan Chua, Zhu Sun, Jie Zhang, Yew-Soon Ong</p>
    <p>Most existing denoising recommendation methods mainly alleviate noisy implicit feedback (user behaviors) through empirical studies. However, such studies may lack theoretical explainability and fail to model comprehensive noise patterns, which hinders understanding and capturing different noise patterns that show distinct effects on users’ behaviors. Thus, we propose to capture comprehensive noise patterns through a holistic theoretical analysis for more effective denoising, whereby users’ behaviors are divided into the willingness (to interact with) and action (to interact with) phases to disentangle the independent noise patterns. Our analysis unveils that (1) in the willingness phase, the high uncertainty of the user’s willingness to interact with the item can lead to high expectation loss, unifying explainability for existing denoising methods; and (2) in the action phase, higher user-specific inconsistency between willingness and action can not only lead to more noise in the user’s overall behaviors but also make it harder to distinguish between her true and noisy behaviors. All these findings are also aligned with our empirical observations. Inspired by these findings, we propose a Unified Denoising Training (UDT) method for recommendation. To alleviate uncertainty in the willingness phase, we lower the importance of the user-item interaction with high willingness uncertainty recognized by high loss. To ease the inconsistency in the action phase, we lower the overall importance for users with high user-specific inconsistency as it may lead to more noisy behaviors, and then increase the importance gap between recognized true and noisy behaviors for users with low user-specific inconsistency as their behaviors are more distinguishable. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our proposed UDT outperforms state-of-the-art denoising recommendation methods.</p>

    <h3>Deep Exploration for Recommendation Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheqing Zhu, Benjamin Van Roy</p>
    <p>Modern recommendation systems ought to benefit by probing for and learning from delayed feedback.  Research has tended to focus on learning from a user’s response to a single recommendation.  Such work, which leverages methods of supervised and bandit learning, forgoes learning from the user’s subsequent behavior.  Where past work has aimed to learn from subsequent behavior, there has been a lack of effective methods for probing to elicit informative delayed feedback.  Effective exploration through probing for delayed feedback becomes particularly challenging when rewards are delayed and sparse.  To address this, we develop deep exploration methods for recommendation systems.  In particular, we formulate recommendation as a sequential decision problem and demonstrate benefits of deep exploration over single-step exploration. Our experiments are carried out with high-fidelity industrial-grade simulators and establish large improvements over existing algorithms.</p>

    <h3>Deep Situation-Aware Interaction Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongkang Wang, Dong Wang, Yisong Yu, Beihong Jin, Yapeng Zhang, Jian Dong, Xingxing Wang, Shuli Wang, Yimin Lv</p>
    <p>User behavior sequence modeling plays a significant role in Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction on e-commerce platforms. Except for the interacted items, user behaviors contain rich interaction information, such as the behavior type, time, location, etc. However, so far, the information related to user behaviors has not yet been fully exploited. In the paper, we propose the concept of a situation and situational features for distinguishing interaction behaviors and then design a CTR model named Deep Situation-Aware Interaction Network (DSAIN). DSAIN first adopts the reparameterization trick to reduce noise in the original user behavior sequences. Then it learns the embeddings of situational features by feature embedding parameterization and tri-directional correlation fusion. Finally, it obtains the embedding of behavior sequence via heterogeneous situation aggregation. We conduct extensive offline experiments on three real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DSAIN model. More importantly, DSAIN has increased the CTR by 2.70\%, the CPM by 2.62\%, and the GMV by 2.16\% in the online A/B test. Now, DSAIN has been deployed on the Meituan food delivery platform and serves the main traffic of the Meituan takeout app. Our source code is available at https://github.com/W-void/DSAIN</p>

    <h3>Incentivizing Exploration in Linear Contextual Bandits under Information Gap (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Liu, Hongning Wang, Huazheng Wang, Chuanhao Li, Haifeng Xu</p>
    <p>Contextual bandit algorithms have been popularly used to address interactive recommendation, where the users are assumed to be cooperative to explore all recommendations from a system. In this paper, we relax this strong assumption and study the problem of incentivized exploration with myopic users, where the users are only interested in recommendations with their currently highest estimated reward. As a result, in order to obtain long-term optimality, the system needs to offer compensation to incentivize the users to take the exploratory recommendations. We consider a new and practically motivated setting where the context features employed by the user are more <i>informative</i> than those used by the system: for example, features based on users’ private information are not accessible by the system. We develop an effective solution for incentivized exploration under such an information gap, and prove that the method achieves a sublinear rate in both regret and compensation. We theoretically and empirically analyze the added compensation due to the information gap, compared with the case where the system has access to the same context features as the user does, i.e., without information gap. Moreover, we also provide a compensation lower bound of this problem.</p>

    <h3>A Multi-view Graph Contrastive Learning Framework for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zitao Xu, Weike Pan, Zhong Ming</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation methods play an irreplaceable role in recommender systems which can capture the users’ dynamic preferences from the behavior sequences. Despite their success, these works usually suffer from the sparsity problem commonly existed in real applications. Cross-domain sequential recommendation aims to alleviate this problem by introducing relatively richer source-domain data. However, most existing methods capture the users’ preferences independently of each domain, which may neglect the item transition patterns across sequences from different domains, i.e., a user’s interaction in one domain may influence his/her next interaction in other domains. Moreover, the data sparsity problem still exists since some items in the target and source domains are interacted with only a limited number of times. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a generic framework named multi-view graph contrastive learning (MGCL). Specifically, we adopt the contrastive mechanism in an intra-domain item representation view and an inter-domain user preference view. The former is to jointly learn the dynamic sequential information in the user sequence graph and the static collaborative information in the cross-domain global graph, while the latter is to capture the complementary information of the user’s preferences from different domains. Extensive empirical studies on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our MGCL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>BVAE: Behavior-aware Variational Autoencoder for Multi-Behavior Multi-Task Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Liu, Qianzhen Rao, Weike Pan, Zhong Ming</p>
    <p>A practical recommender system should be able to handle heterogeneous behavioral feedback as inputs and has multi-task outputs ability. Although the heterogeneous one-class collaborative filtering (HOCCF) and multi-task learning (MTL) methods has been well studied, there is still a lack of targeted manner in their combined fields, i.e., Multi-behavior Multi-task Recommendation (MMR). To fill the gap, we propose a novel recommendation framework called Behavior-aware Variational AutoEncoder (BVAE), which meliorates the parameter sharing and loss minimization method with the VAE structure to address the MMR problem. Specifically, our BVAE includes address behavior-aware semi-encoders and decoders, and a target feature fusion network with a global feature filtering network, while using standard deviation to weigh loss. These modules generate the behavior-aware recommended item list via constructing better semantic feature vectors for users, i.e., from dual perspectives of behavioral preference and global interaction. In addition, we optimize our BVAE in terms of adaptability and robustness, i.e., it is concise and flexible to consume any amount of behaviors with different distributions. Extensive empirical studies on two real and widely used datasets confirm the validity of our design and show that our BVAE can outperform the state-of-the-art related baseline methods under multiple evaluation metrics.</p>

    <h3>Learning to Ride a Buy-Cycle: A Hyper-Convolutional Model for Next Basket Repurchase Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ori Katz, Nir Zabari, Oren Barkan, Noam Koenigstein</p>
    <p>The problem of Next Basket Recommendation (NBR) addresses the challenge of recommending items for the next basket of a user, based on her sequence of prior baskets. In this paper, we focus on a variation of this problem in which we aim to predict repurchases, i.e. we wish to recommend a user only items she had purchased before. We coin this problem Next Basket Repurchase Recommendation (NBRR). Over the years, a variety of models have been proposed to address the problem of NBR, however, the problem of NBRR has been overlooked. Although being highly related problems, which are often solved by the same methods, the problem of repurchase recommendation calls for a different approach. In this paper, we share insights from our experience of facing the challenge of NBRR. In light of these insights, we propose a novel hyper-convolutional model to leverage the behavioral patterns of repeated purchases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on three publicly available datasets, where it is shown to outperform other existing methods across multiple metrics.</p>

    <h3>Discovery Dynamics: Leveraging Repeated Exposure for User and Music Characterization (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Sguerra, Viet-Anh Tran, Romain Hennequin</p>
    <p>Repetition in music consumption is a common phenomenon. It is notably more frequent when compared to the consumption of other media, such as books and movies. In this paper, we show that one particularly interesting repetitive behavior arises when users are consuming new items. Users’ interest tends to rise with the first repetitions and attains a peak after which interest will decrease with subsequent exposures, resulting in an inverted-U shape. This behavior, which has been extensively studied in psychology, is called the mere exposure effect. In this paper, we show how a number of factors, both content and user-based, well documented in the literature on the mere exposure effect, modulate the magnitude of the effect. Due to the vast availability of data of users discovering new songs everyday in music streaming platforms, this findings enable new ways to characterize both the music, users and their relationships. Ultimately, it opens up the possibility of developing new recommender systems paradigms based on these characterizations.</p>

    <h3>Dual Attentional Higher Order Factorization Machines (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prakash Mandayam Comar, Dipankar Das, Vivek Sembium, Arindam Sarkar</p>
    <p>Numerous problems of practical significance such as clickthrough rate (CTR) prediction, forecasting, tagging and so on, involve complex interaction of various user, item and context features. Manual feature engineering has been used in the past to model these combinatorial features but it requires domain expertise and becomes prohibitively expensive as the number of features increases. Feedforward neural networks alleviate the need for manual feature engineering to a large extent and have shown impressive performance across multiple domains due to their ability to learn arbitrary functions. Despite multiple layers of non-linear projections, neural networks are limited in their ability to efficiently model functions with higher order interaction terms. In recent years, Factorization Machines and its variants have been proposed to explicitly capture higher order combinatorial interactions. However not all feature interactions are equally important, and in sparse data settings, without a suitable suppression mechanism, this might result into noisy terms during inference and hurt model generalization. In this work we present Dual Attentional Higher Order Factorization Machine (DA-HoFM), a unified attentional higher order factorization machine which leverages a compositional architecture to compute higher order terms with complexity linear in terms of maximum interaction degree. Equipped with sparse dual attention mechanism, DA-HoFM summarizes interaction terms at each layer, and is able to efficiently select important higher order terms. We empirically demonstrate effectiveness of our proposed models on the task of CTR prediction, where our model exhibits superior performance compared to the recent state-of-the-art models, outperforming them by up to 6.7% on the logloss metric.</p>

    <h3>Large-Scale Modeling of Mobile User Click Behaviors Using Deep Learning (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Li, Xin Zhou</p>
    <p>Modeling tap or click sequences of users on a mobile device can improve our understandings of interaction behavior and offers opportunities for UI optimization by recommending next element the user might want to click on. We analyzed a large-scale dataset of over 20 million clicks from more than 4,000 mobile users who opted in. We then designed a deep learning model that predicts the next element that the user clicks given the user’s click history, the structural information of the UI screen, and the current context such as the time of the day. We thoroughly investigated the deep model by comparing it with a set of baseline methods based on the dataset. The experiments show that our model achieves 48% and 71% accuracy (top-1 and top-3) for predicting next clicks based on a held-out dataset of test users, which significantly outperformed all the baseline methods with a large margin. We discussed a few scenarios for integrating the model in mobile interaction and how users can potentially benefit from the model.</p>

    <h3>ADER: Adaptively Distilled Exemplar Replay Towards Continual Learning for Session-based Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyu Lin, Boi Faltings, Fei Mi</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendation has received growing attention recently due to the increasing privacy concern. Despite the recent success of neural session-based recommenders, they are typically developed in an offline manner using a static dataset. However, recommendation requires continual adaptation to take into account new and obsolete items and users, and requires “continual learning” in real-life applications. In this case, the recommender is updated continually and periodically with new data that arrives in each update cycle, and the updated model needs to provide recommendations for user activities before the next model update. A major challenge for continual learning with neural models is catastrophic forgetting, in which a continually trained model forgets user preference patterns it has learned before. To deal with this challenge, we propose a method called Adaptively Distilled Exemplar Replay (ADER) by periodically replaying previous training samples (i.e., exemplars) to the current model with an adaptive distillation loss. Experiments are conducted based on the state-of-the-art SASRec model using two widely used datasets to benchmark ADER with several well-known continual learning techniques. We empirically demonstrate that ADER consistently outperforms other baselines, and it even outperforms the method using all historical data at every update cycle. This result reveals that ADER is a promising solution to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting issue towards building more realistic and scalable session-based recommenders.</p>

    <h3>Get Me The Best: Predicting Best Answerers in Community Question Answering Sites (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manisha Dubey, Maunendra Sankar Desarkar, Rohan Ravindra Tondulkar</p>
    <p>There has been a massive rise in the use of Community Question and Answering (CQA) forums to get solutions to various technical and non-technical queries. One common problem faced in CQA is the small number of experts, which leaves many questions unanswered. This paper addresses the challenging problem of predicting the best answerer for a new question and thereby recommending the best expert for the same. Although there are work in the literature that aim to find possible answerers for questions posted in CQA, very few algorithms exist for finding the best answerer whose answer will satisfy the information need of the original Poster. For finding answerers, existing approaches mostly use features based on content and tags associated with the questions. There are few approaches that additionally consider the users’ history. In this paper, we propose an approach that considers a comprehensive set of features including but not limited to text representation, tag based similarity as well as multiple user-based features that target users’ availability, agility as well as expertise for predicting the best answerer for a given question. We also include features that give incentives to users who answer less but more important questions over those who answer a lot of questions of less importance. A learning to rank algorithm is used to find the weight for each feature. Experiments conducted on a real dataset from Stack Exchange show the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of multiple evaluation metrics for accuracy, robustness and real time performance.</p>

    <h3>Translation-based Factorization Machines for Sequential Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rajiv Pasricha, Julian McAuley</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation algorithms aim to predict users’ future behavior given their historical interactions over time. A recent line of work has achieved state-of-the-art performance on sequential recommendation tasks by adapting ideas from metric learning and knowledge-base completion. These algorithms replace inner products with low-dimensional embeddings and distance functions, employing a simple translation dynamic to model user behavior over time. In this paper, we propose TransFM, a model that combines translation and metric-based approaches for sequential recommendation with Factorization Machines (FMs). Doing so allows us to reap the benefits of FMs (in particular, the ability to straightforwardly incorporate content-based features), while enhancing the state-of-the-art performance of translation-based models is sequential settings. Specifically, we learn an embedding and translation space for each feature dimension, replacing the inner product with the squared Euclidean distance to measure interaction strength between features. Like FMs, we show that the model equation for TransFM can be computed in linear time and optimized using classical techniques. As TransFM operates on arbitrary feature vectors, additional content information can be easily incorporated without significant changes to the model itself. Empirically, the performance of TransFM significantly increases when taking content features into account, outperforming state-of-the-art models on the sequential recommendation task for a wide variety of datasets.</p>

    <h3>Cross Domain Recommendation Using Vector Space Transfer Learning (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Kazama, Istvan Varga</p>
    <p>The cold start problem, frequent with recommender systems, addresses the issue in cases where we don’t know enough about our users (e.g., the user hasn’t rated anything yet, or there are no user activities) in that specific domain. In our paper we present a simple and robust transfer learning approach where we model users’ behavior in a source domain, transferring that knowledge to a new, target domain. First, we vectorize the items by using word2vec for each dataset independently. Second, we calculate the transformation matrix that connects the source dataset to the target dataset by using their common users.</p>

    <h3>Human-Recommender Systems: From Benchmark Data to Benchmark Cognitive Models (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Shafto, Olfa Nasraoui</p>
    <p>We bring to the fore of the recommender system research community, an inconvenient truth about the current state of understanding how recommender system algorithms and humans influence one another, both computationally and cognitively. Unlike the great variety of supervised machine learning algorithms which traditionally rely on expert input labels and are typically used for decision making by an expert, recommender systems specifically rely on data input from non-expert or casual users and are meant to be used directly by these same non-expert users on an every day basis. Furthermore, the advances in online machine learning, data generation, and predictive model learning have become increasingly interdependent, such that each one feeds on the other in an iterative cycle. Research in psychology suggests that people’s choices are (1) contextually dependent, and (2) dependent on interaction history. Thus, while standard methods of training and assessing performance of recommender systems rely on benchmark datasets, we suggest that a critical step in the evolution of recommender systems is the development of benchmark of human behavior that capture contextual and dynamic aspects of human behavior. It is important to emphasize that even extensive real life user-tests may not be sufficient to make up for this gap in benchmarking validity because user tests are typically done with either a focus on user satisfaction or engagement (clicks, sales, likes, etc) with whatever the recommender algorithm suggests to the user, and thus ignore the human cognitive aspect. We conclude by highlighting the interdisciplinary implications of this endeavor.</p>
