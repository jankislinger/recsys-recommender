    <h3>Less is More: Towards Sustainability-Aware Persuasive Explanations in Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seda Polat Erdeniz, Viet-Man Le, Sebastian Lubos, Alexander Felfernig, Merfat El Mansi, Thi Ngoc Trang Tran</p>
    <p>Recommender systems play an important role in supporting the achievement of the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs). In recommender systems, explanations can support different goals, such as increasing a user’s trust in a recommendation, persuading a user to purchase specific items, or increasing the understanding of the reasons behind a recommendation. In this paper, we discuss the concept of “sustainability-aware persuasive explanations” which we regard as a major concept to support the achievement of the mentioned SDGs. Such explanations are orthogonal to most existing explanation approaches since they focus on a “less is more” principle, which per se is not included in existing e-commerce platforms. Based on a user study in three item domains, we analyze the potential impacts of sustainability-aware persuasive explanations. The study results are promising regarding user acceptance and the potential impacts of such explanations.</p>

    <h3>MAWI Rec: Leveraging Severe Weather Data in Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Surya Kallumadi, Julian Mcauley, Brendan Duncan</p>
    <p>Inferring user intent in recommender systems can help performance but is difficult because intent is personal and not directly observable. Previous work has leveraged signals to stand as a proxy for intent (e.g. user interactions with resource pages), but such signals are not always available. In this paper, we instead recognize that certain events, which are observable, directly influence user intent. For example, after a flood, home improvement customers are more likely to undertake a renovation project to dry out their basement. We introduce MAWI Rec, a recommender system that leverages severe weather data to improve recommendation. Our weather-aware system achieves a significant improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline for online and in-store datasets of home improvement customers. This gain is most significant for weather-related product categories such as roof panels and flashings.</p>
