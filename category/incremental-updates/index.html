    <h3>Incremental Matrix Factorization via Feature Space Re-learning for Recommender System (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian Cheng, Hanqing Lu, Qiang Song</p>
    <p>Matrix factorization is widely used in Recommender Systems. Although existing popular incremental matrix factorization methods are effectively in reducing time complexity, they simply assume that the similarity between items or users is invariant. For instance, they keep the item feature matrix unchanged and just update the user matrix without re-training the entire model. However, with the new users growing continuously, the fitting error would be accumulated since the extra distribution information of items has not been utilized. In this paper, we present an alternative and reasonable approach, with a relaxed assumption that the similarity between items (users) is relatively stable after updating. Concretely, utilizing the prediction error of the new data as the auxiliary features, our method updates both feature matrices simultaneously, and thus users’ preference can be better modeled than merely adjusting one corresponded feature matrix. Besides, our method maintains the feature dimension in a smaller size through taking advantage of matrix sketching. Experimental results show that our proposal outperforms the existing incremental matrix factorization methods.</p>

    <h3>Context Adaptation in Interactive Recommender Systems (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Burke, Negar Hariri, Bamshad Mobasher</p>
    <p>Contextual factors can greatly influence the utility of recommendations for users. In many recommendation and personalization applications, particularly in domains where user context changes dynamically, it is difficult to represent and model contextual factors directly, but it is often possible to observe their impact on user preferences during the course of users’ interactions with the system. In this paper, we introduce an interactive recommender system that can detect and adapt to changes in context based on the user’s ongoing behavior. The system, then, dynamically tailors its recommendations to match the user’s most recent preferences. We formulate this problem as a multi-armed bandit problem and use Thompson sampling heuristic to learn a model for the user. Following the Thompson sampling approach, the user model is updated after each interaction as the system observes the corresponding rewards for the recommendations provided during that interaction. To generate contextual recommendations, the user’s preference model is monitored for changes at each step of interaction with the user and is updated incrementally. We will introduce a mechanism for detecting significant changes in the user’s preferences and will describe how it can be used to improve the performance of the recommender system.</p>
