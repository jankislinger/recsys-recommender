    <h3>Scalable Deep Q-Learning for Session-Based Slate Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aonghus Lawlor, Edoardo Dâ€™Amico, Aayush Singha Roy, Neil Hurley, Elias Tragos</p>
    <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential to improve slate-based recommender systems by optimizing recommendations for long-term user engagement. To handle the combinatorial action space in slate recommendation, recent works decompose the Q-value of a slate into item-wise Q-values, using an item-wise value-based policy. However, the common case where the value function is a parameterized function taking state and action as input results in a linearly increasing number of evaluations required to select an action, proportional to the number of candidate items. While slow training may be acceptable, this becomes intractable when considering the costly evaluation of the parameterized function, such as with deep neural networks, during model serving time. To address this issue, we propose an actor-based policy that reduces the evaluation of the Q-function to a subset of items, significantly reducing inference time and enabling practical deployment in real-world industrial settings. In our empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves equivalent user session engagement to a value-based policy, while significantly reducing the slate serving time by at least 4 times.</p>

    <h3>Position Awareness Modeling with Knowledge Distillation for CTR Prediction (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuejiang Li, Fei Teng, Zhangang Lin, Jingping Shao, Congcong Liu, Changping Peng, Jian Zhu, Xiwei Zhao</p>
    <p>Click-through rate (CTR) Prediction is of great importance in real-world online ads systems. One challenge for the CTR prediction task is to capture the real interest of users from their clicked items, which is inherently influenced by presented positions of items, i.e., more front positions tend to obtain higher CTR values. Therefore, It is crucial to make CTR models aware of the exposed position of the items. A popular line of existing works focuses on explicitly model exposed position by result randomization which is expensive and inefficient, or by inverse propensity weighting (IPW) which relies heavily on the quality of the propensity estimation. Another common solution is modeling position as features during offline training and simply adopting fixed value or dropout tricks when serving. However, training-inference inconsistency can lead to sub-optimal performance. This work proposes a simple yet efficient knowledge distillation framework to model the impact of exposed position and leverage position information to improve CTR prediction. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method on a real-world production dataset and online A/B tests, achieving significant improvements over competing baseline models. The proposed method has been deployed in the real world online ads systems of JD, serving main traffic of hundreds of millions of active users.</p>
