    <h3>Improving the Shortest Plank: Vulnerability-Aware Adversarial Training for Robust Recommender System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fei Sun, Qi Cao, Yunfan Wu, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng, Kaike Zhang</p>
    <p>Recommender systems play a pivotal role in mitigating information overload in diverse fields. Nonetheless, the inherent openness of these systems introduces vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to insert fake users to skew the exposure of certain items, known as poisoning attacks. Adversarial training emerges as a notable defense mechanism against such poisoning attacks within recommender systems. Traditional adversarial training methods apply perturbations with the same scale across all users to their embeddings to maintain system robustness against the worst-case attacks. Yet, in reality, attacks often affect only a subset of users who are actually vulnerable to the specific attacks. These indiscriminate perturbations make it difficult to balance effective protection for vulnerable users and avoidance of recommendation quality degradation for those who are not. To address this issue, our research delves into understanding user vulnerability. Considering that poisoning attacks pollutes the training data, we observe that the extent of a recommender system’s fit to users’ training data, particularly when high, correlates with an increased likelihood of users incorporating attack information, thus indicating their vulnerability. Leveraging these insights, we introduce the Vulnerability-aware Adversarial Training (VAT) method, designed to counteract poisoning attacks in recommender systems. VAT employs a novel vulnerability-aware function to estimate users’ vulnerability based on the degree to which they are fitted by the system. Guided by this evaluation, VAT applies user-specific perturbations to embeddings. thereby not only reducing the success rate of attacks but also preserving—and potentially enhancing—the quality of recommendations. Comprehensive experiments confirm VAT’s superior defensive capabilities against various attacks and recommendation models.</p>

    <h3>Adversarial Attacks on an Oblivious Recommender (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantina Christakopoulou, Arindam Banerjee</p>
    <p>Can machine learning models be easily fooled? Despite the recent surge of interest in  learned adversarial attacks in other domains, in the context of recommendation systems this question has mainly been answered using hand-engineered fake user profiles. This paper attempts to reduce this gap. We provide a formulation for learning to attack a recommender as a repeated general-sum game between two players, i.e., an adversary and a recommender oblivious to the adversary’s existence. We consider the challenging case of poisoning attacks, which focus on the training phase of the recommender model. We generate adversarial user profiles targeting subsets of users or items, or generally the top-K recommendation quality. Moreover, we ensure that the adversarial user profiles remain unnoticeable by preserving proximity of the real user rating/ interaction distribution to the adversarial fake user distribution. To cope with the challenge of the adversary not having access to the gradient of the recommender’s objective with respect to the fake user profiles, we provide a non-trivial algorithm building upon zero-order optimization techniques. We offer a wide range of experiments, instantiating the proposed method for the case of the classic popular approach of a low-rank recommender, and illustrating the extent of the recommender’s vulnerability to a variety of adversarial intents. These results can serve as a motivating point for more research into recommender defense strategies against machine learned attacks.</p>
