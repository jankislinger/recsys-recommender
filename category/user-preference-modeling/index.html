    <h3>Towards Empathetic Conversational Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingfei Liang, Yougang Lyu, Zhaochun Ren, Zhanhui Kang, Pengjie Ren, Xin Xin, Xiaoyu Zhang, Bo Zhang, Maarten de Rijke, Ruobing Xie</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) are able to elicit user preferences through multi-turn dialogues. They typically incorporate external knowledge and pre-trained language models to capture the dialogue context. Most CRS approaches, trained on benchmark datasets, assume that the standard items and responses in these benchmarks are optimal. However, they overlook that users may express negative emotions with the standard items and may not feel emotionally engaged by the standard responses. This issue leads to a tendency to replicate the logic of recommenders in the dataset instead of aligning with user needs. To remedy this misalignment, we introduce empathy within a CRS. With empathy we refer to a system’s ability to capture and express emotions. We propose an empathetic conversational recommender (ECR) framework. ECR contains two main modules: emotion-aware item recommendation and emotion-aligned response generation. Specifically, we employ user emotions to refine user preference modeling for accurate recommendations. To generate human-like emotional responses, ECR applies retrieval-augmented prompts to fine-tune a pre-trained language model aligning with emotions and mitigating hallucination. To address the challenge of insufficient supervision labels, we enlarge our empathetic data using emotion labels annotated by large language models and emotional reviews collected from external resources. We propose novel evaluation metrics to capture user satisfaction in real-world CRS scenarios. Our experiments on the ReDial dataset validate the efficacy of our framework in enhancing recommendation accuracy and improving user satisfaction.</p>

    <h3>Towards Open-World Recommendation with Knowledge Augmentation from Large Language Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiwen Liu, Bo Chen, Yong Yu, Hong Zhu, Yunjia Xi, Weinan Zhang, Jianghao Lin, Xiaoling Cai, Jieming Zhu, Ruiming Tang</p>
    <p>Recommender system plays a vital role in various online services. However, its insulated nature of training and deploying separately within a specific closed domain limits its access to open-world knowledge. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in bridging this gap by encoding extensive world knowledge and demonstrating reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, previous attempts to directly use LLMs as recommenders cannot meet the inference latency demand of industrial recommender systems. In this work, we propose an Open-World Knowledge Augmented Recommendation Framework with Large Language Models, dubbed KAR, to acquire two types of external knowledge from LLMs — the reasoning knowledge on user preferences and the factual knowledge on items. We introduce factorization prompting to elicit accurate reasoning on user preferences. The generated reasoning and factual knowledge are effectively transformed and condensed into augmented vectors by a hybrid-expert adaptor in order to be compatible with the recommendation task. The obtained vectors can then be directly used to enhance the performance of any recommendation model. We also ensure efficient inference by preprocessing and prestoring the knowledge from the LLM. Extensive experiments show that KAR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and is compatible with a wide range of recommendation algorithms. We deploy KAR to Huawei’s news and music recommendation platforms and gain a 7% and 1.7% improvement in the online A/B test, respectively.</p>

    <h3>Adaptive Collaborative Filtering with Personalized Time Decay Functions for Financial Product Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baptiste Barreau, Michalis Vazirgiannis, Ashraf Ghiye, Laurent Carlier</p>
    <p>Classical recommender systems often assume that historical data are stationary and fail to account for the dynamic nature of user preferences, limiting their ability to provide reliable recommendations in time-sensitive settings. This assumption is particularly problematic in finance, where financial products exhibit continuous changes in valuations, leading to frequent shifts in client interests. These evolving interests, summarized in the past client-product interactions, see their utility fade over time with a degree that might differ from one client to another. To address this challenge, we propose a time-dependent collaborative filtering algorithm that can adaptively discount distant client-product interactions using personalized decay functions. Our approach is designed to handle the non-stationarity of financial data and produce reliable recommendations by modeling the dynamic collaborative signals between clients and products. We evaluate our method using a proprietary dataset from BNP Paribas and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art benchmarks from relevant literature. Our findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time explicitly in the model to enhance the accuracy of financial product recommendation.</p>

    <h3>An Interpretable Neural Network Model for Bundle Recommendations (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward C. Malthouse, Xinyi Li</p>
    <p>A users’ preference for a bundle – a set of items that can be purchased together – can be expressed by the utility of this bundle to the user. The multi-attribute utility theory motivate us to characterize the utility of a bundle using its attributes to improve the personalized bundle recommendation systems. This extended abstract for the Doctoral Symposium describes my PhD project for studying the utility of a bundle using its attributes. The steps taken and some preliminary results are presented, with an outline of the future plans.</p>

    <h3>FISSA: Fusing Item Similarity Models with Self-Attention Networks for Sequential Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing Lin, Zhong Ming, Weike Pan</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation has been a hot research topic because of its practicability and high accuracy by capturing the sequential information. As deep learning (DL) based methods being widely adopted to model the local and dynamic preferences beneath users’ behavior sequences, the modeling of users’ global and static preferences tends to be underestimated that usually, only some simple and crude users’ latent representations are introduced. Moreover, most existing methods hold an assumption that users’ intention can be fully captured by considering the historical behaviors, while neglect the possible uncertainty of users’ intention in reality, which may be influenced by the appearance of the candidate items to be recommended. In this paper, we thus focus on these two issues, i.e., the imperfect modeling of users’ global preferences in most DL-based sequential recommendation methods and the uncertainty of users’ intention brought by the candidate items, and propose a novel solution named fusing item similarity models with self-attention networks (FISSA) for sequential recommendation. Specifically, we treat the state-of-the-art self-attentive sequential recommendation (SASRec) model as the local representation learning module to capture the dynamic preferences beneath users’ behavior sequences in our FISSA, and further propose a global representation learning module to improve the modeling of users’ global preferences and a gating module that balances the local and global representations by taking the information of the candidate items into account. The global representation learning module can be seen as a location-based attention layer, which is effective to fit in well with the parallelization training process of the self-attention framework. The gating module calculates the weight by modeling the relationship among the candidate item, the recently interacted item and the global preference of each user using an MLP layer. Extensive empirical studies on five commonly used datasets show that our FISSA significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines in terms of two commonly used metrics.</p>

    <h3>Pairwise Preferences Based Matrix Factorization and Nearest Neighbor Recommendation Techniques (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marko Tkalcic, Francesco Ricci, Saikishore Kalloori</p>
    <p>Many recommendation techniques rely on the knowledge of preferences data in the form of ratings for items. In this paper, we focus on pairwise preferences as an alternative way for acquiring user preferences and building recommendations. In our scenario, users provide pairwise preference scores for a set of item pairs, indicating how much one item in each pair is preferred to the other. We propose a matrix factorization (MF) and a nearest neighbor (NN) prediction techniques for pairwise preference scores. Our MF solution maps users and items pairs to a joint latent features vector space, while the proposed NN algorithm leverages specific user-to-user similarity functions well suited for comparing users preferences of that type. We compare our approaches to state of the art solutions and show that our solutions produce more accurate pairwise preferences and ranking predictions.</p>
