    <h3>User knowledge prompt for sequential recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuuki Tachioka</p>
    <p>The large language model (LLM) based recommendation system is effective for sequential recommendation, because general knowledge of popular items is included in the LLM. To add domain knowledge of items, the conventional method uses a knowledge prompt obtained from the item knowledge graphs and has achieved SOTA performance. However, for personalized recommendation, it is necessary to consider user knowledge, which the conventional method does not fully consider because user knowledge is not included in the item knowledge graphs; thus, we propose a user knowledge prompt, which converts a user knowledge graph into a prompt using the relationship template. The existing prompt denoising framework is extended to prevent hallucination caused by undesirable interactions between knowledge graph prompts. We propose user knowledge prompts of user traits and user preferences and associate relevant items. Experiments on three types of dataset (movie, music, and book) show the significant and consistent improvement of our proposed user knowledge prompt.</p>

    <h3>Transformers Meet ACT-R: Repeat-Aware and Sequential Listening Session Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Sguerra, Viet-Anh Tran, Romain Hennequin, Guillaume Salha-Galvan</p>
    <p>Music streaming services often leverage sequential recommender systems to predict the best music to showcase to users based on past sequences of listening sessions. Nonetheless, most sequential recommendation methods ignore or insufficiently account for repetitive behaviors. This is a crucial limitation for music recommendation, as repeatedly listening to the same song over time is a common phenomenon, that can even change the way users perceive this song. In this paper, we introduce PISA (Psychology-Informed Session embedding using ACT-R), a session-level sequential recommender system that overcomes this limitation. PISA employs a Transformer architecture learning embedding representations of listening sessions and users using attention mechanisms inspired by Anderson’s ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Though-Rational), a cognitive architecture modeling human information access and memory dynamics. This approach enables us to capture dynamic and repetitive patterns from user behaviors, allowing us to effectively predict the songs they will listen to in subsequent sessions, whether they are repeated or new ones. We demonstrate the empirical relevance of PISA using public listening data from Last.fm and proprietary data from a global music streaming service, thereby confirming the critical importance of repetition modeling for sequential listening session recommendation. Along with this paper, we publicly release our proprietary dataset to foster future research in this field, as well as the source code of PISA to facilitate its future use.</p>

    <h3>Right Tool, Right Job: Recommendation for Repeat and Exploration Consumption in Food Delivery (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayu Li, Aixin Sun, Min Zhang, Weizhi Ma, Peijie Sun</p>
    <p>From e-commerce to music and news, recommender systems are tailored to specific scenarios. While researching generic models applicable to various scenarios is crucial, studying recommendations based on the unique characteristics of a specific and vital scenario holds both research and, more importantly, practical value. In this paper, we focus on store recommendations in the food delivery scenario, which is an intriguing and significant domain with unique behavior patterns and influential factors. First, we offer an in-depth analysis of real-world food delivery data across platforms and countries, revealing that (i) repeat and exploration orders are both noticeable behaviors and (ii) the influences of historical and collaborative situations on repeat and exploration consumption are distinct. Second, based on the observations, we separately design two simple yet effective recommendation models: <i>RepRec</i> for repeat orders and <i>ExpRec</i> for exploration ones. An ensemble module is further proposed to combine recommendations from two models for a unified recommendation list. Finally, experiments are conducted on three datasets spanning three countries across two food delivery platforms. Results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed recommenders on repeat, exploration, and combined recommendation tasks over various baselines. Such simple yet effective approaches will be beneficial for real applications. This work shows that dedicated analyses and methods for domain-specific characteristics are essential for the recommender system studies.</p>

    <h3>Stability of Explainable Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sairamvinay Vijayaraghavan, Prasant Mohapatra</p>
    <p>Explainable Recommendation has been gaining attention over the last few years in industry and academia. Explanations provided along with recommendations for each user in a recommender system framework have many uses: particularly reasoning why a suggestion is provided and how well an item aligns with a user’s personalized preferences. Hence, explanations can play a huge role in influencing users to purchase products. However, the reliability of the explanations under varying scenarios has not been strictly verified in an empirical perspective. Unreliable explanations can bear strong consequences such as attackers leveraging explanations for manipulating and tempting users to purchase target items: that the attackers would want to promote. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of existent feature-oriented explainable recommenders, particularly analyzing their performance under different levels of external noises added into model parameters. We conducted experiments by analyzing three important state-of-the-art explainable recommenders when trained on two widely used e-commerce based recommendation datasets of different scales. We observe that all the explainable models are vulnerable to increased noise levels. Experimental results verify our hypothesis that the ability to explain recommendations does decrease along with increasing noise levels and particularly adversarial noise does contribute to a much stronger decrease. Our study presents an empirical verification on the topic of robust explanations in recommender systems which can be extended to different types of explainable recommenders in RS.</p>

    <h3>BVAE: Behavior-aware Variational Autoencoder for Multi-Behavior Multi-Task Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Liu, Qianzhen Rao, Weike Pan, Zhong Ming</p>
    <p>A practical recommender system should be able to handle heterogeneous behavioral feedback as inputs and has multi-task outputs ability. Although the heterogeneous one-class collaborative filtering (HOCCF) and multi-task learning (MTL) methods has been well studied, there is still a lack of targeted manner in their combined fields, i.e., Multi-behavior Multi-task Recommendation (MMR). To fill the gap, we propose a novel recommendation framework called Behavior-aware Variational AutoEncoder (BVAE), which meliorates the parameter sharing and loss minimization method with the VAE structure to address the MMR problem. Specifically, our BVAE includes address behavior-aware semi-encoders and decoders, and a target feature fusion network with a global feature filtering network, while using standard deviation to weigh loss. These modules generate the behavior-aware recommended item list via constructing better semantic feature vectors for users, i.e., from dual perspectives of behavioral preference and global interaction. In addition, we optimize our BVAE in terms of adaptability and robustness, i.e., it is concise and flexible to consume any amount of behaviors with different distributions. Extensive empirical studies on two real and widely used datasets confirm the validity of our design and show that our BVAE can outperform the state-of-the-art related baseline methods under multiple evaluation metrics.</p>

    <h3>Incentivizing Exploration in Linear Contextual Bandits under Information Gap (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Liu, Hongning Wang, Huazheng Wang, Chuanhao Li, Haifeng Xu</p>
    <p>Contextual bandit algorithms have been popularly used to address interactive recommendation, where the users are assumed to be cooperative to explore all recommendations from a system. In this paper, we relax this strong assumption and study the problem of incentivized exploration with myopic users, where the users are only interested in recommendations with their currently highest estimated reward. As a result, in order to obtain long-term optimality, the system needs to offer compensation to incentivize the users to take the exploratory recommendations. We consider a new and practically motivated setting where the context features employed by the user are more <i>informative</i> than those used by the system: for example, features based on users’ private information are not accessible by the system. We develop an effective solution for incentivized exploration under such an information gap, and prove that the method achieves a sublinear rate in both regret and compensation. We theoretically and empirically analyze the added compensation due to the information gap, compared with the case where the system has access to the same context features as the user does, i.e., without information gap. Moreover, we also provide a compensation lower bound of this problem.</p>

    <h3>Uncertainty-adjusted Inductive Matrix Completion with Graph Neural Networks (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Ledent, Petr Kasalicky, Rodrigo Alves</p>
    <p>We propose a robust recommender systems model which performs matrix completion and a ratings-wise uncertainty estimation jointly. Whilst the prediction module is purely based on an implicit low-rank assumption imposed via nuclear norm regularization, our loss function is augmented by an uncertainty estimation module which learns an anomaly score for each individual rating via a Graph Neural Network: data points deemed more anomalous by the GNN are downregulated in the loss function used to train the low-rank module. The whole model is trained in an end-to-end fashion, allowing the anomaly detection module to tap on the supervised information available in the form of ratings. Thus, our model’s predictors enjoy the favourable generalization properties that come with being chosen from small function space (i.e., low-rank matrices), whilst exhibiting the robustness to outliers and flexibility that comes with deep learning methods. Furthermore, the anomaly scores themselves contain valuable qualitative information. Experiments on various real-life datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms standard matrix completion and other baselines, confirming the usefulness of the anomaly detection module.</p>

    <h3>You Say Factorization Machine, I Say Neural Network – It’s All in the Activation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yedid Hoshen, Chen Almagor</p>
    <p>In recent years, many methods for machine learning on tabular data were introduced that use either factorization machines, neural networks or both. This created a great variety of methods making it non-obvious which method should be used in practice. We begin by extending the previously established theoretical connection between polynomial neural networks and factorization machines (FM) to recently introduced FM techniques. This allows us to propose a single neural-network-based framework that can switch between the deep learning and FM paradigms by a simple change of an activation function. We further show that an activation function exists which can adaptively learn to select the optimal paradigm. Another key element in our framework is its ability to learn high-dimensional embeddings by low-rank factorization. Our framework can handle numeric and categorical data as well as multiclass outputs. Extensive empirical experiments verify our analytical claims.

    <h3>Dynamic Global Sensitivity for Differentially Private Contextual Bandits (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongning Wang, David B. Zhao, Huazheng Wang</p>
    <p>Bandit algorithms have become a reference solution for interactive recommendation. However, as such algorithms directly interact with users for improved recommendations, serious privacy concerns have been raised regarding its practical use. In this work, we propose a differentially private linear contextual bandit algorithm, via a tree-based mechanism to add Laplace or Gaussian noise to model parameters. Our key insight is that as the model converges during online update, the global sensitivity of its parameters shrinks over time (thus named dynamic global sensitivity). Compared with existing solutions, our dynamic global sensitivity analysis allows us to inject less noise to obtain (ϵ, δ)-differential privacy with added regret caused by noise injection in . We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis over the amount of noise added via dynamic global sensitivity and the corresponding upper regret bound of our proposed algorithm. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets confirmed the algorithm’s advantage against existing solutions.</p>

    <h3>Transfer Learning in Collaborative Recommendation for Bias Reduction (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weike Pan, Dugang Liu, Zinan Lin, Zhong Ming</p>
    <p>In a recommender system, a user’s interaction is often biased by the items’ displaying positions and popularity, as well as the user’s self-selection. Most existing recommendation models are built using such a biased user-system interaction data. In this paper, we first additionally introduce a specially collected unbiased data and then propose a novel transfer learning solution, i.e., transfer via joint reconstruction (TJR), to achieve knowledge transfer and sharing between the biased data and unbiased data. Specifically, in our TJR, we refine the prediction via the latent features containing bias information in order to obtain a more accurate and unbiased prediction. Moreover, we integrate the two data by reconstructing their interaction in a joint learning manner. We then adopt three representative methods as the backbone models of our TJR and conduct extensive empirical studies on two public datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of our transfer learning solution over some very competitive baselines.</p>

    <h3>A Payload Optimization Method for Federated Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuan Eeik Tan, Zareen Alamgir, Muhammad Ammad-ud-din, Farwa K. Khan, Adrian Flanagan</p>
    <p>In this study, we introduce the payload optimization method for federated recommender systems (FRS). In federated learning (FL), the global model payload that is moved between the server and users depends on the number of items to recommend. The model payload grows when there is an increasing number of items. This becomes challenging for FRS if it is running in production mode. To tackle the payload challenge, we formulated a multi-arm bandit solution that selected part of the global model and transmitted it to all users. The selection process was guided by a novel reward function suitable for FL systems. So far as we are aware, this is the first optimization method that seeks to address item dependent payloads. The method was evaluated using three benchmark recommendation datasets. The empirical validation confirmed that the proposed method outperforms the simpler methods that do not benefit from the bandits for the purpose of item selection. In addition, we have demonstrated the usefulness of our proposed method by rigorously evaluating the effects of a payload reduction on the recommendation performance degradation. Our method achieved up to a 90% reduction in model payload, yielding only a ∼ 4% - 8% loss in the recommendation performance for highly sparse datasets.</p>

    <h3>Learning An Adaptive Meta Model-Generator for Incrementally Updating Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Zhang, Sinno Jialin Pan, Danni Peng, Anxiang Zeng</p>
    <p>Recommender Systems (RSs) in real-world applications often deal with billions of user interactions daily. To capture the most recent trends effectively, it is common to update the model incrementally using only the newly arrived data. However, this may impede the model’s ability to retain long-term information due to the potential overfitting and forgetting issues. To address this problem, we propose a novel Adaptive Sequential Model Generation (ASMG) framework, which generates a better serving model from a sequence of historical models via a meta generator. For the design of the meta generator, we propose to employ Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to leverage its ability to capture the long-term dependencies. We further introduce some novel strategies to apply together with the GRU meta generator, which not only improve its computational efficiency but also enable more accurate sequential modeling. By instantiating the model-agnostic framework on a general deep learning-based RS model, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets and one industrial dataset.</p>

    <h3>Content-Collaborative Disentanglement Representation Learning for Enhanced Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yin Zhang, Yun He, James Caverlee, Ziwei Zhu</p>
    <p>Modern recommenders usually consider both collaborative features from user behavior data (e.g., clicks) and content information about the users and items (e.g., user ages or item images) for improved recommendations. While encouraging, the uncovered user preference representations derived from these collaborative and content-based perspectives can be entangled by intermixing the influence from each other, leading to sub-optimal performance and unstable recommendations. Hence, we propose to disentangle representations learned from user behavior data and content information. Specifically, we propose a novel two-level disentanglement generative recommendation model (DICER) that supports both content-collaborative disentanglement and feature disentanglement: for the content-collaborative disentanglement, DICER decomposes the features by their marginal distributions based on content and user-item interactions, to ensure the learned features from each type are statistically independent. For feature disentanglement, by decomposing the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we theoretically show that extracted features within each type are disentangled at a granular level. Furthermore, DICER utilizes a co-decoder that simultaneously decodes the content and user-item interactions to ensure the high-quality of learned features. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, results show that DICER significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by 13.5% in NDCG and 14.4% in hit ratio on average.</p>

    <p>Recommender systems today face major challenges in keeping up with dynamic customer preferences. Disruptions or sudden changes in the environment affect customer preferences drastically and render historical data ineffective for modeling. With businesses relying heavily on Machine Learning(ML) based recommender systems for catering to customer preferences, the accuracy of timely recommendations gains prime significance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel concept, LDT (Labeled Data Threshold), a newly defined parameter to determine the sufficiency of available labeled training data. Our proposed scheme, using LDT leads to a significant reduction (  50X) in the training time for a model, thus enabling recommender systems to adapt quickly to disruptions. We illustrate the efficacy of our proposed scheme, by conducting extensive experimental analysis on six well known, structured data sets from various public domains.</p>

    <h3>Debiasing Item-to-Item Recommendations With Small Annotated Datasets (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Schnabel, Paul N. Bennett</p>
    <p>Item-to-item recommendation (e.g., “People who like this also like...”) is a ubiquitous and important type of recommendation in real-world systems. Observational data from historical interaction logs abound in these settings. However, since virtually all observational data exhibit biases, such as time-in-inventory or interface biases, it is crucial that recommender algorithms account for these biases. In this paper, we develop a principled approach for item-to-item recommendation based on causal inference and present a practical and highly effective method for estimating the causal parameters from a small annotated dataset. Empirically, we find that our approach substantially improves upon existing methods while requiring only small amounts of annotated data.</p>

    <h3>Doubly Robust Estimator for Ranking Metrics with Post-Click Conversions (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuta Saito</p>
    <p>Post-click conversion, a pre-defined action on a web service after a click, is an essential form of feedback, as it directly contributes to the final revenue and accurately captures user preferences for items, compared with the ambiguous click. However, naively using post-click conversions can lead to severe bias when learning or evaluating recommenders because of the selection bias between clicked and unclicked data. In this study, we address the offline evaluation problem of algorithmic recommendations with biased post-click conversions. A possible solution to address this bias is to use the inverse propensity score estimator, as it can provide an unbiased evaluation even with the selection bias. However, this estimator is known to be subject to variance and instability problems, which can be severe in the recommendation setting, as feedback is often highly sparse. To address these limitations with the previous unbiased estimator, we propose a doubly robust estimator for the ground-truth ranking performance of a given recommender. The proposed estimator is unbiased against the ground-truth ranking metric and improves the variance and estimation error tail bound of the existing unbiased estimator. Finally, to evaluate the empirical efficacy of the proposed estimator, we conduct empirical evaluations using semi-synthetic and two public real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed metric reveals a better model evaluation performance compared with existing baseline metrics, particularly in a situation with severe selection bias.</p>
