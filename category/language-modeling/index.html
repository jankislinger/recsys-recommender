    <h3>Reproducibility of LLM-based Recommender Systems: the case study of P5 paradigm (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Polignano, Cataldo Musto, Giovanni Semeraro, Pasquale Lops, Antonio Silletti</p>
    <p>Recommender systems field may greatly benefit of the availability of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs), which can serve as the core mechanism to generate recommendations based on detailed user and item data, such as textual descriptions, user reviews, and metadata.  On one hand this new generation of LLM-based recommender systems paves the way to deal with traditional limitations, such as cold-start and data sparsity, but on the other hand this poses fundamental challenges for their accountability.  Reproducing experiments in the new context of LLM-based recommender systems is very challenging for several reasons. New approaches are published at an unprecedented pace, which makes difficult to have a clear picture of the main protocols and good practices in the experimental evaluation. Moreover, the lack of proper frameworks for LLM-based recommendation development and evaluation makes the process of benchmarking models complex and uncertain. In this work, we discuss the main issues encountered when trying to reproduce P5 (Pretrain, Personalized Prompt, and Prediction Paradigm), one of the first works unifying different recommendation tasks in a shared language modeling and natural language generation framework.  Starting from this study, we have developed OurFramework4LLM (anonymized name), a framework for training and evaluating LLMs, specifically for the recommendation task. It has been used to perform several experiments to assess the impact of different LLMs, personalization and novel set of more informative prompts on the overall performance of recommendations, in a fully reproducible environment.</p>

    <h3>Track Mix Generation on Music Streaming Services using Transformers (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Bouabça, Walid Bendada, Benjamin Chapus, Thibault Cador, Théo Bontempelli, Mathieu Morlon, Guillaume Salha-Galvan</p>
    <p>This paper introduces Track Mix, a personalized playlist generation system released in 2022 on the music streaming service Deezer. Track Mix automatically generates “mix” playlists inspired by initial music tracks, allowing users to discover music similar to their favorite content. To generate these mixes, we consider a Transformer model trained on millions of track sequences from user playlists. In light of the growing popularity of Transformers in recent years, we analyze the advantages, drawbacks, and technical challenges of using such a model for mix generation on the service, compared to a more traditional collaborative filtering approach. Since its release, Track Mix has been generating playlists for millions of users daily, enhancing their music discovery experience on Deezer.</p>

    <h3>Relaxed Softmax for PU Learning (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ugo Tanielian, Flavian Vasile</p>
    <p>In recent years, the softmax model and its fast approximations have become the de-facto loss functions for deep neural networks when dealing with multi-class prediction. This loss has been extended to language modeling and recommendation, two fields that fall into the framework of learning from Positive and Unlabeled data. In this paper, we stress the different drawbacks of the current family of softmax losses and sampling schemes when applied in a Positive and Unlabeled learning setup. We propose both a Relaxed Softmax loss (RS) and a new negative sampling scheme based on a Boltzmann formulation. We show that the new training objective is better suited for the tasks of density estimation, item similarity and next-event prediction by driving uplifts in performance on textual and recommendation datasets against classical softmax.</p>
