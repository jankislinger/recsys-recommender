    <h3>Touch the Core: Exploring Task Dependence Among Hybrid Targets for Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiuqiang He, Xing Tang, Dugang Liu, Yang Qiao, Fuyuan Lyu</p>
    <p>As user behaviors become complicated on business platforms, online recommendations focus more on how to touch the core conversions, which are highly related to the interests of platforms. These core conversions are usually continuous targets, such as watch time, revenue, and so on, whose predictions can be enhanced by previous discrete conversion actions. Therefore, multi-task learning (MTL) can be adopted as the paradigm to learn these hybrid targets. However, existing works mainly emphasize investigating the sequential dependence among discrete conversion actions, which neglects the complexity of dependence between discrete conversions and the final continuous conversion. Moreover, simultaneously optimizing hybrid tasks with stronger task dependence will suffer from volatile issues where the core regression task might have a larger influence on other tasks. In this paper, we study the MTL problem with hybrid targets for the first time and propose the model named Hybrid Targets Learning Network (HTLNet) to explore task dependence and enhance optimization. Specifically, we introduce label embedding for each task to explicitly transfer the label information among these tasks, which can effectively explore logical task dependence. We also further design the gradient adjustment regime between the final regression task and other classification tasks to enhance the optimization. Extensive experiments on two offline public datasets and one real-world industrial dataset are conducted to validate the effectiveness of HTLNet. Moreover, online A/B tests on the financial recommender system also show our model has superior improvement.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Surrogate Switching: Sample-Efficient Search for Factorization Machine Configurations in Online Recommendations (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jure Ferlež, Adi Schwartz, Naama Ziporin, Blaz Skrlj</p>
    <p>Hyperparameter optimization is the process of identifying the appropriate hyperparameter configuration of a given machine learning model with regard to a given learning task. For smaller data sets, an exhaustive search is possible; However, when the data size and model complexity increase, the number of configuration evaluations becomes the main computational bottleneck. A promising paradigm for tackling this type of problem is surrogate-based optimization. The main idea underlying this paradigm considers an incrementally updated model of the relation between the hyperparameter space and the output (target) space; the data for this model are obtained by evaluating the main learning engine, which is, for example, a factorization machine-based model. By learning to approximate the hyperparameter-target relation, the surrogate (machine learning) model can be used to score large amounts of hyperparameter configurations, exploring parts of the configuration space beyond the reach of direct machine learning engine evaluation. Commonly, a surrogate is selected prior to optimization initialization and remains the same during the search. We investigated whether dynamic switching of surrogates during the optimization itself is a sensible idea of practical relevance for selecting the most appropriate factorization machine-based models for large-scale online recommendation. We conducted benchmarks on data sets containing hundreds of millions of instances against established baselines such as Random Forest- and Gaussian process-based surrogates. The results indicate that surrogate switching can offer good performance while considering fewer learning engine evaluations.</p>

    <h3>Fifty Shades of Ratings: How to Benefit from a Negative Feedback in Top-N Recommendations Tasks (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evgeny Frolov, Ivan Oseledets</p>
    <p>Conventional collaborative filtering techniques treat a top-n recommendations problem as a task of generating a list of the most relevant items. This formulation, however, disregards an opposite — avoiding recommendations with completely irrelevant items. Due to that bias, standard algorithms, as well as commonly used evaluation metrics, become insensitive to negative feedback. In order to resolve this problem we propose to treat user feedback as a categorical variable and model it with users and items in a ternary way. We employ a third-order tensor factorization technique and implement a higher order folding-in method to support online recommendations. The method is equally sensitive to entire spectrum of user ratings and is able to accurately predict relevant items even from a negative only feedback. Our method may partially eliminate the need for complicated rating elicitation process as it provides means for personalized recommendations from the very beginning of an interaction with a recommender system. We also propose a modification of standard metrics which helps to reveal unwanted biases and account for sensitivity to a negative feedback. Our model achieves state-of-the-art quality in standard recommendation tasks while significantly outperforming other methods in the cold-start “no-positive-feedback” scenarios.</p>
