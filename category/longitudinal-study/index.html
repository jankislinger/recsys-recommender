    <h3>Balancing Habit Repetition and New Activity Exploration: A Longitudinal Micro-Randomized Trial in Physical Activity Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ine Coppens, Luc Martens, Toon De Pessemier</p>
    <p>As repetition of activities can establish habits and exploration of new ones can provide a healthy variety, we investigate how a recommender system for physical activities can optimally balance these two approaches. We conducted an eight-week user study with 62 physically inactive participants who receive personalized repetition and exploration recommendations in a random order. We distinguish between location, workout, and general activities, and collect participants’ subjective perceptions. Our findings indicate that participants initially preferred exploring general activities, but rated repeating recommendations higher after two weeks. By exploring the optimal transition point from exploration to repetition in personalized recommendations, this study contributes to designing more effective recommender systems for health improvement and healthy habit formation.</p>

    <h3>Analyzing Accuracy versus Diversity in a Health Recommender System for Physical Activities: a Longitudinal User Study (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luc Martens, Toon De Pessemier, Ine Coppens</p>
    <p>As personalization has great potential to improve mobile health apps, analyzing the effect of different recommender algorithms in the health domain is still in its infancy. As such, this paper investigates whether more accurate recommendations from a content-based recommender or more diverse recommendations from a user-based collaborative filtering recommender will lead to more motivation to move. An eight-week longitudinal between-subject user study is being conducted with an Android app in which participants receive personalized recommendations for physical activities and tips to reduce sedentary behavior. The objective manipulation check confirmed that the group with collaborative filtering received significantly more diverse recommendations. The subjective manipulation check showed that the content-based group assigned more positive feedback for perceived accuracy and star rating to the recommendations they chose and executed. However, perceived diversity and inspiringness was significantly higher in the content-based group, suggesting that users might experience the recommendations differently. Lastly, momentary motivation for the executed activities and tips was significantly higher in the content-based group. As such, the preliminary results of this longitudinal study suggest that more accurate and less diverse recommendations have better effects on motivating users to move more.</p>

    <h3>How Should We Measure Filter Bubbles? A Regression Model and Evidence for Online News (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Verachtert, Jens Leysen, Annelien Smets, Jorre Vannieuwenhuyze, Lien Michiels, Bart Goethals</p>
    <p>News media play an important role in democratic societies.  Central to fulfilling this role is the premise that users should be exposed to diverse news.  However, news recommender systems are gaining popularity on news websites, which has sparked concerns over filter bubbles. Editors, policy-makers and scholars are worried that news recommender systems may expose users to less diverse content over time.  To the best of our knowledge, this hypothesis has not been tested in a longitudinal observational study of real users that interact with a real news website. Such observational studies require the use of research methods that are robust and can account for the many covariates that may influence the diversity of recommendations at any given time. In this work, we propose an analysis model to study whether the variety of articles recommended to a user decreases over time, in observational studies of real news websites with real users. Further, we present results from two case studies using aggregated and anonymized data that were collected by two western European news websites employing a collaborative filtering-based news recommender system to serve (personalized) recommendations to their users. Through these case studies we validate empirically that our modeling assumptions are sound and supported by the data, and that our model obtains more reliable and interpretable results than analysis methods used in prior empirical work on filter bubbles. Our case studies provide evidence of a small decrease in the topic variety of a user’s recommendations in the first weeks after they sign up, but no evidence of a decrease in political variety.</p>

    <h3>Exploring the longitudinal effect of nudging on users’ genre exploration behavior and listening preference (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martijn C. Willemsen, Yu Liang</p>
    <p>Previous studies on exploration have shown that users can be nudged to explore further away from their current preferences. However, these effects were shown in a single session study, while it often takes time to explore new tastes and develop new preferences. In this work, we present a longitudinal study on users’ exploration behavior and behavior change over time after they have used a music genre exploration tool for four sessions in six weeks. We test two relevant nudges to help them explore more: the starting point (the personalization of the default initial playlist) and the visualization of users’ previous position(s). Our results show that the personalization level of the default initial playlist in the first session influences the preferred personalization level users set in the second session but fades away in later sessions as users start exploring in different directions. Visualization of users’ previous positions did not anchor users to stay closer to the initial defaults. Over time, users perceived the playlist to be more personalized to their tastes and helpful to explore the genre. Perceived helpfulness increased more when users explored further away from their current preferences. Apart from differences in self-reported measures, we also find some objective evidence for preference change in users’ top tracks from their Spotify profile, that over the period of 6 weeks moved somewhat closer to the genre that users selected to explore with the tool.</p>
