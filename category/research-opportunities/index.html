    <h3>Challenges in Translating Research to Practice for Evaluating Fairness and Bias in Recommendation Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan Taber, Lex Beattie, Henriette Cramer</p>
    <p>Calls to action to implement evaluation of fairness and bias into industry systems are increasing at a rapid rate. The research community has attempted to meet these demands by producing ethical principles and guidelines for AI, but few of these documents provide guidance on how to implement these principles in real world settings. Without readily available standardized and practice-tested approaches for evaluating fairness in recommendation systems, industry practitioners, who are often not experts, may easily run into challenges or implement metrics that are potentially poorly suited to their specific applications. When evaluating recommendations, practitioners are well aware they should evaluate their systems for unintended algorithmic harms, but the most important, and unanswered question, is how? In this talk, we will present practical challenges we encountered in addressing algorithmic responsibility in recommendation systems, which also present research opportunities for the RecSys community. This talk will focus on the steps that need to happen before bias mitigation can even begin.</p>

    <h3>Towards a Recommender System for Undergraduate Research (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Del Rio, Denis Parra, Erick Svec, Jovan Kuzmicic</p>
    <p>Several studies indicate that attracting students to research careers requires to engage them from early undergraduate years. Following this, the Engineering School at PUC Chile has developed an undergraduate research program that allows students to enroll in research in exchange for course credits. Moreover, we developed a web portal to inform students about the program, but participation remains lower than expected. In order to promote student engagement, we attempt to build a personalized recommender system of research opportunities to undergraduates. With this goal in mind we investigate two tasks. First, identifying students that are more willing to participate on this kind of program. A second task is generating a personalized list of recommendations of research opportunities for each student. To evaluate our approach, we perform a simulated prediction experiment with data from our school, which has more than 4,000 active undergraduate students nowadays. Results indicate that there is a big potential to create a personalized recommender system for this purpose. Our research can be used as a baseline for colleges seeking strategies to encourage research activities within undergraduate students.</p>
