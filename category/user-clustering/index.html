    <h3>Exploring Clustering of Bandits for Online Recommendation System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Xia, Qiang Yang, Bo Liu, Kai Chen, Leyu Lin, Liu Yang</p>
    <p>Cluster-of-bandit policy leverages contextual bandits in a collaborative filtering manner and aids personalized services in the online recommendation system (RecSys). When facing insufficient observations, the cluster-of-bandit policy could achieve more outstanding performance because of knowledge sharing. Cluster-of-bandit policy aims to maximize the cumulative feedback, e.g., clicks, from users. Nevertheless, in the way of their goal exist two kinds of uncertainties. First, cluster-of-bandit algorithms make recommendations according to their uncertain estimation of user interests. Second, cluster-of-bandit algorithms transfer relevant knowledge upon uncertain and noisy user clusters. Existing algorithms only consider the first one, while leaving the latter one untouched. To address the two challenges together, in this paper, we propose the ClexB policy for online RecSys. On the one hand, ClexB estimates user clustering more accurately and with less uncertainty via explorable-clustering. On the other hand, ClexB also exploits and explores user interests by sharing information within and among user clusters. In summary, ClexB explores knowledge transfer and further aids the inferences about user interests. Besides, we provide extensive empirical experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets and regret analysis, further consolidating the superiority of ClexB.</p>

    <h3>Additive Co-Clustering with Social Influence for Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liping Jing, Huafeng Liu, Xixi Du</p>
    <p>Recommender system is a popular tool to accurately and actively provide users with potentially interesting information. For capturing the usersâ€™ preferences and approximating the missing data, matrix completion and approximation are widely adopted. Except for the typical low-rank factorization-based methods, the additive co-clustering approach (ACCAMS) is recently proposed to succinctly approximate large-scale rating matrix. Although ACCAMS efficiently produces effective recommendation result, it still suffers from the cold-start problem. To address this issue, we propose a Social Influence Additive Co-Clustering method (SIACC) by making use of user-item rating data and user-user social relations. The main idea of SIACC is to extract the social influences from the social network, integrate them to additive co-clustering for effectively determining the user clusters and item clusters, minimize the loss error by backfitting the residuals of data approximation in the previous iteration, and finally improve the recommendation performance. In order to take advantage of social influence, we present a graph-regularized weighted-Fuzzy C-Means algorithm (gwFCM) to cluster users. gwFCM has ability to identify user groups from both rating and social information. Specifically, gwFCM makes sure that a pair of users have similar cluster membership if they have direct social relation (denoted as local social influence), and that the user with higher reputation (denoted as global social influence) plays a dominate role in clustering process. The reasonable user clusters obtained by gwFCM can benefit the item clustering, which will leverage the additive co-clustering processing and further improve the recommendation performance. A series of experiments on three real-world datasets have shown that SIACC outperforms the existing popular recommendation methods (PMF and ACCAMS) and social recommendation methods (SoReg, TrustMF, Locabal and SPF), especially on the cold-start users recommendation and running time.</p>
