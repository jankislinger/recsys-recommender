    <h3>“More to Read” at the Los Angeles Times: Solving a Cold Start Problem with LLMs to Improve Story Discovery (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Kaufman, Franklin Horn, Aurelia Alston, Won You</p>
    <p>News publishers, who are seeking to grow their digital audience, face a challenge in providing relevant content recommendations for unregistered users arriving directly to article pages. In these cold start scenarios, classic techniques, like asking a user to register and select topics of interest, fall short. We present a contextual targeting approach that leverages the user’s current article choice itself as an implicit signal of user interests. We designed and developed an interface with recommendations to help users discover more articles. Our online A/B testing demonstrated that our models increased click-through rates by 39.4% over a popularity baseline. One of them, a large language model (LLM), generates relevant recommendations that balance immersion and novelty. We discuss the implications of using LLMs for responsibly enhancing user experiences while upholding editorial standards. We identify key opportunities in detecting nuanced user preferences and identifying and interrupting filter bubbles on news publisher sites.</p>

    <h3>It’s (not) all about that CTR: A Multi-Stakeholder Perspective on News Recommender Metrics (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanne Vandenbroucke, Annelien Smets</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems are increasingly adopted by news media organizations. Existing literature examines various aspects of news recommendation systems (NRS) from a computational, user-centric, or normative perspective. Yet, scholars have argued to study the complexity of real-world applications surrounding the development and evaluation of NRS. More specifically, understand why different stakeholders within the organization prioritize different values for developing NRS and how those values are operationalized into metrics. Recently, a multi-stakeholder approach to NRS has been adopted, allowing to capture this complexity more comprehensively. However, limited research has focused on the distinct key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics considered valuable by different stakeholders in evaluating NRS. Based on 11 interviews conducted with different professionals from two commercial media organizations in Flanders and The Netherlands, this paper shows that stakeholders prioritize different KPIs and metrics related to the reach-engagement-conversion-retention funnel. The evaluation of NRS performance is often limited to short-term metrics like CTR, overlooking the multiplicity of stakeholders involved. Our findings reveal how different purposes, KPIs, and metrics are valued from the journalistic, commercial, and tech logic. In doing so, this paper contributes to the multi-stakeholder approach to NRS, advancing our understanding of the real-world complexity of NRS development and evaluation.</p>

    <h3>Towards Open-World Recommendation with Knowledge Augmentation from Large Language Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiwen Liu, Bo Chen, Yong Yu, Hong Zhu, Yunjia Xi, Weinan Zhang, Jianghao Lin, Xiaoling Cai, Jieming Zhu, Ruiming Tang</p>
    <p>Recommender system plays a vital role in various online services. However, its insulated nature of training and deploying separately within a specific closed domain limits its access to open-world knowledge. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in bridging this gap by encoding extensive world knowledge and demonstrating reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, previous attempts to directly use LLMs as recommenders cannot meet the inference latency demand of industrial recommender systems. In this work, we propose an Open-World Knowledge Augmented Recommendation Framework with Large Language Models, dubbed KAR, to acquire two types of external knowledge from LLMs — the reasoning knowledge on user preferences and the factual knowledge on items. We introduce factorization prompting to elicit accurate reasoning on user preferences. The generated reasoning and factual knowledge are effectively transformed and condensed into augmented vectors by a hybrid-expert adaptor in order to be compatible with the recommendation task. The obtained vectors can then be directly used to enhance the performance of any recommendation model. We also ensure efficient inference by preprocessing and prestoring the knowledge from the LLM. Extensive experiments show that KAR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and is compatible with a wide range of recommendation algorithms. We deploy KAR to Huawei’s news and music recommendation platforms and gain a 7% and 1.7% improvement in the online A/B test, respectively.</p>

    <h3>Deliberative Diversity for News Recommendations: Operationalization and Experimental User Study (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rana Abdullah, Juliane A. Lischka, Laura Laugwitz, Lucien Heitz, Hendrik Meyer, Abraham Bernstein</p>
    <p>News recommender systems are an increasingly popular field of study that attracts a growing, interdisciplinary research community. As these systems play an important role in our daily lives, the mechanisms behind their curation processes are under close scrutiny. In the domain of personalized news, many platforms make design choices that are driven by economic incentives. In contrast to such systems that optimize for financial gains, there exists norm-driven diversity objectives, putting normative and democratic goals first. Their impact on users, however, in terms of triggering behavioral changes or affecting knowledgeability, is still under-researched. In this paper, we contribute to the field of news recommender system design by conducting a user study that looks at the impact of these normative approaches. We a.) operationalize the notion of deliberative democracy for news recommendations, show b.) the impact on political knowledgeability and c.) the influence on voting behavior. We found that exposure to small parties is associated with an increase in knowledge about their candidates and that intensive news consumption about a party can change the direction of attitudes towards their issues.</p>

    <h3>Transformers4Rec: Bridging the Gap between NLP and Sequential / Session-Based Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ronay Ak, Even Oldridge, Sara Rabhi, Gabriel de Souza Pereira Moreira, Jeong Min Lee</p>
    <p>Much of the recent progress in sequential and session-based recommendation has been driven by improvements in model architecture and pretraining techniques originating in the field of Natural Language Processing. Transformer architectures in particular have facilitated building higher-capacity models and provided data augmentation and training techniques which demonstrably improve the effectiveness of sequential recommendation. But with a thousandfold more research going on in NLP, the application of transformers for recommendation understandably lags behind. To remedy this we introduce Transformers4Rec, an open-source library built upon HuggingFace’s Transformers library with a similar goal of opening up the advances of NLP based Transformers to the recommender system community and making these advancements immediately accessible for the tasks of sequential and session-based recommendation. Like its core dependency, Transformers4Rec is designed to be extensible by researchers, simple for practitioners, and fast and robust in industrial deployments.<br>In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the library and the applicability of Transformer architectures in next-click prediction for user sessions, where sequence lengths are much shorter than those commonly found in NLP, we have leveraged Transformers4Rec to win two recent session-based recommendation competitions. In addition, we present in this paper the first comprehensive empirical analysis comparing many Transformer architectures and training approaches for the task of session-based recommendation. We demonstrate that the best Transformer architectures have superior performance across two e-commerce datasets while performing similarly to the baselines on two news datasets. We further evaluate in isolation the effectiveness of the different training techniques used in causal language modeling, masked language modeling, permutation language modeling and replacement token detection for a single Transformer architecture, XLNet. We establish that training XLNet with replacement token detection performs well across all datasets. Finally, we explore techniques to include side information such as item and user context features in order to establish best practices and show that the inclusion of side information uniformly improves recommendation performance.

    <h3>Modeling Users and Items for Recommenders: There Is More than Semantics (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mete Sertkan</p>
    <p>Recommender systems aim to help us to take better decisions and thus to save resources and increase satisfaction. Personalized recommendations are their main asset. In some domains, such as tourism or news, recommender systems rely more on content-based approaches to give personalized recommendations, due to domain-specific challenges. Content-based methods tend to recommend items semantically similar to the users’ previous consumptions. However, the content of items (e.g., text, visuals, categories, etc.) usually contains more than semantic properties.<br>In this PhD work we focus on the multifaceted nature of the recommendation items. Besides the mentioned semantic properties, we also take into account visual and textual style elements and more complex concepts such as emotions and personality. Our aim is to address people also on a non-rational, non-verbal, and rather emotional level; and thus, to improve recommendations. We propose a statistical-learning-based characterization of items, a picture-based approach to profile users and items, and a neural end-to-end approach, where we learn to represent users and items, and simultaneously to recommend. In all of the proposed methods we consider in addition to the semantic content either stylistic elements and/or more complex concepts like personality, and observe their impact. To contribute the community, we plan to open source our code and the datasets (to the extent our collaborators agree).</p>

    <h3>Interactive Recommendation via Deep Neural Memory Augmented Contextual Bandits (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Deng, Avik Ray, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin</p>
    <p>Personalized recommendation with user interactions has become increasingly popular nowadays in many applications with dynamic change of contents (news, media, etc.). Existing approaches model user interactive recommendation as a contextual bandit problem to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. However, these solutions require a large number of interactions with each user to provide high quality personalized recommendations. To mitigate this limitation, we design a novel deep neural memory augmented mechanism to model and track the history state for each user based on his previous interactions. As such, the user’s preferences on new items can be quickly learned within a small number of interactions. Moreover, we develop new algorithms to leverage large amount of all users’ history data for offline model training and online model fine tuning for each user with the focus of policy evaluation. Extensive experiments on different synthetic and real-world datasets validate that our proposed approach consistently outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

    <h3>StreamingRec: A Framework for Benchmarking Stream-based News Recommenders (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Michael Jugovac, Mozhgan Karimi</p>
    <p>News is one of the earliest application domains of recommender systems, and recommending items from a virtually endless stream of news is still a relevant problem today. News recommendation is different from other application domains in a variety of ways, e.g., because new items constantly become available for recommendation. To be effective, news recommenders therefore have to continuously consider the latest items in the incoming stream of news in their recommendation models. However, today’s public software libraries for algorithm benchmarking mostly do not consider these particularities of the domain. As a result, authors often rely on proprietary protocols, which hampers the comparability of the obtained results. In this paper, we present StreamingRec as a framework for evaluating streaming-based news recommenders in a replicable way. The open-source framework implements a replay-based evaluation protocol that allows algorithms to update the underlying models in real-time when new events are recorded and new articles are available for recommendation. Furthermore, a variety of baseline algorithms for session-based recommendation are part of StreamingRec. For these, we also report a number of performance results for two datasets, which confirm the importance of immediate model updates.</p>

    <h3>Predicting Online Performance of News Recommender Systems Through Richer Evaluation Metrics (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boi Faltings, Florent Garcin, Andrii Maksai</p>
    <p>We investigate how metrics that can be measured offine can be used to predict the online performance of recommender systems, thus avoiding costly A-B testing. In addition to accuracy metrics, we combine diversity, coverage, and serendipity metrics to create a new performance model. Using the model, we quantify the trade-off between different metrics and propose to use it to tune the parameters of recommender algorithms without the need for online testing. Another application for the model is a self-adjusting algorithm blend that optimizes a recommender’s parameters over time. We evaluate our findings on data and experiments from news websites.</p>

    <h3>Cold-start News Recommendation with Domain-dependent Browse Graph (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Trevisiol, Rossano Schifanella, Luca Maria Aiello, Alejandro Jaimes</p>
    <p>Online social networks and mash-up services create opportunities to connect different web services otherwise isolated. Specifically in the case of news, users are very much exposed to news articles while performing other activities, such as social networking or web searching. Browsing behaviour aimed to the consumption of news, especially in relation to the visits coming from other domains, has been mainly overlooked in previous work. To address that, we build a BrowseGraph out of the collective browsing traces extracted from a large viewlog of Yahoo News (0.5B entries) and we define the ReferrerGraph as its subgraph induced by the sessions with the same referrer domain. The structural and temporal properties of the graph show that browsing behavior in news is highly dependent on the referrer URL of the session, in terms of type of content consumed and time of consumption. We build on this observation and propose a news recommender that addresses the cold-start problem: given a user landing on a page of the site for the first time, we aim to predict the page she will visit next. We compare 24 flavors of recommenders belonging to the families of content-based, popularity-based, and browsing-based models. We show that the browsing-based recommender that take into account the referrer URL is the best performing, achieving a prediction accuracy of 61% in conditions of heavy data sparsity.</p>
