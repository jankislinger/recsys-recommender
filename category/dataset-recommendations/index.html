    <h3>Reproducibility and Analysis of Scientific Dataset Recommendation Methods (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianmaria Silvello, Matteo Lissandrini, Ornella Irrera, Daniele Dell’Aglio</p>
    <p>Datasets play a central role in scholarly communications. However, scholarly graphs are often incomplete, particularly due to the lack of connections between publications and datasets. Therefore, the importance of dataset recommendation—identifying relevant datasets for a scientific paper, an author, or a textual query—is increasing. Although various methods have been proposed for this task, their reproducibility remains unexplored, making it difficult to compare them with new approaches. We reviewed current recommendation methods for scientific datasets, focusing on the most recent and competitive approaches,  including an SVM-based model, a bi-encoder retriever, a method leveraging co-authors and citation network embeddings, and a heterogeneous variational graph autoencoder.  These approaches underwent a comprehensive analysis under consistent experimental conditions. Our reproducibility efforts show that three methods can be reproduced, while the graph variational autoencoder is challenging due to unavailable code and test datasets.  Hence, we re-implemented this method and performed a component-based analysis to examine its strengths and limitations. Furthermore, our study indicated that three out of four considered methods produce subpar results when applied to real-world data instead of specialized datasets with ad-hoc features.</p>

    <h3>Do Users Matter? The Contribution of User-Driven Feature Weights to Open Dataset Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anusuriya Devaraju, Shlomo Berkovsky</p>
    <p>The vast volumes of open data pose a challenge for users in finding relevant datasets. To address this, we developed a hybrid dataset recommendation model that combines content-based similarity with item-to-item co-occurrence. The features used by the recommender include dataset properties and usage statistics. In this paper, we focus on fi ne-tuning the weights of these features. We experimentally compare two feature weighting approaches: a uniform one with predefined weights and a user-driven one, where the weights are informed by the opinions of system users. We evaluated the two approaches in a study, involving the users of a real-life data portal. The results suggest that user-driven feature weights can improve dataset recommendations, although not at all levels of data relevance, and highlight the importance of incorporating target users in the design of recommender systems.</p>
