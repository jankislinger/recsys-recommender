    <h3>Traversing Semantically Annotated Queries for Task-oriented Query Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Câmara, Rodrygo L. T. Santos</p>
    <p>As search systems gradually turn into intelligent personal assistants, users increasingly resort to a search engine to accomplish a complex task, such as planning a trip, renting an apartment, or investing in stocks. A key challenge for the search engine is to understand the user’s underlying task given a sample query like ‘tickets to panama’, ‘studios in los angeles’, or ‘spotify stocks’, and to suggest other queries to help the user complete the task. In this paper, we investigate several strategies for query recommendation by traversing a semantically annotated query log using a mixture of explicit and latent representations of entire queries and of query segments. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in terms of utility and diversity, as well as their complementarity, with significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art query recommendation baselines adapted for this task. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Semantic-based Tag Recommendation in Scientific Bookmarking Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hebatallah A. Mohamed Hassan</p>
    <p>Recently, tagging has become a common way for users to organize and share digital content, and tag recommendation (TR) has become a very important research topic. Most of the recommendation approaches which are based on text embedding have utilized bag-of-words technique. On the other hand, proposed deep learning methods for capturing semantic meanings in the text, have been proved to be effective in various natural language processing (NLP) applications. In this paper, we present a content-based TR method that adopts deep recurrent neural networks to encode titles and abstracts of scientific articles into semantic vectors for enhancing the recommendation task, specifically bidirectional gated recurrent units (bi-GRUs) with attention mechanism. The experimental evaluation is performed on a dataset from CiteULike. The overall findings show that the proposed model is effective in representing scientific articles for tag recommendation.</p>

    <h3>SemRevRec: A Recommender System based on User Reviews and Linked Data (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Monti, Iacopo Vagliano, Maurizio Morisio</p>
    <p>Traditionally, recommender systems exploit user ratings to infer preferences. However, the growing popularity of social platforms has encouraged users to write textual reviews about liked items. These reviews represent a valuable source of non-trivial information that could improve users’ decision processes. In this paper we propose a novel recommendation approach based on the semantic annotation of entities mentioned in user reviews and on the knowledge available in the Web of Data. We compared our recommender system with two baseline algorithms and a state-of-the-art Linked Data based approach. Our system provided more diverse recommendations with respect to the other techniques considered, while obtaining a better accuracy than the Linked Data based method.</p>

    <h3>T-RecS: A Framework for a Temporal Semantic Analysis of the ACM Recommender Systems Conference (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Lops, Fedelucio Narducci, Marco De Gemmis, Giovanni Semeraro, Pierpaolo Basile</p>
    <p>This paper presents T-RecS (Temporal analysis of Recommender Systems conference proceedings), a framework that supplies services to analyze the Recommender Systems Conference proceedings from the first edition, held in 2007, to the last one, held in 2015, under a temporal point of view. The idea behind T-RecS is to identify linguistic phenomena that reflect some interesting variations for the research community, such as topic drift, or how the correlation between two terms changed over time, or how similarity between two authors evolved over time. The implemented framework can be easily adapted for the analysis of different corpora and domains.</p>

    <h3>Topical Semantic Recommendations for Auteur Films (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Till Plumbaum, Andreas Lommatzsch, Christian Rakow</p>
    <p>With the ubiquity of fast internet connections and the growing availability of Video-On-Demand (VOD) services powerful recommender systems are needed. Traditionally, movie recommender systems apply user-based collaborative filtering providing high quality recommendations if users maintain user profiles describing preferences and movie ratings. The shortcomings of Collaborative Filtering are that comprehensive user profiles are required and users tend to get recommendations very similar to the user profile (filter bubble). In addition, CF-based recommenders neither consider current trends nor the context. In order to overcome these weaknesses, we develop a system identifying interesting events in the stream of current news and deploying this information for computing recommendations. Our system gathers topics of interest from Twitter and RSS-Feeds, extracts relevant Named Entities, and uses semantic relations for recommending movies closely related to these topics. We explain the used algorithms and show that our system provides highly relevant recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Image Discovery and Insertion for Custom Publishing (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerry Liu, Shanchan Wu, Lei Liu</p>
    <p>Images in reading materials make the content come alive. Aside from providing additional information to the text, reading material containing illustration engages our spatial memory, increases memory retention of the material. However, despite the plethora of available multimedia, adding illustrations to text continues to be a difficult task for the amateur content publisher. To address this problem, we present a semantic-aware image discovery and insertion system for custom publishing. Compared to image search engines, our system has the advantage of being able to discern among different topics within a long text passage and recommend the most relevant images for each detected topic with semantic “visual words” based relevance.</p>
