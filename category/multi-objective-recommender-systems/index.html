    <h3>Reproducibility of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning Recommendation: Interplay between Effectiveness and Beyond-Accuracy Perspectives (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Paparella, Ludovico Boratto, Vito Walter Anelli, Tommaso Di Noia</p>
    <p>Providing effective suggestions is of predominant importance for successful Recommender Systems (RSs). Nonetheless, the need of accounting for additional multiple objectives has become prominent, from both the final users’ and the item providers’ points of view. This need has led to a new class of RSs, called Multi-Objective Recommender Systems (MORSs). These systems are designed to provide suggestions by considering multiple (conflicting) objectives simultaneously, such as diverse, novel, and fairness-aware recommendations. In this work, we reproduce a state-of-the-art study on MORSs that exploits a reinforcement learning agent to satisfy three objectives, i.e., accuracy, diversity, and novelty of recommendations. The selected study is one of the few MORSs where the source code and datasets are released to ensure the reproducibility of the proposed approach. Interestingly, we find that some challenges arise when replicating the results of the original work, due to the nature of multiple-objective problems. We also extend the evaluation of the approach to analyze the impact of improving user-centred objectives of recommendations (i.e., diversity and novelty) in terms of algorithmic bias. To this end, we take into consideration both popularity and category of the items. We discover some interesting trends in the recommendation performance according to different evaluation metrics. In addition, we see that the multi-objective reinforcement learning approach is responsible for increasing the bias disparity in the output of the recommendation algorithm for those items belonging to positively/negatively biased categories. We publicly release datasets and codes in the following GitHub repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MORS_reproducibility-BD60</p>
