    <h3>Using Learnable Physics for Real-Time Exercise Form Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gautam Chauhan, Abhishek Jaiswal, Nisheeth Srivastava</p>
    <p>Good posture and form are essential for safe and productive exercising. Even in gym settings, trainers may not be readily available for feedback. Rehabilitation therapies and fitness workouts can thus benefit from recommender systems that provide real-time evaluation. In this paper, we present an algorithmic pipeline that can diagnose problems in exercises technique and offer corrective recommendations, with high sensitivity and specificity, in real-time. We use MediaPipe for pose recognition, count repetitions using peak-prominence detection, and use a learnable physics simulator to track motion evolution for each exercise. A test video is diagnosed based on deviations from the prototypical learned motion using statistical learning. The system is evaluated on six full and upper body exercises. These real-time interactive suggestions counseled via low-cost equipment like smartphones will allow exercisers to rectify potential mistakes making self-practice feasible while reducing the risk of workout injuries.</p>

    <h3>Aligning Daily Activities with Personality: Towards A Recommender System for Improving Wellbeing (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandar Matic, Miquel Ferrer, A. Aldo Faisal, Jesus Omana Iglesias, Mohammed Khwaja</p>
    <p>Recommender Systems have not been explored to a great extent for improving health and subjective wellbeing. Recent advances in mobile technologies and user modelling present the opportunity for delivering such systems, however the key issue is understanding the drivers of subjective wellbeing at an individual level. In this paper we propose a novel approach for deriving personalized activity recommendations to improve subjective wellbeing by maximizing the congruence between activities and personality traits. To evaluate the model, we leveraged a rich dataset collected in a smartphone study, which contains three weeks of daily activity probes, the Big-Five personality questionnaire and subjective wellbeing surveys. We show that the model correctly infers a range of activities that are ‘good’ or ‘bad’ (i.e. that are positively or negatively related to subjective wellbeing) for a given user and that the derived recommendations greatly match outcomes in the real-world. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Pace My Race: Recommendations for Marathon Running (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barry Smyth, Aonghus Lawlor, Jakim Berndsen</p>
    <p>We propose marathon running as a novel domain for recommender systems and machine learning. Using high-resolution marathon performance data from multiple marathon races (n=7931), we build in-race recommendations for runners. We show that we can outperform the existing techniques which are currently employed for in-race finish-time prediction, and we demonstrate how such predictions may be used to make real time recommendations to runners. The recommendations are made at critical points in the race to provide personalised guidance so the runner can adjust their race strategy. Through the association of model features and the expert domain knowledge of marathon runners we generate explainable, adaptable pacing recommendations which can guide runners to their best possible finish time and help them avoid the potentially catastrophic effects of hitting the wall.</p>
