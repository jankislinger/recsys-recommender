    <h3>Co-optimize Content Generation and Consumption in a Large Scale Video Recommendation System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuening Li, Mingyan Gao, Qingyun Liu, Sourabh Bansod, Shuchao Bi, Liang Liu, Yaping Zhang, Zhen Zhang</p>
    <p>Multi-task prediction models and value models are the de-facto standard ranking components in modern large-scale content recommendation systems. However, they are typically optimized to model users’ passive consumption behaviors, and rank content in a way to grow only consumption-centric values. In this talk, we discuss the key insight that it is possible to model sparse participatory content-generation actions as well and grow ecosystem value through a new ranking system. We made the following key technical contributions in this system: (1) introducing ranking for content generation based on a categorization of user participation actions of different sparsity, including proxy intent action or access point clicks. (2) improving sparse task prediction quality and stability by causal task relationship modeling, conditional loss modeling and ResNet based shared bottom network. (3) personalizing the value model to minimize conflicts between different values, through e.g. ranking inspiring content higher for users who actively generate content. (4) conducting systematic evaluation of proposed approach in a large short-form video UGC (User-Generated Content) platform.</p>

    <h3>Question Recommendation with Constraints for Massive Open Online Courses (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Adamson, Diyi Yang, Carolyn Rose</p>
    <p>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have experienced a recent boom in interest. Although the number of students that have registered for MOOCs is remarkably high, the fraction of those who actively participate in course discussion forums is startlingly low. By recommending relevant forum discussions and questions to students, their engagement and participation may increase, to the benefit of both the student and the course community. This problem has not been thoroughly explored by existing recommender systems. In contrast to traditional product recommendation, question recommendation in discussion forums should consider constraints on both students and questions. These considerations include (1)Load Balancing – students should not be over-burdened with too many requests; and (2) Expertise Matching – matching students’ abilities to the difficulty of unanswered questions, which in turn positions students to contribute meaningfully to the forum. In this work, we propose a novel constrained question recommendation problem to address the above considerations, with the intent to improve the learning experience for course participants. We first design a context-aware matrix factorization model to predict students’ preferences over questions, then build a max cost flow model to address the constraints. Experimental results on three MOOC datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods in optimizing overall forum welfare, and in predicting which questions students might be interested in.</p>
