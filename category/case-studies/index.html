    <h3>Recommender Systems and Algorithmic Hate (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Burke, Lucia Jayne, Jessie Smith</p>
    <p>Despite increasing reliance on personalization in digital platforms, many algorithms that curate content or information for users have been met with resistance. When users feel dissatisfied or harmed by recommendations, this can lead users to hate, or feel negatively towards these personalized systems. Algorithmic hate detrimentally impacts both users and the system, and can result in various forms of algorithmic harm, or in extreme cases can lead to public protests against “the algorithm” in question. In this work, we summarize some of the most common causes of algorithmic hate and their negative consequences through various case studies of personalized recommender systems. We explore promising future directions for the RecSys research community that could help alleviate algorithmic hate and improve the relationship between recommender systems and their users.</p>

    <h3>Evaluation Framework for Cold-Start Techniques in Large-Scale Production Settings (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moran Haham</p>
    <p>In recommender systems, cold-start issues are situations where no previous events (e.g., ratings), are known for certain users or items. Mitigating cold-start situations is a fundamental problem in almost any recommender system [3, 5]. In real-life, large-scale production systems, the challenge of optimizing the cold-start strategy is even greater. We present an end-to-end framework for evaluating and comparing different cold-start strategies. By applying this framework in Outbrain’s recommender system, we were able to reduce our cold-start costs by half, while supporting both offline and online settings. Our framework solves the pain of benchmarking numerous cold-start techniques using surrogate accuracy metrics on offline datasets - coupled with an extensive, cost-controlled online A/B test. In this abstract, We’ll start with a short introduction to the cold-start challenge in recommender systems. Next, we will explain the motivation for a framework for cold-start techniques. Lastly, we will then describe - step by step - how we used the framework to reduce our exploration by more than 50%.</p>

    <h3>Learning Representations of Hierarchical Slates in Collaborative Filtering (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashok Chandrashekar, Ehtsham Elahi</p>
    <p>We are interested in building collaborative filtering models for recommendation systems where users interact with slates instead of individual items. These slates can be hierarchical in nature. The central idea of our approach is to learn low dimensional embeddings of these slates. We present a novel way to learn these embeddings by making use of the (unknown) statistics of the underlying distribution generating the hierarchical data. Our representation learning algorithm can be viewed as a simple composition rule that can be applied recursively in a bottom-up fashion to represent arbitrarily complex hierarchical structures in terms of the representations of its constituent components. We demonstrate our ideas on two real world recommendation systems datasets including the one used for the RecSys 2019 challenge. For that dataset, we improve upon the performance achieved by the winning team’s model by incorporating embeddings as features generated by our approach in their solution.</p>

    <h3>RecSysOps: Best Practices for Operating a Large-Scale Recommender System (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Saberian</p>
    <p>Ensuring the health of a modern large-scale recommendation system is a very challenging problem. To address this, we need to put in place proper logging, sophisticated exploration policies, develop ML-interpretability tools or even train new ML models to predict/detect issues of the main production model. In this talk, we shine a light on this less-discussed but important area and share some of the best practices, called RecSysOps, that we’ve learned while operating our increasingly complex recommender systems at Netflix. RecSysOps is a set of best practices for identifying issues and gaps as well as diagnosing and resolving them in a large-scale machine-learned recommender system. RecSysOps helped us to 1) reduce production issues and 2) increase recommendation quality by identifying areas of improvement and 3) make it possible to bring new innovations faster to our members by enabling us to spend more of our time on new innovations and less on debugging and firefighting issues.</p>

    <h3>Defining and Supporting Narrative-driven Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marijn Koolen, Toine Bogers</p>
    <p>Research into recommendation algorithms has made great strides in recent years. However, these algorithms are typically applied in relatively straightforward scenarios: given information about a user’s past preferences, what will they like in the future? Recommendation is often more complex, however: evaluating recommended items never takes place in a vacuum, and it is often a single step in the user’s more complex background task. In this paper, we define a specific type of recommendation scenario called narrative-driven recommendation, where the recommendation process is driven by both a log of the user’s past transactions as well as a narrative description of their current interest(s). Through an analysis of a set of real-world recommendation narratives from the LibraryThing forums, we demonstrate the uniqueness and richness of this  scenario and highlight common patterns and properties of such narratives.</p>

    <h3>Crowd Sourcing, with a Few Answers: Recommending Commuters for Traffic Updates (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Berlingerio, François Schnitzler, Elizabeth M. Daly</p>
    <p>Real-time traffic awareness applications are playing an ever increasing role understanding and tackling traffic congestion in cities. First-hand accounts from drivers witnessing an incident is an invaluable source of information for traffic managers. Nowadays, drivers increasingly contact control rooms through social media to report on journey times, accidents or road weather conditions. These new interactions allow traffic controllers to engage users, and in particular to query them for information rather than passively collecting it. Querying articipants presents the challenge of which users to probe for updates about a specific situation. In order to maximise the probability of a user responding and the accuracy of the information, we propose a strategy which takes into account the engagement levels of the user, the mobility profile and the reputation of the user. We provide an analysis of a real-world user corpus of Twitter users contributing updates to LiveDrive, a Dublin based traffic radio station.</p>
