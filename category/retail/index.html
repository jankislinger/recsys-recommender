    <h3>Tops, Bottoms, and Shoes: Building Capsule Wardrobes via Cross-Attention Tensor Network (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Yang, Fei Wang, Yusan Lin, Huiyuan Chen</p>
    <p>Fashion is more than Paris runways. Fashion is about how people express their interests, identity, mood, and cultural influences. Given an inventory of candidate garments from different categories, how to assemble them together would most improve their fashionability? This question presents an intriguing visual recommendation challenge to automatically create capsule wardrobes. Capsule wardrobe generation is a complex combinatorial problem that requires the understanding of how multiple visual items interact. The generative process often needs fashion experts to manually tease the combinations out, making it hard to scale.<br>We introduce TensorNet, an approach that captures the key ingredients of visual compatibility among tops, bottoms, and shoes. TensorNet aims to provide actionable advice for full-body clothing outfits that mix and match well. Our TensorNet consists of two core modules: a Cross-Attention Message Passing module and a Wide&Deep Tensor Interaction module. As such, TensorNet is able to characterize the local region-based patterns as well as the global compatibility of the entire outfits. Our experimental results on the real-word datasets indicate that the proposed method is capable of learning visual compatibility and outperforms all the baselines. TensorNet opens up opportunities for fashion designers to narrow down the search space for multi-clothes combinations.</p>

    <h3>In-Store Augmented Reality-Enabled Product Comparison and Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jürgen Ziegler, Jesús Omar Álvarez Márquez</p>
    <p>We present an approach combining the AR-based presentation of product attributes in a physical retail store with recommendations for items only available online. The system supports users’ decision-making process by offering functions for comparing product features between items, both physical and online, and by providing recommendations based on selecting in-store products. The physical products may thus serve as anchors for forming the user’s preferences, also offering a richer and more engaging experience when exploring the products hands-on. Both objective product attributes as well as the visual appearance of a physical product are employed for generating recommendations from the online space. In this way, the advantages of online and in-store shopping can be combined, creating novel multi-channel opportunities for businesses. An empirical evaluation showed that the comparison and recommendation functions were appreciated by users, and hinted some possible benefits of a hybrid physical-online shopping support system. Despite the limitations of the study, there is sufficient evidence to consider this a viable approach worth to be further explored.</p>

    <h3>Balancing relevance and discovery to inspire customers in the IKEA App (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Balazs Toth</p>
    <p>IKEA stores are designed to engage and inspire customers as they make their way from the entrance to check-out. To enable a great experience for every individual, our home-furnishing experts strive to provide the best possible input and advice, catering to individual needs and helping customers realise their vision for life at home.<br>As we move rapidly towards a multi touch point shopping vision with digital at heart, data and machine learning are crucial to 1) enable a consistent journey across, and 2) extend the domain expertise found in stores to our purely digital touch points, like the new IKEA App. A specific example of a digital product where we aim to inspire is our newly launched Inspirational Feed. In the Feed, customers browse their way through ”shoppable” images, in which our products are displayed in purposefully atmospheric settings for a wide range of room types. In this talk, we present our newest algorithmic approach to personalise the Feed based on contextual bandits [2, 3, 4], and highlight some of the technical challenges regarding implementation at scale.<br>The past decade has led to an explosion in research on recommender systems, often with personalised content as a motivating factor [1]. To identify a suitable class of algorithmic strategies for the Feed, note that: To capture the described trade-off between relevance and discovery, as well as matching data for how customers on average shop with IKEA, contextual bandits with batch learning from logged bandit feedback inspired by [4] have shown especially promising results among numerous other exploitation-exploration strategies. This approach induces a fair amount of exploration and minimizes the risk of showing irrelevant images to the customer based on the principle of counterfactual risk minimisation. In our contextual bandit setup, a bandit session is defined as a user session of the Feed taking place in the App (the home of the Feed). An action is displaying an image, while a reward is generated whenever the user clicks on it. The bandit context consists of previous user behaviour collected from the App, combined with product metadata. Our model takes advantage of embeddings of the input features, similar to [1].<br>The implementation of the strategy requires us to handle several interesting edge cases, e.g. we are looking into various techniques for increasing exploration as new images are added to our dynamic content catalogue.</p>

    <h3>From the Lab to Production: A Case Study of Session-Based Recommendations in the Home-Improvement Domain (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pigi Kouki, Xiquan Cui, Khalifeh Al Jadda, Ilias Fountalis, Edo Liberty, Nikolaos Vasiloglou</p>
    <p>E-commerce applications rely heavily on session-based recommendation algorithms to improve the shopping experience of their customers. Recent progress in session-based recommendation algorithms shows great promise. However, translating that promise to real-world outcomes is a challenging task for several reasons, but mostly due to the large number and varying characteristics of the available models. In this paper, we discuss the approach and lessons learned from the process of identifying and deploying a successful session-based recommendation algorithm for a leading e-commerce application in the home-improvement domain. To this end, we initially evaluate fourteen session-based recommendation algorithms in an offline setting using eight different popular evaluation metrics on three datasets. The results indicate that offline evaluation does not provide enough insight to make an informed decision since there is no clear winning method on all metrics. Additionally, we observe that standard offline evaluation metrics fall short for this application. Specifically, they reward an algorithm only when it predicts the exact same item that the user clicked next or eventually purchased. In a practical scenario, however, there are near-identical products which, although they are assigned different identifiers, they should be considered as equally-good recommendations. To overcome these limitations, we perform an additional round of evaluation, where human experts provide both objective and subjective feedback for the recommendations of five algorithms that performed the best in the offline evaluation. We find that the experts’ opinion is oftentimes different from the offline evaluation results. Analysis of the feedback confirms that the performance of all models is significantly higher when we evaluate near-identical product recommendations as relevant. Finally, we run an A/B test with one of the models that performed the best in the human evaluation phase. The treatment model increased conversion rate by 15.6% and revenue per visit by 18.5% when compared with a leading third-party solution.</p>

    <h3>Ghosting: Contextualized Inline Query Completion in Large Scale Retail Search (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uma Murthy, Lakshmi Ramachandran</p>
    <p>Query auto-completion presents a ranked list of queries as suggestions for a user-entered prefix. Ghosting is the process of auto-completing a search recommendation by highlighting the suggested text inline within the search box. We propose the use of a behavior-based recommendation model along with customer search context to ghost on high-confidence queries. We tested ghosting on a retail production system, on over 140 million search sessions. We found that session-context based ghosting significantly increased the acceptance of offered suggestions by 6.18%, reduced misspellings among searches by 4.42%, and improved net sales by 0.14%.</p>

    <h3>Deep Inventory Time Translation to Improve Recommendations for Real-World Retail (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaime R. Camacaro, Bobby Prévost, Jonathan Laflamme Janssen, Carolina Bessega</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are an important component in the retail industry, but the constantly renewed inventory of many companies makes it di cult to aggregate enough data to fully harness the bene ts of such systems. In this paper, we describe a technique that significantly improves the accuracy of the recommendations, validated on real store transaction history, by performing a time translation that maps out-of-stock items to similar items that are currently in stock using deep features of the products. This reduces greatly the dimension of the item–item interactions matrix while preserving all the dataset entries, which mitigates the sparsity of the dataset, and provides an original solution to the cold-start problem. We also improve the coverage at no accuracy cost by favouring less popular items within a small radius in the feature space while applying the time translation mapping. Finally, by modelling item–item rather that user–item correlations, we are able to update item recommendations for a given user in real-time, without re-training, as the user’s history receives new entries.</p>

    <h3>Surveying User Reactions to Recommendations Based on Inferences Made by Face Detection Technology (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jason Wiese, Jennifer Marlow</p>
    <p>It is increasingly possible to use cameras and sensors to detect and analyze human appearance for the purposes of personalizing user experiences. Such systems are already deployed in some public places to personalize advertisements and recommend items. However, since these technologies are not yet widespread, we do not have a good sense of the perceived benefits and drawbacks of public display systems that use face detection as an input for personalized recommendations. We conducted a user study with a system that inferred a user’s gender and age from a facial detection and analysis algorithm and used this to present recommendations in two scenarios (finding stores to visit in a mall and finding a pair of sunglasses to buy).  This work provides an initial step towards understanding user reactions to a new and emerging form of implicit recommendation based on physical appearance.</p>

    <h3>CheckInShop.eu: A Sensor-based Recommender System for micro-location Marketing (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stergios Chairistanidis, Panagiotis Symeonidis</p>
    <p>CheckInShop is an app that employs sensors to capture the user preferences  in physical stores and provide either micro-location marketing or product recommendations. By utilizing iBeacon technology and with the exploitation of a mobile app, we keep track of customer’s preferences in physical stores. Then, based on the time that a product is viewed by a customer and his micro-location inside the store, we send to him either product offers or recommendations of similar products to the ones he is looking at. These recommendations are accurate because they are provided at the right time and in the right place.</p>

    <h3>Getting the Timing Right: Leveraging Category Inter-purchase Times to Improve Recommender Systems (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Vuckovac, Alexander Ilic, Julia Wamsler, Martin Natter</p>
    <p>In the marketing domain, models of grocery buying behavior consider purchase incidence as a key dimension. However, in recommender systems, timing is often subsumed under contextual information and has received little attention yet. For this reason, we analyze the relation between the timing of a recommendation and its acceptance across different product categories. Our study is based on a real-world deployment of an in-store recommendation system in the brick-and-mortar grocery industry. We base our analysis on transaction data of more than 100,000 unique users and more than four million product recommendations. Our findings suggest that the success of a recommendation significantly depends on the inter-purchase time within the respective category. Different sensitivities across product categories further stress the importance of timing and its interplay with category characteristics within the context of recommender systems. The insights gained in this study enable retailers to improve scheduling recommendations and target promotions more efficiently.</p>

    <h3>Cosibon: An e-Commerce Like Platform Enabling Bricks-and-Mortar Stores to Use Sophisticated Product Recommender Systems (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthias Raffelsieper, Thorben Keller</p>
    <p>Compared to online-retailers, bricks-and-mortar stores have only limited possibilities to understand consumer preferences, their intentions, and their feedback. The first are able to evaluate clickstream data collected on their webpages alongside the actual purchase data to put together a comprehensive view on individual customers. Bricks-and-mortar stores on the other hand have to rely solely on the evaluation of scanner data collected at the point of sale. Thus, akin to the Event Horizon in physics, describing the boundary beyond which events are unobservable, we introduce the term Receipt Horizon to describe the natural boundary beyond which a retailing company is unable to observe the behavior of individual customers. In this demo paper we present our comprehensive approach on how bricks-and-mortar stores can go beyond the Receipt Horizon. We demonstrate how existing customer loyalty programs can be leveraged by an extensive mobile app, transferring proven ecommerce concepts to physical retailers and collecting numerous novel information about consumers.</p>
