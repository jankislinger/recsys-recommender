    <h3>Information-Controllable Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixuan Yang, Zirui Guo, Yanhua Yu, Liang Pang, Tat-Seng Chua, Kangkang Lu, Yuling Wang</p>
    <p>In the evolving landscape of recommender systems, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has become a prominent method for enhancing recommendation performance by alleviating the issue of data sparsity. However, existing GCL-based recommendations often overlook the control of shared information between the contrastive views. In this paper, we initially analyze and experimentally demonstrate these methods often lead to the issue of augmented representation collapse, where the representations between views become excessively similar, diminishing their distinctiveness. To address this issue, we propose the Information-Controllable Graph Contrastive Learning (IGCL) framework, a novel approach that focuses on optimizing the shared information between views to include as much relevant information for the recommendation task as possible while maintaining an appropriate level. In particular, we design the Collaborative Signals Enhanced Augmentation module to infuse the augmented representation with rich, task-relevant collaborative signals. Furthermore, the Information-Controllable Contrastive Learning module is designed to direct control over the magnitude of shared information between the contrastive views to avoid over-similarity. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IGCL, showcasing significant improvements in performance and the capability to alleviate augmented representation collapse.</p>

    <h3>A Multi-modal Modeling Framework for Cold-start Short-video Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Gai, Han Li, Ruina Sun, Jingjian Lin, Xinghua Zhang, Gaode Chen, Qi Zhang, Jiangxia Cao, Yuezihan Jiang</p>
    <p>Short video has witnessed rapid growth in the past few years in multimedia platforms. To ensure the freshness of the videos, platforms receive a large number of user-uploaded videos every day, making collaborative filtering-based recommender methods suffer from the item cold-start problem (e.g., the new-coming videos are difficult to compete with existing videos). Consequently, increasing efforts tackle the cold-start issue from the content perspective, focusing on modeling the multi-modal preferences of users, a fair way to compete with new-coming and existing videos. However, recent studies ignore the existing gap between multi-modal embedding extraction and user interest modeling as well as the discrepant intensities of user preferences for different modalities. In this paper, we propose M3CSR, a multi-modal modeling framework for cold-start short video recommendation. Specifically, we preprocess content-oriented multi-modal features for items and obtain trainable category IDs by performing clustering. In each modality, we combine modality-specific cluster ID embedding and the mapped original modality feature as modality-specific representation of the item to address the gap. Meanwhile, M3CSR measures the user modality-specific intensity based on the correlation between modality-specific interest and behavioral interest and employs pairwise loss to further decouple user multi-modal interests. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model. The framework has been deployed on a billion-user scale short video application and has shown improvements in various commercial metrics within cold-start scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Scale-Invariant Learning-to-Rank (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ye-Sheen Lim, Alessio Petrozziello, Xiaoke Liu, Christian Sommeregger</p>
    <p>At Expedia, learning-to-rank (LTR) models plays a key role on our website in sorting and presenting information more relevant to users, such as search filters, property rooms, amenities, and images. A major challenge in deploying these models is ensuring consistent feature scaling between training and production data, as discrepancies can lead to unreliable rankings when deployed. Normalization techniques like feature standardization and batch normalization could address these issues but are impractical in production due to latency impacts and the difficulty of distributed real-time inference. To address consistent feature scaling issue, we introduce a scale-invariant LTR framework which combines a deep and a wide neural network to mathematically guarantee scale-invariance in the model at both training and prediction time.</p>

    <h3>Ranking Across Different Content Types: The Robust Beauty of Multinomial Blending (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Malte Lichtenberg, Giuseppe Di Benedetto, Matteo Ruffini</p>
    <p>An increasing number of media streaming services have expanded their offerings to include entities of multiple content types. For instance, audio streaming services that started by offering music only, now also offer podcasts, merchandise items, and (music) videos. Ranking items across different content types into a single slate poses a significant challenge for traditional learning-to-rank (LTR) algorithms due to differing feature sets and user engagement patterns for different content types. We explore a simple method, called multinomial blending (MB), which can be used in conjunction with most existing LTR algorithms. We compare MB to a range of baselines not only in terms of ranking quality but also from other industry-relevant perspectives such as interpretability, ease-of-use, and stability in dynamic online-learning environments.</p>

    <h3>Pairwise Intent Graph Embedding Learning for Context-Aware Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhao Wu, Zhong Ming, Xiaolian Zhang, Hao Wang, Qinjuan Yang, Dugang Liu, Weixin Li</p>
    <p>Although knowledge graph have shown their effectiveness in mitigating data sparsity in many recommendation tasks, they remain underutilized in context-aware recommender systems (CARS) with the specific sparsity challenges associated with the contextual features, i.e., feature sparsity and interaction sparsity. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel pairwise intent graph embedding learning (PING) framework to efficiently integrate knowledge graph into CARS. Specifically, our PING contains three modules: 1) a graph construction module is used to obtain a pairwise intent graph (PIG) containing nodes for users, items, entities and enhanced intent, where enhanced intent nodes are generated by applying user intent fusion (UIF) on relational intent and contextual intent, and two sub-intents are derived from the semantic information and contextual information, respectively; 2) a pairwise intent joint graph convolution module is used to obtain the refined embeddings of all the features by executing a customized convolution strategy on PIG, where each enhanced intent node acts as a hub to efficiently propagate information among different features and between all the features and knowledge graph; 3) a recommendation module with the refined embeddings is used to replace the randomly initialized embeddings of downstream recommendation models to improve model performance. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to verify the effectiveness and compatibility of our PING.</p>

    <h3>Learning Dynamic Insurance Recommendations from Users’ Click Sessions (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Borg Bruun</p>
    <p>While personalised recommendations have been most successful in domains like retail due to large volume of users’ feedback on items, it is challenging to implement traditional recommender systems into the insurance domain where such prior information is very small in volume. This work addresses the problem of sparse feedback by studying users’ click sessions as signals for learning insurance recommendations. Our preliminary results show limitations in representing click sessions by manually engineered features. The proposed framework uses an autoencoder approach to automatically learns representation of sessions, then a neural network approach to model dependencies across sessions that can be used to predict recommendations. Thereby, it is further able to capture users’ dynamic needs of insurance products evolving over time.</p>

    <h3>Investigating Multimodal Features for Video Recommendations at Globoplay (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Ferreira</p>
    <p>Globoplay is Globo Group’s digital video streaming platform and offers a very diverse video content catalogue ranging from international to brazilian productions such as movies, series, soap operas, and TV programs produced by Globo Group. One of the challenges with such large and diverse content collection is its distribution to the user base in order to help our subscribers with finding relevant content that meets their expectations and to increase their engagement with the product. In this work, we show the result of a content-based recommendation approach based on multi-modal features such as visual characteristics and audio patterns found in the video content. Using techniques applied to short videos, we model it as a similarity problem based on the content of the video, where, given a video, we establish the top-n videos most similar to it in the collection. For the evaluation, we conducted a study through interviews with a group of users to understand their perception of recommendations based on audiovisual characteristics. For the future, we plan to: explore and define the best approach to combine text, audio and video features for video recommendations; explore audiovisual features with other recommendation approaches such as session based and collaborative filtering; perform AB testing in production; and evaluate the proposal impact in business metrics.</p>

    <h3>Online Learning to Rank for Sequential Music Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Ueda, Nivio Ziviani, Bruno L. Pereira, Gustavo Penha, Rodrygo L. T. Santos</p>
    <p>The prominent success of music streaming services has brought increasingly complex challenges for music recommendation. In particular, in a streaming setting, songs are consumed sequentially within a listening session, which should cater not only for the user’s historical preferences, but also for eventual preference drifts, triggered by a sudden change in the user’s context. In this paper, we propose a novel online learning to rank approach for music recommendation aimed to continuously learn from the user’s listening feedback. In contrast to existing online learning approaches for music recommendation, we leverage implicit feedback as the only signal of the user’s preference. Moreover, to adapt rapidly to preference drifts over millions of songs, we represent each song in a lower dimensional feature space and explore multiple directions in this space as duels of candidate recommendation models. Our thorough evaluation using listening sessions from Last.fm demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach at learning faster and better compared to state-of-the-art online learning approaches.</p>

    <h3>Educational Question Routing in Online Student Communities (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Srba, Jakub Macina, Joseph Jay Williams, Maria Bielikova</p>
    <p>Students’ performance in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is enhanced by high quality discussion forums or recently emerging educational Community Question Answering (CQA) systems. Nevertheless, only a small number of students answer questions asked by their peers. This results in instructor overload, and many unanswered questions. To increase students’ participation, we present an approach for recommendation of new questions to students who are likely to provide answers. Existing approaches to such question routing proposed for non-educational CQA systems tend to rely on a few experts, which is not suitable because we want students to be engaged as it positively influences their learning outcomes. In tackling this novel educational question routing problem, our method (1) goes beyond previous question-answering data as it incorporate additional non-QA data from the course (to improve prediction accuracy and to involve a larger part of community) and (2) applies constraints on users’ workload (to prevent user overloading). We use an ensemble classifier for predicting students’ willingness to answer a question, as well as the students’ expertise for answering. We conducted an online evaluation of the proposed method using an A/B test in our CQA system deployed at an edX MOOC. The proposed method outperformed a baseline method (non-educational question routing enhanced with workload restriction) in recommendation accuracy, involving more community members, and average number of contributions.</p>

    <h3>Optimizing Similar Item Recommendations in a Semi-structured Marketplace to Maximize Conversion (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marie Jacob, Natraj Srinivasan, Stephen Neola, Paul Wang, Ryan Snyder, Yuri M Brovman, Daniel Galron</p>
    <p>This paper tackles the problem of recommendations in eBay’s large semi-structured marketplace. eBay’s variable inventory and lack of structured information about listings makes traditional collaborative filtering algorithms difficult to use. We discuss how to overcome these data limitations to produce high quality recommendations in real time with a combination of a customized scalable architecture as well as a widely applicable machine learned ranking model. A pointwise ranking approach is utilized to reduce the ranking problem to a binary classification problem optimized on past user purchase behavior. We present details of a sampling strategy and feature engineering that have been critical to achieve a lift in both purchase through rate (PTR) and revenue.</p>

    <h3>Next Basket Recommendation with Neural Networks (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiafeng Guo, Shengxian Wan, Pengfei Wang, Yanyan Lan, Xueqi Cheng, Jun Xu</p>
    <p>One crucial task in recommendation is to predict what a user will buy next given her shopping history. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network to complete this task. The model consists of an embedding layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Firstly, the distributed representations of the user and the items bought before are obtained and used to form a feature vector by the embedding layer. Then the hidden layer transforms the feature vector to another space by a non-linear operator. Finally, the softmax operator is adopted to output the probabilities of next items. We can see that the model elegantly involves both the user’s general interest and the sequential dependencies between items for prediction. Experimental results on two real datasets prove the effectiveness of our model.</p>
