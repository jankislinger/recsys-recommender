    <h3>A Dataset for Adapting Recommender Systems to the Fashion Rental Economy (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jivitesh Sharma, Karl Audun Borgersen, Morten Goodwin, Morten Grundetjern</p>
    <p>In response to the escalating ecological challenges that threaten global sustainability, there’s a deep need to investigate alternative methods of commerce, such as rental economies. Like most online commerce, rental or otherwise, a functioning recommender system is crucial for their success. Yet the domain has, until this point, been largely neglected by the recommender system research community. Our dataset, derived from our collaboration with the leading Norwegian fashion rental company [Company name omitted for review process], encompasses 64k transactions, rental histories from 2.2k anonymized users, and 15.8k unique outfits in which each physical item’s attributes and rental history is meticulously tracked. All outfits are listed as individual items or their corresponding item groups, referring to shared designs between the individual items. This approach underlines the novel challenges of rental as compared to more traditional recommender system problems where items are generally interchangeable. Each outfit is accompanied by a set of tags describing some of their attributes. We also provide a total of 50k images displaying across all items along with a set of precomputed zero-shot embeddings. We apply a myriad of common recommender system methods to the dataset to provide a performance baseline. This baseline is performed for the traditional fashion recommender system problem of recommending outfit groups and the novel problem of predicting individual item rental. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset discussing the domain of clothes rental. It is our hope that the publication of this dataset will serve as a catalyst for a new branch of research for specialized fashion rental recommender systems. The dataset is temporarily hosted at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/clothes_rental_dataset-B1E8/ and Google Cloud at https: //console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/clothes-rental-dataset The code for collecting, processing, and evaluating the dataset is hosted at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Vibrent_Dataset_Collection-03DC/</p>

    <h3>Towards Sustainable Recommendations in Urban Tourism (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel Merinov</p>
    <p>In the context of urban tourism promotion, I am exploring how recommender systems (RSs) can personalise information in order to shift tourists behaviour from typically popularity-biased towards more niche and urban-friendly. This problem has a great importance in sustainability online promotion campaigns. Urban destination managers strive to prevent overcrowding at popular points of interest (POIs), by attracting visitors to less popular POIs, while still providing personalised access to information. It is assumed, that this approach will maintain a healthy distribution of tourists in a city; both reducing tourist congestion, and, considering each POI as a local business, maintaining the long-term economic viability in a city. This problem has already received some attention in the literature, targeting major European touristic cities. However, many complex issues still need to be resolved for a comprehensive solution. In this extended abstract, I highlight open research problems, and identify key research questions (RQs) that are crucial for advancing sustainable tourism development leveraging RSs. Although the proposed methods are focused on urban tourism, their application extends to different areas of recommendations because the RQs and the proposed methods and techniques are general.</p>

    <h3>Towards Green Recommender Systems: Investigating the Impact of Data Reduction on Carbon Footprint and Algorithm Performances (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michela Milano, Cataldo Musto, Allegra De Filippo, Giuseppe Spillo, Giovanni Semeraro</p>
    <p>This work investigates the path toward green recommender systems by examining the impact of data reduction on both model performance and carbon footprint. In the pursuit of developing energy-efficient recommender systems, we investigated whether and how reducting training data impacts the performances of several representative recommendation models. In order to obtain a fair comparison, all the models were run based on the implementations available in a popular recommendation library, i.e., RecBole, and used the same experimental settings. Results indicate that: (a) data reduction can be a promising strategy to make recommender systems more sustainable at the cost of a lower accuracy; (b) training recommender systems with less data makes the suggestions more diverse and less biased. Overall, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the development of recommendation models that meet the principles of SDGs, laying the groundwork for the adoption of more sustainable practices in the field.</p>

    <h3>Less is More: Towards Sustainability-Aware Persuasive Explanations in Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seda Polat Erdeniz, Viet-Man Le, Sebastian Lubos, Alexander Felfernig, Merfat El Mansi, Thi Ngoc Trang Tran</p>
    <p>Recommender systems play an important role in supporting the achievement of the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs). In recommender systems, explanations can support different goals, such as increasing a user’s trust in a recommendation, persuading a user to purchase specific items, or increasing the understanding of the reasons behind a recommendation. In this paper, we discuss the concept of “sustainability-aware persuasive explanations” which we regard as a major concept to support the achievement of the mentioned SDGs. Such explanations are orthogonal to most existing explanation approaches since they focus on a “less is more” principle, which per se is not included in existing e-commerce platforms. Based on a user study in three item domains, we analyze the potential impacts of sustainability-aware persuasive explanations. The study results are promising regarding user acceptance and the potential impacts of such explanations.</p>

    <h3>Democratizing Urban Mobility Through an Open-Source, Multi-Criteria Route Recommendation System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Eggerth, Javier Argota Sánchez-Vaquerizo, Sachit Mahajan, Dirk Helbing</p>
    <p>Urban navigation systems traditionally optimize for efficiency, thereby overlooking environmental factors and personal preferences. This paper introduces Routify, a novel multi-criteria recommender system for personalized urban route selection. Routify advances the state-of-the-art in route recommendation through: (1) integration of diverse environmental data (air quality, noise levels, green spaces) with real-time IoT inputs; (2) a dynamic weighting algorithm allowing fine-grained user control over routing parameters; (3) transparent decision-making via an interactive interface displaying edge-level information; and (4) a community-driven feedback mechanism that continuously refines recommendations. We have implemented Routify as an open-source platform, facilitating further research and development. Experimental results from 1000 origin-destination pairs demonstrate significant improvements in user-defined environmental metrics (up to 32.98% increase in green index for walking and 16.91% reduction in noise levels for cycling) compared to traditional routing systems. These improvements come with slight trade-offs in distance, especially in walking mode. Our research contributes a comprehensive framework for multi-criteria route recommendation, balancing individual preferences, environmental factors, and community insights in urban navigation.</p>

    <h3>Recommending Healthy and Sustainable Meals exploiting Food Retrieval and Large Language Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Ciro Di Carlo, Giovanni Semeraro, Giovanni Tempesta, Cataldo Musto, Alessandro Petruzzelli</p>
    <p>Many people are constantly seeking to make healthy food choices, but increasingly, we are also considering the impact our dietary habits have on the environment. This creates a complex challenge: how can we ensure that we are eating nutritious foods that nourish our bodies while also minimizing the environmental footprint of our meals?To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework called Healthy And Sustainable eating (HeASe). Given the rising global concerns about nutrition and environmental sustainability, individuals need effective tools to help them navigate these issues. HeASe leverages the latest advancements in artificial intelligence to empower users with knowledge and self-awareness.The framework works in two steps. First, it uses a food retrieval strategy that takes into account macro-nutrient information to identify alternative meals for a chosen recipe. This ensures that the substitutions maintain a similar nutritional profile. Next, HeASe employs large language models to re-rank these potential replacements while considering factors beyond just nutrition, such as the recipe’s environmental impact and other user-defined preferences. The experimental phase of this research demonstrates the capabilities of LLM in identifying the more sustainable and healthy recipe within a set of candidate options. This highlights the potential of these models to guide users towards food choices that are both nutritious and environmentally responsible.</p>

    <h3>From Clicks to Carbon: The Environmental Toll of Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Said, Tobias Vente, Lukas Wegmeth, Joeran Beel</p>
    <p>As global warming soars, evaluating the environmental impact of research is more critical now than ever before. However, we find that few to no recommender systems research papers document their impact on the environment. Consequently, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the environmental impact of recommender system research papers by reproducing a characteristic recommender systems experimental pipeline. We focus on estimating the carbon footprint of recommender systems research papers, highlighting the evolution of the environmental impact of recommender systems research experiments over time. We evaluated all 79 full papers from the ACM RecSys 2013 and 2023 conferences to analyze representative experimental pipelines for papers utilizing traditional, so-called good old-fashioned AI algorithms and deep learning algorithms, respectively. We reproduced these representative experimental pipelines, measured electricity consumption using a hardware energy meter, and converted the measured energy consumption into CO2 equivalents to estimate the environmental impact. Our results show that a recommender systems research paper utilizing deep learning algorithms emits approximately 42 times more CO2 equivalents than a paper utilizing traditional algorithms. Furthermore, such a paper produces, on average, 3,297 kilograms of CO2 equivalents, which is more than one person produces by flying from New York City to Melbourne or the amount one tree sequesters in 300 years.</p>

    <h3>Towards Sustainability-aware Recommender Systems: Analyzing the Trade-off Between Algorithms Performance and Carbon Footprint (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Semeraro, Giuseppe Spillo, Allegra De Filippo, Cataldo Musto, Michela Milano</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of the trade-off between the performance of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and their sustainability. In particular, we compared 18 popular recommendation algorithms in terms of both standard metrics (i.e., accuracy and diversity of the recommendations) as well as in terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint on three different datasets. In order to obtain a fair comparison, all the algorithms were run based on the implementations available in a popular recommendation library, i.e., RecBole, and used the same experimental settings. The outcomes of the experiments clearly showed that the choice of the optimal recommendation algorithm requires a thorough analysis, since more sophisticated algorithms often led to tiny improvements at the cost of an exponential increase of carbon emissions. Through this paper, we aim to shed light on the problem of carbon footprint and energy consumption of recommender systems, and we make the first step towards the development of sustainability-aware recommendation algorithms.</p>

    <h3>Reducing Energy Waste in Households Through Real-Time Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iraklis Varlamis, Akshay Anil Pagar, Janhavi Dahihande, Ajinkya Thakare, Magdalini Eirinaki, Akshay Anil Jaiswal</p>
    <p>The energy consumption of households has steadily increased over the last couple of decades. Research suggests that user behavior is the most influential factor in the energy waste of a household. Thus, there’s a need for helping consumers change their behavior to make it more energy efficient and environment friendly. In this work we propose a real-time recommender system that assists consumers in improving their household’s energy usage. By monitoring the power demand of each appliance in the household, the system detects the device status (on/off) at any moment, and using pattern mining creates a household profile comprising energy consumption patterns for different periods of the day. An intuitive UI allows users to set energy consumption goals and preferences on the appliances they’d like to save energy from. Based on the household profile, the user’s preferences and the actual power demand the system generates personalized real-time recommendations on which appliances should be turned off at a moment. We employ the UK-DALE (UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity) dataset to model and evaluate the entire process, from data preprocessing and transformation of the appliance power demand input to various pattern mining algorithms used to generate appliance usage profiles and recommendations, showing that even small changes in appliance usage behavior can lead to energy savings between 2-17%.</p>

    <h3>Towards Safety and Sustainability: Designing Local Recommendations for Post-pandemic World (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niloy Ganguly, Gourab K Patro, Ashmi Banerjee, Abhijnan Chakraborty</p>
    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has made it paramount to maintain social distance to limit the viral transmission probability. At the same time, local businesses (e.g., restaurants, cafes, stores, malls) need to operate to ensure their economic sustainability. Considering the wide usage of local recommendation platforms like Google Local and Yelp by customers to choose local businesses, we propose to design local recommendation systems which can help in achieving both safety and sustainability goals. Our investigation of existing local recommendation systems shows that they can lead to overcrowding at some businesses compromising customer safety, and very low footfall at other places threatening their economic sustainability. On the other hand, naive ways of ensuring safety and sustainability can cause significant loss in recommendation utility for the customers. Thus, we formally express the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and solve by innovatively mapping it to a bipartite matching problem with polynomial time solutions. Extensive experiments over multiple real-world datasets reveal the efficacy of our approach along with the three-way control over sustainability, safety, and utility goals.</p>

    <h3>Sustainability at Scale: Bridging the Intention-Behavior Gap with Sustainable Recommendations (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lise Getoor, Ben London, Steven Isley, Sabina Tomkins</p>
    <p>We present an approach for jointly discovering sustainable products and sustainability-minded customers while making recommendations informed by these discoveries. Identifying sustainable products, and the customers who are interested in purchasing them, can improve customer satisfaction while also having a potentially large positive environmental impact. Finding sustainable products and evaluating their claims is a significant barrier facing sustainability-minded customers. Tools that reduce both these burdens are likely to boost the sale of sustainable products. However, it is difficult to determine the sustainability characteristics of these products — there are a variety of certifications and definitions of sustainability, and quality labeling requires input from domain experts. In this paper, we propose a flexible probabilistic framework that uses domain knowledge to identify sustainable products and customers, and uses these labels to predict customer purchases. We evaluate our approach on grocery items from the Amazon catalog. Our proposed approach outperforms established recommender system models in predicting future purchases while jointly inferring sustainability scores for customers and products.</p>

    <h3>Effective User Interface Designs to Increase Energy-efficient Behavior in a Rasch-based Energy Recommender System (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alain Starke, Chris Snijders, Martijn Willemsen</p>
    <p>People often struggle to find appropriate energy-saving measures to take in the household. Although recommender studies show that tailoring a system’s interaction method to the domain knowledge of the user can increase energy savings, they did not actually tailor the conservation advice itself. We present two large user studies in which we support users to make an energy-efficient behavioral change by presenting tailored energy-saving advice. Both systems use a one-dimensional, ordinal Rasch scale, which orders 79 energy-saving measures on their behavioral difficulty and link this to a user’s energy-saving ability for tailored advice. We established that recommending Rasch-based advice can reduce a user’s effort, increase system support and, in turn, increase choice satisfaction and lead to the adoption of more energy-saving measures. Moreover, follow-up surveys four weeks later point out that tailoring advice on its feasibility can lead to behavioral change.</p>
