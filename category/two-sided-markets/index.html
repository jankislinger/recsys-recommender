    <h3>Fair Reciprocal Recommendation in Matching Markets (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoji Tomita, Tomohiko Yokoyama</p>
    <p>Recommender systems play an increasingly crucial role in shaping people’s opportunities, particularly in online dating platforms. It is essential from the user’s perspective to increase the probability of matching with a suitable partner while ensuring an appropriate level of fairness in the matching opportunities. We investigate reciprocal recommendation in two-sided matching markets between agents divided into two sides (e.g., men and women). We assume that a successful match requires mutual interest from both men and women involved, and agents would desire to be positioned favorably in the others’ the recommendation lists. We define each agent’s opportunity to be recommended and introduce its fairness criterion, envy-freeness, from the perspective of the fair division theory. The recommendations that approximately maximize the expected number of matches between men and women, empirically obtained by heuristic algorithms, are likely to result in significant unfairness of opportunity. Therefore, there can be a trade-off between maximizing the expected matches and ensuring fairness of opportunity. We propose a method to find a policy that is close to being envy-free by leveraging the Nash social welfare function. Experiments on synthetic and a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving both relatively high expected matches and fairness for opportunities of both men and women in reciprocal recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Matching Theory-based Recommendation in Online Dating (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riku Togashi, Yoji Tomita, Daisuke Moriwaki</p>
    <p>Online dating platforms provide people with the opportunity to find a partner. Recommender systems in online dating platforms suggest one side of users to the other side of users. This reciprocal recommendation problem arises in online dating [26 , 31 ], job recommendation [2] and peer learning process [27]. Reciprocal recommender systems (RRSs) must take into account two aspects which do not arise in standard recommender systems. One aspect is the mutual interests of users. Even if one user has a strong interest in a particular user, she/he may have no interest in him/her at all. Thus, RRSs should be based on the interests of both sides of users. The other important aspect is capacities of the users; it is impossible for a user to keep up with all the candidates. Popular users are often recommended very frequently. As a result, a few super stars receive a large proportion of likes, overwhelming the time that they can spend for screening. RRSs should be designed to alleviate such problems to increase user satisfaction. The two-sided matching problem is to “match” one side of people and the other side in a situation where each person has a different preference and a matching capacity. This field is called matching theory, and various algorithms have been developed since [ 11 , 29 ]. Matching theory is applied in the analyses of marriage markets [4, 8], school choice [1] and job matching for physicians [28]. In this talk, we discuss the potential interactions between RRSs and matching theory. We also present our ongoing project to deploy a matching theory-based recommender system (MTRS) in a real-world online dating platform. This talk covers other important directions regarding RRSs, including scalability, algorithmic fairness, bandit algorithm, and online experimentation.</p>
