    <h3>AMBAR: A dataset for Assessing Multiple Beyond-Accuracy Recommenders (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Contreras, Ludovico Boratto, Elizabeth Gómez, Maria Salamo</p>
    <p>Nowadays a recommendation model should exploit additional information from both the user and item perspectives, in addition to utilizing user-item interaction data. Datasets are central in offering the required information for evaluating new models or algorithms. Although there are many datasets in the literature with user and item properties, there are several issues not covered yet: (i) it is difficult to perform cross-analysis of properties at user and item level as they are not related in most cases; and (ii) on top of that, in many occasions datasets do not allow analysis at different granularity levels. In this paper, we propose a new dataset in the music domain, named AMBAR, that includes the above-mentioned issues. Besides detailing in depth the structure of the new dataset, we also show its application in contexts (i.e., multi-objective, fair, and calibrated recommendations) where both the effectiveness and the beyond-accuracy perspectives of recommendation are assessed.</p>

    <h3>Track Mix Generation on Music Streaming Services using Transformers (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Bouabça, Walid Bendada, Benjamin Chapus, Thibault Cador, Théo Bontempelli, Mathieu Morlon, Guillaume Salha-Galvan</p>
    <p>This paper introduces Track Mix, a personalized playlist generation system released in 2022 on the music streaming service Deezer. Track Mix automatically generates “mix” playlists inspired by initial music tracks, allowing users to discover music similar to their favorite content. To generate these mixes, we consider a Transformer model trained on millions of track sequences from user playlists. In light of the growing popularity of Transformers in recent years, we analyze the advantages, drawbacks, and technical challenges of using such a model for mix generation on the service, compared to a more traditional collaborative filtering approach. Since its release, Track Mix has been generating playlists for millions of users daily, enhancing their music discovery experience on Deezer.</p>

    <h3>Exploring Longitudinal Effects of Session-based Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xavier Serra, Dietmar Jannach, Andres Ferraro</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendation is a problem setting where the task of a recommender system is to make suitable item suggestions based only on a few observed user interactions in an ongoing session. The lack of long-term preference information about individual users in such settings usually results in a limited level of personalization, where a small set of popular items may be recommended to many users. This repeated exposure of such a subset of the items through the recommendations may in turn lead to a reinforcement effect over time, and to a system which is not able to help users discover new content anymore to the desirable extent.<br>In this work, we investigate such potential longitudinal effects of session-based recommendations in a simulation-based approach. Specifically, we analyze to what extent algorithms of different types may lead to concentration effects over time. Our experiments in the music domain reveal that all investigated algorithms—both neural and heuristic ones—may lead to lower item coverage and to a higher concentration on a subset of the items. Additional simulation experiments however also indicate that relatively simple re-ranking strategies, e.g., by avoiding too many repeated recommendations in the music domain, may help to deal with this problem.</p>

    <h3>Ensuring Fairness in Group Recommendations by Rank-Sensitive Balancing of Relevance (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Derek Bridge, Mesut Kaya, Nava Tintarev</p>
    <p>For group recommendations, one objective is to recommend an ordered set of items, a top-N, to a group such that each individual recommendation is relevant for everyone. A common way to do this is to select items on which the group can agree, using so-called ‘aggregation strategies’. One weakness of these aggregation strategies is that they select items independently of each other. They therefore cannot guarantee properties such as fairness, that apply to the set of recommendations as a whole.<br>In this paper, we give a definition of fairness that ‘balances’ the relevance of the recommended items across the group members in a rank-sensitive way. Informally, an ordered set of recommended items is considered fair to a group if the relevance of the items in the top-N is balanced across the group members for each prefix of the top-N. In other words, the first item in the top-N should, as far as possible, balance the interests of all group members; the first two items taken together must do the same; also the first three; and so on up to N. In this paper, we formalize this notion of rank-sensitive balance and provide a greedy algorithm (GFAR) for finding a top-N set of group recommendations that satisfies our definition.<br>We compare the performance of GFAR to five approaches from the literature on two datasets, one from each of the movie and music domains. We evaluate performance for 42 different configurations (two datasets, seven different group sizes, three different group types) and for ten evaluation metrics. We find that GFAR performs significantly better than all other algorithms around 43% of the time; in only 10% of cases are there algorithms that are significantly better than GFAR. Furthermore, GFAR performs particularly well in the most difficult cases, where groups are large and interests within the group diverge. We attribute GFAR’s success both to its rank-sensitivity and its way of balancing relevance. Current methods do not define fairness in a rank-sensitive way (although some achieve a degree of rank-sensitivity through the use of greedy algorithms) and none define balance in the way that we do.</p>

    <h3>Personality Bias of Music Recommendation Algorithms (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Melchiorre, Eva Zangerle, Markus Schedl</p>
    <p><br>Recommender systems, like other tools that make use of machine learning, are known to create or increase certain biases. Earlier work has already unveiled different performance of recommender systems for different user groups, depending on gender, age, country, and consumption behavior. In this work, we study user bias in terms of another aspect, i.e., users’ personality. We investigate to which extent state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms yield different accuracy scores depending on the users’ personality traits. We focus on the music domain and create a dataset of Twitter users’ music consumption behavior and personality traits, measuring the latter in terms of the OCEAN model. Investigating recall@K and NDCG@K of the recommendation algorithms SLIM, embarrassingly shallow autoencoders for sparse data (EASE), and variational autoencoders for collaborative filtering (Mult-VAE) on this dataset, we find several significant differences in performance between user groups scoring high vs. groups scoring low on several personality traits.<br></p>

    <h3>Explainable Recommendation for Repeat Consumption (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masataka Goto, Kosetsu Tsukuda</p>
    <p>Displaying appropriate explanations for recommended items is of vital importance for improving the persuasiveness and user satisfaction of recommender systems. Although a user often consumes the same item repeatedly in some domains such as music and restaurants, existing studies have focused on generating explanations for recommending novel items. In this paper, we describe the concept of explainable recommendation for repeatedly consumed items. Because of the high proportion of repeat consumption in music listening, we suggest nine kinds of explanations for song recommendations according to three factors: personal, social, and item factors. From the results of an online survey involving 622 participants, we evaluate the usefulness of these explanations.</p>

    <h3>Predictability Limits in Session-based Next Item Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priit Järv</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendations are based on the user’s recent actions, for example, the items they have viewed during the current browsing session or the sightseeing places they have just visited. Closely related is sequence-aware recommendation, where the choice of the next item should follow from the sequence of previous actions. We study seven benchmarks for session-based recommendation, covering retail, music and news domains to investigate how accurately user behavior can be predicted from the session histories. We measure the entropy rate of the data and estimate the limit of predictability to be between 44% and 73% in the included datasets. We establish some algorithm-specific limits on prediction accuracy for Markov chains, association rules and k-nearest neighbors methods. With most of the analyzed methods, the algorithm design limits their performance with sparse training data. The session based k-nearest neighbors are least restricted in comparison and have room for improvement across all of the analyzed datasets.</p>

    <h3>Superhighway: Bypass Data Sparsity in Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ting-Hsiang Wang, Ming-Feng Tsai, Yian Chen, Kwei-Herng Lai, Heng-Yu Chi, Chuan-Ju Wang</p>
    <p>Cross-domain collaborative filtering (CF) aims to alleviate data sparsity in single-domain CF by leveraging knowledge transferred from related domains. Many traditional methods focus on enriching compared neighborhood relations in CF directly to address the sparsity problem. In this paper, we propose superhighway construction, an alternative explicit relation-enrichment procedure, to improve recommendations by enhancing cross-domain connectivity. Specifically, assuming partially overlapped items (users), superhighway bypasses multi-hop inter-domain paths between cross-domain users (items, respectively) with direct paths to enrich the cross-domain connectivity. The experiments conducted on a real-world cross-region music dataset and a cross-platform movie dataset show that the proposed superhighway construction significantly improves recommendation performance in both target and source domains.</p>

    <h3>Predicting Musical Sophistication from Music Listening Behaviors: A Preliminary Study (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark Graus, Bruce Ferwerda</p>
    <p>Psychological models are increasingly being used to explain online behavioral traces. Aside from the commonly used personality traits as a general user model, more domain dependent models are gaining attention. The use of domain dependent psychological models allows for more fine-grained identification of behaviors and provide a deeper understanding behind the occurrence of those behaviors. Understanding behaviors based on psychological models can provide an advantage over data-driven approaches. For example, relying on psychological models allow for ways to personalize when data is scarce. In this preliminary work we look at the relation between users’ musical sophistication and their online music listening behaviors and to what extent we can successfully predict musical sophistication. An analysis of data from a study with 61 participants shows that listening behaviors can successfully be used to infer users’ musical sophistication.</p>

    <h3>Accuracy and Diversity in Cross-domain Recommendations for Cold-start Users with Positive-only Feedback (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tommaso Di Noia, Eugenio Di Sciascio, Paolo Tomeo, Ignacio Fernández-Tobías, Iván Cantador</p>
    <p>Computing useful recommendations for cold-start users is a major challenge in the design of recommender systems, and additional data is often required to compensate the scarcity of user feedback. In this paper we address such problem in a target domain by exploiting user preferences from a related auxiliary domain. Following a rigorous methodology for cold-start, we evaluate a number of recommendation methods on a dataset with positive-only feedback in the movie and music domains, both in single and cross-domain scenarios. Comparing the methods in terms of item ranking accuracy, diversity and catalog coverage, we show that cross-domain preference data is useful to provide more accurate suggestions when user feedback in the target domain is scarce or not available at all, and may lead to more diverse recommendations depending on the target domain. Moreover, evaluating the impact of the user profile size and diversity in the source domain, we show that, in general, the quality of target recommendations increases with the size of the profile, but may deteriorate with too diverse profiles.</p>
