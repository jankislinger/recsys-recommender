    <h3>TransNets: Learning to Transform for Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rose Catherine, William Cohen</p>
    <p>Recently, deep learning methods have been shown to improve the performance of recommender systems over traditional methods, especially when review text is available.  For example, a recent model, DeepCoNN, uses neural nets to learn one latent representation for the text of all reviews written by a target user, and a second latent representation for the text of all reviews for a target item, and then combines these latent representations to obtain state-of-the-art performance on recommendation tasks.  We show that (unsurprisingly) much of the predictive value of review text comes from reviews of the target user for the target item. We then introduce a way in which this information can be used in recommendation, even when the target user’s review for the target item is not available.  Our model, called TransNets, extends the DeepCoNN model by introducing an additional latent layer representing the target user-target item pair.  We then regularize this layer, at training time, to be similar to another latent representation of the target user’s review of the target item.  We show that TransNets and extensions of it improve substantially over the previous state-of-the-art.</p>

    <h3>Attacking Item-Based Recommender Systems with Power Items (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Wilson, Carlos Seminario</p>
    <p>Recommender Systems (RS) are vulnerable to attack by malicious users who intend to bias the recommendations for their own benefit. Research in this area has developed attack models, detection methods, and mitigation schemes to understand and protect against such attacks. For Collaborative Filtering RSs, model-based approaches such as item-based and matrix-factorization were found to be more robust to many types of attack. Advice in designing for system robustness has thus been to employ model-based approaches. Our recent work with the Power User Attack (PUA), however, determined that attackers disguised as influential users can successfully attack (from the attacker’s viewpoint) SVD-based recommenders, as well as user-based. Though item-based systems remained robust to the PUA. In this paper we investigate a new, complementary attack model, the Power Item Attack (PIA), that uses influential items to successfully attack RSs. We show that the PIA is able to impact not only user-based and SVD-based recommenders but also the heretofore highly robust item-based approach, using a novel multi-target attack vector.</p>
