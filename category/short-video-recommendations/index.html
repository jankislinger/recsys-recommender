    <h3>Not All Videos Become Outdated: Short-Video Recommendation by Learning to Deconfound Release Interval Bias (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aixin Sun, Guoxiu He, Lulu Dong</p>
    <p>Short-video recommender systems often exhibit a biased preference to recently released videos. However, not all videos become outdated; certain classic videos can still attract user’s attention. Such bias along temporal dimension can be further aggravated by the matching model between users and videos, because the model learns from preexisting interactions. From real data, we observe that different videos have varying sensitivities to recency in attracting users’ attention. Our analysis, based on a causal graph modeling short-video recommendation, suggests that the release interval serves as a confounder, establishing a backdoor path between users and videos. To address this confounding effect, we propose a model-agnostic causal architecture called Learning to Deconfound the Release Interval Bias (LDRI). LDRI enables jointly learning of the matching model and the video recency sensitivity perceptron. In the inference stage, we apply a backdoor adjustment, effectively blocking the backdoor path by intervening on each video. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that LDRI consistently outperforms backbone models and exhibits superior performance against state-of-the-art models. Additional comprehensive analyses confirm the deconfounding capability of LDRI. Our code is available online: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LDRI/.</p>

    <h3>A Probabilistic Position Bias Model for Short-Video Recommendation Feeds (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Jeunen</p>
    <p>Modern web-based platforms often show ranked lists of recommendations to users, in an attempt to maximise user satisfaction or business metrics. Typically, the goal of such systems boils down to maximising the exposure probability — conversely, minimising the rank— for items that are deemed “reward-maximising” according to some metric of interest. This general framing comprises music or movie streaming applications, as well as e-commerce, restaurant or job recommendations, and even web search. Position bias or user models can be used to estimate exposure probabilities for each use-case, specifically tailored to how users interact with the presented rankings. A unifying factor in these diverse problem settings is that typically only one or several items will be engaged with (clicked, streamed, purchased, et cetera) before a user leaves the ranked list.  Short-video feeds on social media platforms diverge from this general framing in several ways, most notably that users do not tend to leave the feed after, for example, liking a post. Indeed, seemingly infinite feeds invite users to scroll further down the ranked list. For this reason, existing position bias or user models tend to fall short in such settings, as they do not accurately capture users’ interaction modalities. In this work, we propose a novel and probabilistically sound personalised position bias model for feed recommendations. We focus on a 1st-level feed in a hierarchical structure, where users may enter a 2nd-level feed via any given 1st-level item. We posit that users come to the platform with a given scrolling budget that is drawn according to a discrete power-law distribution, and show how the survival function of said distribution can be used to obtain closed-form estimates for personalised exposure probabilities. Empirical insights gained through data from a large-scale social media platform show how our probabilistic position bias model more accurately captures empirical exposure than existing models, and paves the way for improved unbiased evaluation and learning-to-rank.</p>

    <h3>Leveraging Post-click Feedback for Content Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongyi Wen, Longqi Yang, Deborah Estrin</p>
    <p>Implicit feedback (e.g., clicks) is widely used in content recommendations. However, clicks only reflect user preferences according to their first impressions. They do not capture the extent to which users continue to engage with the content. Our analysis shows that more than half of the clicks on music and short videos are followed by skips from two real-world datasets. In this paper, we leverage post-click feedback, e.g. skips and completions, to improve the training and evaluation of content recommenders. Specifically, we experiment with existing collaborative filtering algorithms and find that they perform poorly against post-click-aware ranking metrics. Based on these insights, we develop a generic probabilistic framework to fuse click and post-click signals. We show how our framework can be applied to improve pointwise and pairwise recommendation models. Our approach is shown to outperform existing methods by 18.3% and 2.5% respectively in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) on the short-video and music dataset. We discuss the effectiveness of our approach across content domains and trade-offs in weighting various user feedback signals.</p>
