    <h3>Auto-Surprise: An Automated Recommender-System (AutoRecSys) Library with Tree of Parzens Estimator (TPE) Optimization (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohan Anand, Joeran Beel</p>
    <p>We introduce Auto-Surprise1, an automated recommender system library. Auto-Surprise is an extension of the Surprise recommender system library and eases the algorithm selection and configuration process. Compared to an out-of-the-box Surprise library, without hyper parameter optimization, AutoSurprise performs better, when evaluated with MovieLens, Book Crossing and Jester datasets. It may also result in the selection of an algorithm with significantly lower runtime. Compared to Surpriseâ€™s grid search, Auto-Surprise performs equally well or slightly better in terms of RMSE, and is notably faster in finding the optimum hyperparameters.</p>

    <h3>Kernelized Probabilistic Matrix Factorization for Collaborative Filtering: Exploiting Projected User and Item Graph (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bithika Pal, Mamata Jenamani</p>
    <p>Matrix Factorization (MF) techniques have already shown its strong foundation in collaborative filtering (CF), particularly for rating prediction problem. MF models mainly work as low-rank matrix completion problem by mapping the users and items into same low dimensional latent space. In this direction, now-a-days, a majority of the studies have focused on using additional information such as social network, item tags along with rating to mitigate different issues in the basic recommendation. This results in making the model more complex with a very specific target. However, there are very few studies in recent years which use only users rating information for the recommendation. In this paper, we present a new finding on exploiting Projected User and Item Graph in the setting of Kernelized Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (KPMF), which uses different graph kernel from the projected graphs. KPMF, here, works with its latent vector spanning over all users (and items) with Gaussian process priors and tries to capture the covariance structure across users and items from the projected graphs. We also explore the ways of building these projected graphs maintaining some properties to maximize the prediction accuracy. We implement the model in four real-world datasets and compare the results with state-of-the-art MF techniques. Using projected graph in KPMF, we achieve significant improvement in RMSE using only rating information of users.</p>

    <h3>pyRecLab: A Software Library for Quick Prototyping of Recommender Systems (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Parra, Gabriel Sepulveda</p>
    <p>This paper introduces pyRecLab, a software library written in C++ with Python bindings which allows to quickly train, test and develop recommender systems. Although there are several software libraries for this purpose, only a few let developers to get quickly started with the most traditional methods, permitting them to try different parameters and approach several tasks without a significant loss of performance. Among the few libraries that have all these features, they are available in languages such as Java, Scala or C#, what is a disadvantage for less experienced programmers more used to the popular Python programming language. In this article we introduce details of pyRecLab, showing as well performance analysis in terms of error metrics (MAE and RMSE) and train/test time. We benchmark it against the popular Java-based library LibRec, showing similar results. We expect programmers with little experience and people interested in quickly prototyping recommender systems to be benefited from pyRecLab.</p>
