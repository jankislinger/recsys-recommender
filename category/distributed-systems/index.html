    <h3>Stalactite: toolbox for fast prototyping of vertical federated learning systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Khodorchenko, Anastasiia Zakharova, Dmitriy Alexandrov, Alexey Vasilev, Maxim Savchenko, Nikolay Butakov, Alexander Grigorievskiy</p>
    <p>Machine learning (ML) models trained on datasets owned by different organizations and physically located in remote databases offer benefits in many real-world use cases. State regulations or business requirements often prevent data transfer to a central location, making it difficult to utilize standard machine learning algorithms. Federated Learning (FL) is a technique that enables models to learn from distributed datasets without revealing the original data. Vertical Federated learning (VFL) is a type of FL where data samples are divided by features across several data owners. For instance, in a recommendation task, a user can interact with various sets of items, and the logs of these interactions are stored by different organizations. In this demo paper, we present Stalactite – an open-source framework for VFL that provides the necessary functionality for building prototypes of VFL systems. It has several advantages over the existing frameworks. In particular, it allows researchers to focus on the algorithmic side rather than engineering and to easily deploy learning in a distributed environment. It implements several VFL algorithms and has a built-in homomorphic encryption layer. We demonstrate its use on a real-world recommendation datasets.</p>

    <h3>A GPU-specialized Inference Parameter Server for Large-Scale Deep Recommendation Models (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingcan Wei, Fan Yu, Jie Liu, Ji Shi, Matthias Langer, Minseok Lee, Zehuan Wang</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems are of crucial importance for a variety of modern apps and web services, such as news feeds, social networks, e-commerce, search, etc. To achieve peak prediction accuracy, modern recommendation models combine deep learning with terabyte-scale embedding tables to obtain a fine-grained representation of the underlying data. Traditional inference serving architectures require deploying the whole model to standalone servers, which is infeasible at such massive scale.<br>In this paper, we provide insights into the intriguing and challenging inference domain of online recommendation systems. We propose the HugeCTR Hierarchical Parameter Server (HPS), an industry-leading distributed recommendation inference framework, that combines a high-performance GPU embedding cache with an hierarchical storage architecture, to realize low-latency retrieval of embeddings for online model inference tasks. Among other things, HPS features (1) a redundant hierarchical storage system, (2) a novel high-bandwidth cache to accelerate parallel embedding lookup on NVIDIA GPUs, (3) online training support and (4) light-weight APIs for easy integration into existing large-scale recommendation workflows. To demonstrate its capabilities, we conduct extensive studies using both synthetically engineered and public datasets. We show that our HPS can dramatically reduce end-to-end inference latency, achieving 5~62x speedup (depending on the batch size) over CPU baseline implementations for popular recommendation models. Through multi-GPU concurrent deployment, the HPS can also greatly increase the inference QPS.</p>

    <h3>Secure Multi-Party Protocols for Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tamir Tassa, Erez Shmueli</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have become extremely common in recent years, and are utilized in a variety of domains such as movies, music, news, products, restaurants, etc. While a typical recommender system bases its recommendations solely on users’ preference data collected by the system itself, the quality of recommendations can significantly be improved if several recommender systems (or vendors) share their data. However, such data sharing poses significant privacy and security challenges, both to the vendors and the users. In this paper we propose secure protocols for distributed item-based Collaborative Filtering. Our protocols allow to compute both the predicted ratings of items and their predicted rankings, without compromising privacy nor predictions’ accuracy. Unlike previous solutions in which the secure protocols are executed solely by the vendors, our protocols assume the existence of a mediator that performs intermediate computations on encrypted data supplied by the vendors. Such a mediated setting is advantageous over the non-mediated one since it enables each vendor to communicate solely with the mediator. This yields reduced communication costs and it allows each vendor to issue recommendations to its clients without being dependent on the availability and willingness of the other vendors to collaborate.</p>

    <h3>Asynchronous Distributed Matrix Factorization with Similar User and Item Based Regularization (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Franck Iutzeler, Bikash Joshi, Massih-Reza Amini</p>
    <p>We introduce an asynchronous distributed stochastic gradient algorithm for matrix factorization based collaborative filtering. The main idea of this approach is to distribute the user-rating matrix across different machines, each having access only to a part of the information, and to asynchronously propagate the updates of the stochastic gradient optimization across the network. Each time a machine receives a parameter vector, it averages its current parameter vector with the received one, and continues its iterations from this new point. Additionally, we introduce a similarity based regularization that constrains the user and item factors to be close to the average factors of their similar users and items found on subparts of the distributed user-rating matrix. We analyze the impact of the regularization terms on MovieLens (100K, 1M, 10M) and NetFlix datasets and show that it leads to a more efficient matrix factorization in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and that the asynchronous distributed approach significantly improves in convergence time as compared to an equivalent synchronous distributed approach.</p>

    <h3>Voting Operations for a Group Recommender System in a Distributed User Interface Environment. (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Part Saelim, Wolfgang Wörndl</p>
    <p>This work investigates distributed user interfaces for group recommender systems. In our scenario of a movie recommender, the user interface is distributed on two platforms: personal mobile devices and a public multi-touch tabletop. Our solution proposes voting operations to better support the consensus building among group members. We have implemented a prototype and conducted a preliminary user study with interesting results.</p>
