    <h3>Recommending Personalised Targeted Training Adjustments for Marathon Runners (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ciara Feely, Aonghus Lawlor, Barry Smyth, Brian Caulfield</p>
    <p>Preparing for the marathon involves many weeks of dedicated training. Achieving the right balance between building strength and endurance and the need for rest and recovery is a must, if a runner is to arrive at the start-line injury-free and ready to achieve their desired finish-time. However, because most recreational runners rely on generic training plans, they can struggle to find this balance, which can impact their motivation, health, and performance. In this paper, we describe a novel case-based reasoning approach to fine-tuning a runnerâ€™s training by recommending training adjustments based on the patterns of similar runners at corresponding points in their marathon training. The approach is designed to target training adjustments that are based on similar runners but with varying race goals,  to allow runners to adjust their training for slower or faster finish-times, as their training progresses and motivations change. We evaluate the recommendations produced using a large-scale real-world dataset according to several factors including, (i) the plausibility of the recommended training adjustment, (ii) the effectiveness of the adjustment when it comes to achieving a particular performance goal, and (iii) the safety of the adjustment in terms of the degree of risk that it will lead to an injury or otherwise disrupt training. Our findings suggest that plausible, effective, and safe recommendations can be generated for runners when evaluated against a range of race goals.</p>

    <h3>Providing Explainable Race-Time Predictions and Training Plan Recommendations to Marathon Runners (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barry Smyth, Aonghus Lawlor, Brian Caulfield, Ciara Feely</p>
    <p>Millions of people participate in marathon events every year, typically devoting at least 12-16 weeks to building their endurance and fitness so that they can safely complete these gruelling 42.2km races. Most runners follow a training plan that is tailored to their expected finish-time (e.g. sub-4 hours or 4-5 hours), and these plans will prescribe a complex mixture of training sessions to help them achieve these times. However, such plans cannot adapt to the individual needs (fitness levels, changing goals, personal preferences) of runners, providing only broad training guidance rather than more personalised support. The development of wearable sensors and mobile fitness applications facilitates the collection of a large amount of training data from runners. In this paper, we propose a recommender system that utilizes such training data to deliver more personalised training advice to runners, using ideas from case-based reasoning to reuse and adapt the training habits of similar runners. Explainability plays a significant role in this type of system, and we also describe how the predictions and recommendation advice can be presented to runners. An initial off-line evaluation is presented based on a large-scale, real-world dataset.</p>

    <h3>Financial Product Recommendation through Case-based Reasoning and Diversification Techniques (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cataldo Musto, Georgios Lekkas, Pasquale Lops, Marco De Gemmis, Giovanni Semeraro</p>
    <p>This work proposes a framework for financial product recommendation which combines case-based reasoning with diversification techniques to support wealth managers in recommending personalized investment portfolios. The performance of the framework has been evaluated against 1172 real users, and results show that the yield obtained by recommended portfolios overcomes that of portfolios proposed by human advisors in many experimental settings.</p>
