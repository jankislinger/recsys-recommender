    <h3>RecSysOps: Best Practices for Operating a Large-Scale Recommender System (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Saberian</p>
    <p>Ensuring the health of a modern large-scale recommendation system is a very challenging problem. To address this, we need to put in place proper logging, sophisticated exploration policies, develop ML-interpretability tools or even train new ML models to predict/detect issues of the main production model. In this talk, we shine a light on this less-discussed but important area and share some of the best practices, called RecSysOps, that weâ€™ve learned while operating our increasingly complex recommender systems at Netflix. RecSysOps is a set of best practices for identifying issues and gaps as well as diagnosing and resolving them in a large-scale machine-learned recommender system. RecSysOps helped us to 1) reduce production issues and 2) increase recommendation quality by identifying areas of improvement and 3) make it possible to bring new innovations faster to our members by enabling us to spend more of our time on new innovations and less on debugging and firefighting issues.</p>

    <h3>pyRecLab: A Software Library for Quick Prototyping of Recommender Systems (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Parra, Gabriel Sepulveda</p>
    <p>This paper introduces pyRecLab, a software library written in C++ with Python bindings which allows to quickly train, test and develop recommender systems. Although there are several software libraries for this purpose, only a few let developers to get quickly started with the most traditional methods, permitting them to try different parameters and approach several tasks without a significant loss of performance. Among the few libraries that have all these features, they are available in languages such as Java, Scala or C#, what is a disadvantage for less experienced programmers more used to the popular Python programming language. In this article we introduce details of pyRecLab, showing as well performance analysis in terms of error metrics (MAE and RMSE) and train/test time. We benchmark it against the popular Java-based library LibRec, showing similar results. We expect programmers with little experience and people interested in quickly prototyping recommender systems to be benefited from pyRecLab.</p>
