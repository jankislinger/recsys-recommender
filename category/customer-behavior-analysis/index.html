    <h3>Recommending Product Sizes to Customers (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Varadarajan Sembium, Atul Saroop, Srujana Merugu, Rajeev Rastogi</p>
    <p>We propose a novel latent factor model for recommending product size fits {Small, Fit, Large} to customers. Latent factors for customers and products in our model correspond to their physical true size, and are learnt from past product purchase and returns data. The outcome for a customer, product pair is predicted based on the difference between customer and product true sizes, and efficient algorithms are proposed for computing customer and product true size values that minimize two loss function variants. In experiments with Amazon shoe datasets, we show that our latent factor models incorporating personas, and leveraging return codes show a 17-21% AUC improvement compared to baselines. In an online A/B test, recommendations produced by our algorithms show an improvement of 33 basis points in percentage of Fit transactions over control.</p>

    <h3>Data-Driven Repricing Strategies in Competitive Markets: An Interactive Simulation Platform (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolai Jannik Podlesny, Martin Boissier, Jan Selke, Rainer Schlosser, Matthias Uflacker, Johanna Latt, Sebastian Serth, Marvin Bornstein, Jan Lindemann</p>
    <p>Modern e-commerce platforms pose both opportunities as well as hurdles for merchants. While merchants can observe markets at any point in time and automatically reprice their products, they also have to compete simultaneously with dozens of competitors. Currently, retailers lack the possibility to test, develop, and evaluate their algorithms appropriately before releasing them into the real world. At the same time, it is challenging for researchers to investigate how pricing strategies interact with each other under heavy competition. To study dynamic pricing competition on online marketplaces, we built an open simulation platform. To be both flexible and scalable, the platform has a microservice-based architecture and handles large numbers of competing merchants and arriving consumers. It allows merchants to deploy the full width of pricing strategies, from simple rule-based strategies to more sophisticated data-driven strategies using machine learning. Our platform enables analyses of how a strategy’s performance is affected by customer behavior, price adjustment frequencies, the competitors’ strategies, and the exit/entry of competitors. Moreover, our platform allows to study the long-term behavior of self-adapting strategies.</p>
