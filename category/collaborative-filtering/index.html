    <h3>MARec: Metadata Alignment for cold-start Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anirban Majumder, Wentao Lu, Julien Monteil, Volodymyr Vaskovych, Anton van den Hengel</p>
    <p>For many recommender systems the primary data source is a historical record of user clicks. The associated click matrix which is often very sparse, however, as the number of users x products can be far larger than the number of clicks, and such sparsity is accentuated in cold-start settings. The sparsity of the click matrix is the reason matrix factorization and autoencoders techniques remain highly competitive across collaborative filtering datasets. In this work, we propose a simple approach to address cold-start recommendations by leveraging content metadata, Metadata Alignment for cold-start Recommendation (MARec). we show that this approach can readily augment existing matrix factorization and autoencoder approaches, enabling a smooth transition to top performing algorithms in warmer set-ups. Our experimental results indicate three separate contributions: first, we show that our proposed framework largely beats SOTA results on 4 cold-start datasets with different sparsity and scale characteristics, with gains ranging from +8.4% to +53.8% on reported ranking metrics; second, we provide an ablation study on the utility of semantic features, and proves the additional gain obtained by leveraging such features ranges between +46.8% and +105.5%; and third, our approach is by construction highly competitive in warm set-ups, and we propose a closed-form solution outperformed by SOTA results by only 0.8% on average.</p>

    <h3>Explore versus repeat: insights from an online supermarket (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariagiorgia Agnese Tandoi, Daniela Solis Morales</p>
    <p>At online supermarket Picnic, we implemented both traditional collaborative filtering and a hybrid method to provide recipe recommendations at scale. This case study presents findings from the online evaluation of these algorithms, focusing on the repeat-explore trade-off. Our findings allow other online retailers to gain insights into the importance of thoughtful model design in navigating this important balance. We argue that even when exploiting known preferences proves highly beneficial in the short term, prioritizing exploratory content is essential for long-term customer satisfaction and sustained growth. Our research lays the groundwork for a compelling discussion on defining success in balancing the familiar and the novel in online grocery shopping.</p>

    <h3>Why the Shooting in the Dark Method Dominates Recommender Systems Practice (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Rohde</p>
    <p>The introduction of A/B Testing represented a great leap forward in recommender systems research. Like the randomized control trial for evaluating drug efficacy; A/B Testing has equipped recommender systems practitioners with a protocol for measuring performance as defined by actual business metrics and with minimal assumptions. While A/B testing provided a way to measure the performance of two or more candidate systems, it provides no guide for determining what policy we should test. The focus of this industry talk is to better understand, why the development of A/B testing was the last great leap forward in the development of reward optimizing recommender systems despite more than a decade of efforts in both industry and academia. The talk will survey: industry best practice, standard theories and tools including: collaborative filtering (MovieLens RecSys), contextual bandits, attribution, off-policy estimation, causal inference, click through rate models and will explain why we have converged on a fundamentally heuristic solution or guess and check type method. The talk will offer opinions about which of these theories are useful, and which are not and make a concrete proposal to make progress based on a non-standard use of deep learning tools.</p>

    <h3>SeCor: Aligning Semantic and Collaborative representations by Large Language Models for Next-Point-of-Interest Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling Ding, Yang Xiang, Jianting Chen, Shirui Wang, Xiaoying Gao, Bohan Xie</p>
    <p>The widespread adoption of location-based applications has created a growing demand for point-of-interest (POI) recommendation, which aims to predict a user’s next POI based on their historical check-in data and current location. However, existing methods often struggle to capture the intricate relationships within check-in data. This is largely due to their limitations in representing temporal and spatial information and underutilizing rich semantic features. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful semantic comprehension to solve them, they are limited by hallucination and the inability to incorporate global collaborative information. To address these issues, we propose a novel method SeCor, which treats POI recommendation as a multi-modal task and integrates semantic and collaborative representations to form an efficient hybrid encoding. SeCor first employs a basic collaborative filtering model to mine interaction features. These embeddings, as one modal information, are fed into LLM to align with semantic representation, leading to efficient hybrid embeddings. To mitigate the hallucination, SeCor recommends based on the hybrid embeddings rather than directly using the LLM’s output text. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that SeCor outperforms all baselines, achieving improved recommendation performance by effectively integrating collaborative and semantic information through LLMs.</p>

    <h3>Unlocking the Hidden Treasures: Enhancing Recommendations with Unlabeled Data (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Chen, Li Chen, Hongtao Song, Yuhan Zhao, Qilong Han</p>
    <p>Collaborative filtering (CF) stands as a cornerstone in recommender systems, yet effectively leveraging the vast reservoir of unlabeled data presents a persistent challenge. Current research endeavors to address the challenge of unlabeled data by extracting a subset closely approximating negative samples. Regrettably, the remaining data are overlooked, failing to fully integrate this valuable information into the construction of user preferences. To address this gap, we introduce a novel positive-neutral-negative (PNN) learning paradigm. PNN introduces a neutral class, encompassing intricate items challenging to categorize directly as positive or negative samples. By training a model based on this triple-wise partial ranking, PNN offers a promising solution to learning complex user preferences. Through theoretical analysis, we connect PNN to one-way partial AUC (OPAUC) to validate its efficacy. Implementing the PNN paradigm is, however, technically challenging because: (1) it is difficult to classify unobserved items into neutral or negative in the absence of supervisory signals; (2) there does not exist any loss function that can handle set-level triple-wise ranking relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a semi-supervised learning method coupled with a user-aware attention model for knowledge acquisition and classification refinement. Additionally, a novel loss function and two-step centroid ranking approach enable handling set-level rankings. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that, when combined with PNN, a wide range of representative CF models can consistently and significantly boost their performance. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PNN-RecBole-4E04.</p>

    <h3>Distillation Matters: Empowering Sequential  Recommenders to Match the Performance of Large Language Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiawei Chen, Yi Wan, Heng Tang, Bohao Wang, Feng Liu, Pengbo Wang, Jun Wang, Yu Cui</p>
    <p>Owing to their powerful semantic reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been effectively utilized as recommenders, achieving impressive performance. However, the high inference latency of LLMs significantly restricts their practical deployment. To address this issue, this work investigates knowledge distillation from cumbersome LLM-based recommendation models to lightweight conventional sequential models. It encounters three challenges: 1) the teacher’s knowledge may not always be reliable; 2) the capacity gap between the teacher and student makes it difficult for the student to assimilate the teacher’s knowledge; 3) divergence in semantic space poses a challenge to distill the knowledge from embeddings. To tackle these challenges, this work proposes a novel distillation strategy, DLLM2Rec, specifically tailored for knowledge distillation from LLM-based recommendation models to conventional sequential models. DLLM2Rec comprises: 1) Importance-aware ranking distillation, which filters reliable and student-friendly knowledge by weighting instances according to teacher confidence and student-teacher consistency; 2)  Collaborative embedding distillation integrates knowledge from teacher embeddings with collaborative signals mined from the data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DLLM2Rec, boosting three typical sequential models with an average improvement of 47.97%, even enabling them to surpass LLM-based recommenders in some cases.</p>

    <h3>Information-Controllable Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixuan Yang, Zirui Guo, Yanhua Yu, Liang Pang, Tat-Seng Chua, Kangkang Lu, Yuling Wang</p>
    <p>In the evolving landscape of recommender systems, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has become a prominent method for enhancing recommendation performance by alleviating the issue of data sparsity. However, existing GCL-based recommendations often overlook the control of shared information between the contrastive views. In this paper, we initially analyze and experimentally demonstrate these methods often lead to the issue of augmented representation collapse, where the representations between views become excessively similar, diminishing their distinctiveness. To address this issue, we propose the Information-Controllable Graph Contrastive Learning (IGCL) framework, a novel approach that focuses on optimizing the shared information between views to include as much relevant information for the recommendation task as possible while maintaining an appropriate level. In particular, we design the Collaborative Signals Enhanced Augmentation module to infuse the augmented representation with rich, task-relevant collaborative signals. Furthermore, the Information-Controllable Contrastive Learning module is designed to direct control over the magnitude of shared information between the contrastive views to avoid over-similarity. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IGCL, showcasing significant improvements in performance and the capability to alleviate augmented representation collapse.</p>

    <h3>Neighborhood-Based Collaborative Filtering for Conversational Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Mcauley, Zhouhang Xie, Nathan Kallus, Dawen Liang, Rahul Jha, Hyunsik Jeon, Zhankui He, Harald Steck, Junda Wu</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) should understand users’ expressed interests that are frequently semantically rich and knowledge intensive. Prior works attempt to address this challenge by making use of external knowledge bases or parametric knowledge in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we study a complementary solution, exploiting item knowledge in the training data. We hypothesise that many inference-time user requests can be answered via reusing popular crowd-written answers associated with similar training queries. Following this intuition, we define a class of neighborhood-based CRS that make recommendations by identifying popular items associated with similar training dialogue contexts. Experiments on Inspired, Redial, and Reddit benchmarks show that despite its simplicity, our method achieves comparable to better performance than state-of-the-art LLM-based methods with over 200 times more parameters. We also show neighborhood and model-based predictions can be combined to achieve further performance improvements over both components.</p>

    <h3>A Multimodal Single-Branch Embedding Network for Recommendation in Cold-Start and Missing Modality Scenarios (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Hausberger, Markus Schedl, Christian Ganhör, Shah Nawaz, Marta Moscati</p>
    <p>Most recommender systems adopt collaborative filtering (CF) and provide recommendations based on past collective interactions. Therefore, the performance of CF algorithms degrades when few or no interactions are available, a scenario referred to as cold-start. To address this issue, previous work relies on models leveraging both collaborative data and side information on the users or items. Similar to multimodal learning, these models aim at combining collaborative and content representations in a shared embedding space. In this work we propose a novel technique for multimodal recommendation, relying on a multimodal Single-Branch embedding network for Recommendation (SiBraR). Leveraging weight-sharing, SiBraR encodes interaction data as well as multimodal side information using the same single-branch embedding network on different modalities. This makes SiBraR effective in scenarios of missing modality, including cold start. Our extensive experiments on large-scale recommendation datasets from three different recommendation domains (music, movie, and e-commerce) and providing multimodal content information (audio, text, image, labels, and interactions) show that SiBraR significantly outperforms CF as well as state-of-the-art content-based RSs in cold-start scenarios, and is competitive in warm scenarios. We show that SiBraR’s recommendations are accurate in missing modality scenarios, and that the model is able to map different modalities to the same region of the shared embedding space, hence reducing the modality gap.</p>

    <h3>Integrating Matrix Factorization with Graph based Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rachana Mehta</p>
    <p>Graph based Recommender models make use of user-item rating and user-user social relationships to elicit recommendation performance by extracting inherent geometrical knowledge. In a social graph scenario, user-user trust plays a significant role in reducing sparsity and has varied characteristics that can be exploited. Existing models limit themselves to learning from either a high order interaction graph of user-item ratings or a user-user social graph from trust value. They explore other trust characteristics in a very limited setting. The graph based model, designed using entire user-user social information, impacts performance and escalates complexities in model learning. To alleviate these issues of graph learning, graph recommender seeks assistance from matrix factorization techniques. Incorporating graph based model with matrix factorization brings its own set of challenges of model integration, leveraging trust, graph learning, and optimization. This article presents the existing work in that line and future possibilities and challenges to be catered to through novel developments</p>

    <h3>Bridging Search and Recommendation in Generative Retrieval: Does One Task Help the Other? (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco De Nadai, Ali Vardasbi, Enrico Palumbo, Hugues Bouchard, Gustavo Penha</p>
    <p>Generative retrieval for search and recommendation is a promising paradigm for retrieving items, offering an alternative to traditional methods that depend on external indexes and nearest-neighbor searches. Instead, generative models directly associate inputs with item IDs. Given the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), these generative systems play a crucial role in centralizing a variety of Information Retrieval (IR) tasks in a single model that performs tasks such as query understanding, retrieval, recommendation, explanation, re-ranking, and response generation. Despite the growing interest in such a unified generative approach for IR systems, the advantages of using a single, multi-task model over multiple specialized models are not well established in the literature. This paper investigates whether and when such a unified approach can outperform task-specific models in the IR tasks of search and recommendation, broadly co-existing in multiple industrial online platforms, such as Spotify, YouTube, and Netflix. Previous work shows that (1) the latent representations of items, learned by generative recommenders, are biased towards popularity, and (2) content-based and collaborative-filtering-based information can improve an item’s representations. Motivated by this, our study is guided by two hypotheses: [H1] the joint training regularizes the estimation of each item’s popularity, and [H2] the joint training regularizes the item’s latent representations, where search captures content-based aspects of an item and recommendation captures collaborative-filtering aspects. Our extensive experiments with both simulated and real-world data support both [H1] and [H2] as key contributors to the effectiveness improvements observed in the unified search and recommendation generative models over the single-task approaches.</p>

    <h3>Augmented Negative Sampling for Collaborative Filtering (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Chen, Riwei Lai, Hongtao Song, Qilong Han, Rui Chen, Yuhan Zhao</p>
    <p>Negative sampling is essential for implicit-feedback-based collaborative filtering, which is used to constitute negative signals from massive unlabeled data to guide supervised learning. The state-of-the-art idea is to utilize hard negative samples that carry more useful information to form a better decision boundary. To balance efficiency and effectiveness, the vast majority of existing methods follow the two-pass approach, in which the first pass samples a fixed number of unobserved items by a simple static distribution and then the second pass selects the final negative items using a more sophisticated negative sampling strategy. However, selecting negative samples from the original items from a dataset is inherently limited due to the limited available choices, and thus may not be able to contrast positive samples well. In this paper, we confirm this observation via carefully designed experiments and introduce two major limitations of existing solutions: ambiguous trap and information discrimination. Our response to such limitations is to introduce “augmented” negative samples that may not exist in the original dataset. This direction renders a substantial technical challenge because constructing unconstrained negative samples may introduce excessive noise that eventually distorts the decision boundary. To this end, we introduce a novel generic augmented negative sampling (ANS) paradigm and provide a concrete instantiation. First, we disentangle the hard and easy factors of negative items. Next, we generate new candidate negative samples by augmenting only the easy factors in a regulated manner: the direction and magnitude of the augmentation are carefully calibrated. Finally, we design an advanced negative sampling strategy to identify the final augmented negative samples, which considers not only the score used in existing methods but also a new metric called augmentation gain. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

    <h3>Private Matrix Factorization with Public Item Features (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Walid Krichene, Mihaela Curmei, Li Zhang</p>
    <p>We consider the problem of training private recommendation models with access to public item features. Training with Differential Privacy (DP) offers strong privacy guarantees, at the expense of loss in recommendation quality. We show that incorporating public item features during training can help mitigate this loss in quality. We propose a general approach based on collective matrix factorization, that works by simultaneously factorizing two matrices: the user feedback matrix (representing sensitive data) and an item feature matrix that encodes publicly available (non-sensitive) item information. The method is conceptually simple, easy to tune, and highly scalable. It can be applied to different types of public data, including: (1) categorical item features; (2) item-item similarities learned from public sources; and (3) publicly available user feedback. Evaluating our method on a standard DP recommendation benchmark, we find that using public item features significantly narrows the quality gap between the private models and their non-private counterpart. As privacy constraints become more stringent, the increased reliance on public side features leads to recommendations becoming more depersonalized, resulting in a smooth transition from collaborative filtering to item-based contextual recommendations.</p>

    <h3>How Should We Measure Filter Bubbles? A Regression Model and Evidence for Online News (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Verachtert, Jens Leysen, Annelien Smets, Jorre Vannieuwenhuyze, Lien Michiels, Bart Goethals</p>
    <p>News media play an important role in democratic societies.  Central to fulfilling this role is the premise that users should be exposed to diverse news.  However, news recommender systems are gaining popularity on news websites, which has sparked concerns over filter bubbles. Editors, policy-makers and scholars are worried that news recommender systems may expose users to less diverse content over time.  To the best of our knowledge, this hypothesis has not been tested in a longitudinal observational study of real users that interact with a real news website. Such observational studies require the use of research methods that are robust and can account for the many covariates that may influence the diversity of recommendations at any given time. In this work, we propose an analysis model to study whether the variety of articles recommended to a user decreases over time, in observational studies of real news websites with real users. Further, we present results from two case studies using aggregated and anonymized data that were collected by two western European news websites employing a collaborative filtering-based news recommender system to serve (personalized) recommendations to their users. Through these case studies we validate empirically that our modeling assumptions are sound and supported by the data, and that our model obtains more reliable and interpretable results than analysis methods used in prior empirical work on filter bubbles. Our case studies provide evidence of a small decrease in the topic variety of a user’s recommendations in the first weeks after they sign up, but no evidence of a decrease in political variety.</p>

As such, this paper investigates whether more accurate recommendations from a content-based recommender or more diverse recommendations from a user-based collaborative filtering recommender will lead to more motivation to move. An eight-week longitudinal between-subject user study is being conducted with an Android app in which participants receive personalized recommendations for physical activities and tips to reduce sedentary behavior. The objective manipulation check confirmed that the group with collaborative filtering received significantly more diverse recommendations. The subjective manipulation check showed that the content-based group assigned more positive feedback for perceived accuracy and star rating to the recommendations they chose and executed. However, perceived diversity and inspiringness was significantly higher in the content-based group, suggesting that users might experience the recommendations differently. Lastly, momentary motivation for the executed activities and tips was significantly higher in the content-based group. As such, the preliminary results of this longitudinal study suggest that more accurate and less diverse recommendations have better effects on motivating users to move more.</p>

    <h3>LightSAGE: Graph Neural Networks for Large Scale Item Retrieval in Shopee’s Advertisement Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Zeng, Chenfei Wang, Yan Shen, Dang Minh Nguyen</p>
    <p>Graph Neural Network (GNN) is the trending solution for item retrieval in recommendation problems. Most recent reports, however, focus heavily on new model architectures. This may bring some gaps when applying GNN in the industrial setup, where, besides the model, constructing graph and handling data sparsity also play critical roles in the overall success of the project. In this work, we report how we apply GNN for large-scale e-commerce item retrieval at Shopee. We detail our simple yet novel and impactful techniques in graph construction, modeling, and handling data skewness. Specifically, we construct high-quality item graphs by combining strong-signal user behaviors with high-precision collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm. We then develop a new GNN architecture named LightSAGE to produce high-quality items’ embeddings for vector search. Finally, we develop multiple strategies to handle cold-start and long-tail items, which are critical in an advertisement (ads) system. Our models bring improvement in offline evaluations, online A/B tests, and are deployed to the main traffic of Shopee’s Recommendation Advertisement system.</p>
