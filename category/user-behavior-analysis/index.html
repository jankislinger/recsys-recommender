    <h3>Dynamic Stage-aware User Interest Learning for Heterogeneous Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhong Ming, Weixin Li, Xiaolin Lin, Weike Pan</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation has been widely used to predict users’ potential preferences by learning their dynamic user interests, for which most previous works focus on capturing item-level dependencies. Despite the great success, they often overlook the stage-level interest dependencies. In real-world scenarios, user interests tend to be staged, e.g., following an item purchase, a user’s interests may undergo a transition into the subsequent phase. And there are intricate dependencies across different stages. Meanwhile, users’ behaviors are usually heterogeneous, including auxiliary behaviors (e.g., examinations) and target behaviors (e.g., purchases), which imply more fine-grained user interests. However, existing works have limitations in explicitly modeling the relationships between auxiliary behaviors and target behaviors. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework, i.e., dynamic stage-aware user interest learning (DSUIL), for heterogeneous sequential recommendation, which is the first solution to model user interests in a cross-stage manner. Specifically, our DSUIL consists of three modules: a dynamic graph convolution module that dynamically learns item representations in each stage, a behavior-aware subgraph representation learning module that learns heterogeneous dependencies between behaviors and aggregates item representations to represent the user interests for each stage, and a sequence decoder to capture the evolving pattern of user interests and make item prediction. Extensive experimental results on two public datasets show that our DSUIL performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>A Multi-modal Modeling Framework for Cold-start Short-video Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Gai, Han Li, Ruina Sun, Jingjian Lin, Xinghua Zhang, Gaode Chen, Qi Zhang, Jiangxia Cao, Yuezihan Jiang</p>
    <p>Short video has witnessed rapid growth in the past few years in multimedia platforms. To ensure the freshness of the videos, platforms receive a large number of user-uploaded videos every day, making collaborative filtering-based recommender methods suffer from the item cold-start problem (e.g., the new-coming videos are difficult to compete with existing videos). Consequently, increasing efforts tackle the cold-start issue from the content perspective, focusing on modeling the multi-modal preferences of users, a fair way to compete with new-coming and existing videos. However, recent studies ignore the existing gap between multi-modal embedding extraction and user interest modeling as well as the discrepant intensities of user preferences for different modalities. In this paper, we propose M3CSR, a multi-modal modeling framework for cold-start short video recommendation. Specifically, we preprocess content-oriented multi-modal features for items and obtain trainable category IDs by performing clustering. In each modality, we combine modality-specific cluster ID embedding and the mapped original modality feature as modality-specific representation of the item to address the gap. Meanwhile, M3CSR measures the user modality-specific intensity based on the correlation between modality-specific interest and behavioral interest and employs pairwise loss to further decouple user multi-modal interests. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model. The framework has been deployed on a billion-user scale short video application and has shown improvements in various commercial metrics within cold-start scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Analyzing User Preferences and Quality Improvement on Bing’s WebPage Recommendation Experience with Large Language Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jialin Liu, Gang Luo, Hongzhi Li, Chuck Wang, Fan Wu, Amey Barapatre, Jaidev Shah</p>
    <p>Explore Further @ Bing (Web Recommendations) is a web-scale query independent webpage-to-webpage recommendation system with an index size of over 200 billion webpages. Due to the significant variability in webpage quality across the web and the reliance of our system on learning soleley user behavior (clicks), our production system was susceptible to serving clickbait and low-quality recommendations. Our team invested several months in developing and shipping several improvements that utilize LLM-generated recommendation quality labels to enhance our ranking stack to improve the nature of the recommendations we show to our users. Another key motivation behind our efforts was to go beyond merely surfacing relevant webpages, focusing instead on prioritizing more useful and authoritative content that delivers value to users based on their implied intent. We demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) offer a powerful tool for product teams to gain deeper insights into shifts in product experience and user behavior following significant improvements or changes to a production system. In this work, to enable our analysis, we also showcase the use of a small language model (SLM) to generate better-quality webpage text features and summaries at scale and describe our approach to mitigating position bias in user interaction logs.</p>

    <h3>Transformers Meet ACT-R: Repeat-Aware and Sequential Listening Session Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Sguerra, Viet-Anh Tran, Romain Hennequin, Guillaume Salha-Galvan</p>
    <p>Music streaming services often leverage sequential recommender systems to predict the best music to showcase to users based on past sequences of listening sessions. Nonetheless, most sequential recommendation methods ignore or insufficiently account for repetitive behaviors. This is a crucial limitation for music recommendation, as repeatedly listening to the same song over time is a common phenomenon, that can even change the way users perceive this song. In this paper, we introduce PISA (Psychology-Informed Session embedding using ACT-R), a session-level sequential recommender system that overcomes this limitation. PISA employs a Transformer architecture learning embedding representations of listening sessions and users using attention mechanisms inspired by Anderson’s ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Though-Rational), a cognitive architecture modeling human information access and memory dynamics. This approach enables us to capture dynamic and repetitive patterns from user behaviors, allowing us to effectively predict the songs they will listen to in subsequent sessions, whether they are repeated or new ones. We demonstrate the empirical relevance of PISA using public listening data from Last.fm and proprietary data from a global music streaming service, thereby confirming the critical importance of repetition modeling for sequential listening session recommendation. Along with this paper, we publicly release our proprietary dataset to foster future research in this field, as well as the source code of PISA to facilitate its future use.</p>

    <h3>A Dataset for Adapting Recommender Systems to the Fashion Rental Economy (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jivitesh Sharma, Karl Audun Borgersen, Morten Goodwin, Morten Grundetjern</p>
    <p>In response to the escalating ecological challenges that threaten global sustainability, there’s a deep need to investigate alternative methods of commerce, such as rental economies. Like most online commerce, rental or otherwise, a functioning recommender system is crucial for their success. Yet the domain has, until this point, been largely neglected by the recommender system research community. Our dataset, derived from our collaboration with the leading Norwegian fashion rental company [Company name omitted for review process], encompasses 64k transactions, rental histories from 2.2k anonymized users, and 15.8k unique outfits in which each physical item’s attributes and rental history is meticulously tracked. All outfits are listed as individual items or their corresponding item groups, referring to shared designs between the individual items. This approach underlines the novel challenges of rental as compared to more traditional recommender system problems where items are generally interchangeable. Each outfit is accompanied by a set of tags describing some of their attributes. We also provide a total of 50k images displaying across all items along with a set of precomputed zero-shot embeddings. We apply a myriad of common recommender system methods to the dataset to provide a performance baseline. This baseline is performed for the traditional fashion recommender system problem of recommending outfit groups and the novel problem of predicting individual item rental. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset discussing the domain of clothes rental. It is our hope that the publication of this dataset will serve as a catalyst for a new branch of research for specialized fashion rental recommender systems. The dataset is temporarily hosted at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/clothes_rental_dataset-B1E8/ and Google Cloud at https: //console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/clothes-rental-dataset The code for collecting, processing, and evaluating the dataset is hosted at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Vibrent_Dataset_Collection-03DC/</p>

    <h3>MODEM: Decoupling User Behavior for Shared-Account Video Recommendations on Large Screen Devices (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiang Li, Lantao Hu, Zhen Zhang, Xiang Feng, Yongqi Liu, Muyang Li</p>
    <p>In scenarios involving sequence recommendations on large screen devices, such as tablets or TVs, the equipment is often shared among multiple users. This sharing leads to a mixture of behaviors from different users, posing significant challenges to recommendation systems, especially when clear supervisory signals for distinguishing among users are absent. Current solutions tend to either operate in an unsupervised manner or rely on constructed supervisory signals that are not entirely reliable. Moreover, the peculiarities of short video recommendations in this context have not been thoroughly explored in existing research. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces Multi-User Contrastive Decoupling Model (MODEM), a novel short video recommendation model specifically designed for large screen devices. MODEM leverages an attention mechanism, grounded in session segmentation, to disentangle the intertwined user behavior histories. It also discriminates between the impacts of long and short viewing behaviors on short video recommendations by cross-analyzing sequences of both. Furthermore, we have developed a contrastive learning method to oversee the decoupling of user behaviors effectively. Our evaluations demonstrate noticeable improvements through both offline assessments within public datasets and online A/B testing within Kuaishou’s short video recommendation environment on large screen devices. Specifically, our online A/B tests resulted in a 0.55% increase in watch time. These results underscore MODEM’s efficacy in enhancing recommendation quality in shared account contexts.</p>

    <h3>Evaluating The Effects of Calibrated Popularity Bias Mitigation: A Field Study (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Astrid Tessem, Anastasiia Klimashevskaia, Dietmar Jannach, Lars Skjærven, Christoph Trattner, Mehdi Elahi</p>
    <p>Despite their proven various benefits, Recommender Systems can cause or amplify certain undesired effects. In this paper, we focus on Popularity Bias, i.e., the tendency of a recommender system to utilize the effect of recommending popular items to the user. Prior research has studied the negative impact of this type of bias on individuals and society as a whole and proposed various approaches to mitigate this in various domains. However, almost all works adopted offline methodologies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Unfortunately, such offline simulations can potentially be rather simplified and unable to capture the full picture. To contribute to this line of research and given a particular lack of knowledge about how debiasing approaches work not only offline, but online as well, we present in this paper the results of user study on a national broadcaster movie streaming platform in [country]1, i.e., [platform], following the A/B testing methodology. We deployed an effective mitigation approach for popularity bias, called Calibrated Popularity (CP), and monitored its performance in comparison to the platform’s existing collaborative filtering recommendation approach as a baseline over a period of almost four months. The results obtained from a large user base interacting in real-time with the recommendations indicate that the evaluated debiasing approach can be effective in addressing popularity bias while still maintaining the level of user interest and engagement</p>

    <p>Recommender systems are an essential component of online systems, providing users with a personalized experience. Some recommendation scenarios such as social networks or news are very dynamic, with new items added continuously and the interest of users changing over time due to breaking news or popular events. Incremental training is a popular technique to keep recommender models up-to-date in those dynamic platforms. In this paper, we provide an empirical analysis of a large industry dataset from the Sharechat app MOJ, a social media platform for short videos, to answer relevant questions like – how often should I retrain the model? – do different models, features and dataset sizes benefit from incremental training? – Do all users and items benefit the same from incremental training?</p>

    <h3>An Industrial Framework for Personalized Serendipitous Recommendation in E-commerce (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sulong Xu, Anyu Dai, Zhuoye Ding, Linfang Hou, Mian Ma, Luobao Zou, Yanyan Zou, Zongyi Wang, Nan Qiao</p>
    <p>Classical recommendation methods typically face the filter bubble problem where users likely receive recommendations of their familiar items, making them bored and dissatisfied. To alleviate such an issue, this applied paper introduces a novel framework for personalized serendipitous recommendation in an e-commerce platform (i.e., JD.com), which allows to present user unexpected and satisfying items deviating from user’s prior behaviors, considering both accuracy and novelty. To achieve such a goal, it is crucial yet challenging to recognize when a user is willing to receive serendipitous items and how many novel items are expected. To address above two challenges, a two-stage framework is designed. Firstly, a DNN-based scorer is deployed to quantify the novelty degree of a product category based on user behavior history. Then, we resort to a potential outcome framework to decide the optimal timing to recommend a user serendipitous items and the novelty degree of the recommendation. Online A/B test on the e-commerce recommender platform in JD.com demonstrates that our model achieves significant gains on various metrics, 0.54% relative increase of impressive depth, 0.8% of average user click count, 3.23%  and 1.38% of number of novel impressive and clicked items individually.</p>

    <h3>Equivariant Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yueqi Xie, Yining Hua, Sunghun Kim, Jaeboum Kim, Shoujin Wang, Jingqi Gao, Qichen Ye, Peilin Zhou</p>
    <p>Contrastive learning (CL) benefits the training of sequential recommendation models with informative self-supervision signals. Existing solutions apply general sequential data augmentation strategies to generate positive pairs and encourage their representations to be invariant. However, due to the inherent properties of user behavior sequences, some augmentation strategies, such as item substitution, can lead to changes in user intent. Learning indiscriminately invariant representations for all augmentation strategies might be sub-optimal. Therefore, we propose Equivariant Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation (ECL-SR), which endows SR models with great discriminative power, making the learned user behavior representations sensitive to invasive augmentations (e.g., item substitution) and insensitive to mild augmentations (e.g., feature-level dropout masking). In detail, we use the conditional discriminator to capture differences in behavior due to item substitution, which encourages the user behavior encoder to be equivariant to invasive augmentations. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed ECL-SR framework achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art SR models. The source code will be released.</p>

    <h3>Beyond the Sequence: Statistics-driven Pre-training for Stabilizing Sequential Recommendation Model (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongzhi Zhang, Sirui Wang, Yunsen Xian, Peiguang Li</p>
    <p>The sequential recommendation task aims to predict the item that user is interested in according to his/her historical action sequence. However, inevitable random action, i.e. user randomly accesses an item among multiple candidates or clicks several items at random order, cause the sequence fails to provide stable and high-quality signals. To alleviate the issue, we propose the StatisTics-Driven Pre-traing framework (called STDP briefly). The main idea of the work lies in the exploration of utilizing the statistics information along with the pre-training paradigm to stabilize the optimization of recommendation model. Specifically, we derive two types of statistical information: item co-occurrence across sequence and attribute frequency within the sequence. And we design the following pre-training tasks: 1) The co-occurred items prediction task, which encourages the model to distribute its attention on multiple suitable targets instead of just focusing on the next item that may be unstable. 2) We generate a paired sequence by replacing items with their co-occurred items and enforce its representation close with the original one, thus enhancing the model’s robustness to the random noise. 3) To reduce the impact of random on user’s long-term preferences, we encourage the model to capture sequence-level frequent attributes. The significant improvement over six datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposal, and further analysis verified the generalization of the STDP framework on other models.</p>

    <h3>KGTORe: Tailored Recommendations through Knowledge-aware GNN Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salvatore Bufi, Eugenio Di Sciascio, Tommaso Di Noia, Daniele Malitesta, Antonio Ferrara, Alberto Carlo Maria Mancino</p>
    <p>Knowledge graphs (KG) have been proven to be a powerful source of side information to enhance the performance of recommendation algorithms. Their graph-based structure paves the way for the adoption of graph-aware learning models such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this respect, state-of-the-art models achieve good performance and interpretability via user-level combinations of intents leading users to their choices. Unfortunately, such results often come from and end-to-end learnings that considers a combination of the whole set of features contained in the KG without any analysis of the user decisions. In this paper, we introduce KGTORe, a GNN-based model that exploits KG to learn latent representations for the semantic features, and consequently, interpret the user decisions as a personal distillation of the item feature representations. Differently from previous models, KGTORe does not need to process the whole KG at training time but relies on a selection of the most discriminative features for the users, thus resulting in improved performance and personalization. Experimental results on three well-known datasets show that KGTORe achieves remarkable accuracy performance and several ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of its components.</p>

    <p>The analysis and mining of user heterogeneous behavior are of paramount importance in recommendation systems. However, the conventional approach of incorporating various types of heterogeneous behavior into recommendation models leads to feature sparsity and knowledge fragmentation issues. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for personalized recommendation via Large Language Model (LLM), by extracting and fusing heterogeneous knowledge from user heterogeneous behavior information. In addition, by combining heterogeneous knowledge and recommendation tasks, instruction tuning is performed on LLM for personalized recommendations. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate user heterogeneous behavior and significantly improve recommendation performance.</p>

    <p>The negative effects of misinformation filter bubbles in adaptive systems have been known to researchers for some time. Several studies investigated, most prominently on YouTube, how fast a user can get into a misinformation filter bubble simply by selecting “wrong choices” from the items offered. Yet, no studies so far have investigated what it takes to “burst the bubble”, i.e., revert the bubble enclosure. We present a study in which pre-programmed agents (acting as YouTube users) delve into misinformation filter bubbles by watching misinformation promoting content (for various topics). Then, by watching misinformation debunking content, the agents try to burst the bubbles and reach more balanced recommendation mixes. We recorded the search results and recommendations, which the agents encountered, and analyzed them for the presence of misinformation. Our key finding is that bursting of a filter bubble is possible, albeit it manifests differently from topic to topic. Moreover, we observe that filter bubbles do not truly appear in some situations. We also draw a direct comparison with a previous study. Sadly, we did not find much improvements in misinformation occurrences, despite recent pledges by YouTube.</p>
