    <h3>Investigating the effects of incremental training on neural ranking models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenzhe Shi, Gilberto Titericz, Kazuki Onodera, Gabriel de Souza Pereira Moreira, Praveen Dhinwa, Chris Deotte, Even Oldridge, Vishal Agrawal, Chris Green, Benedikt Schifferer</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are an essential component of online systems, providing users with a personalized experience. Some recommendation scenarios such as social networks or news are very dynamic, with new items added continuously and the interest of users changing over time due to breaking news or popular events. Incremental training is a popular technique to keep recommender models up-to-date in those dynamic platforms. In this paper, we provide an empirical analysis of a large industry dataset from the Sharechat app MOJ, a social media platform for short videos, to answer relevant questions like – how often should I retrain the model? – do different models, features and dataset sizes benefit from incremental training? – Do all users and items benefit the same from incremental training?</p>

    <h3>Do recommender systems make social media more susceptible to misinformation spreaders? (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonela Tommasel, Filippo Menczer</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are central to online information consumption and user-decision processes, as they help users find relevant information and establish new social relationships. However, recommenders could also (unintendedly) help propagate misinformation and increase the social influence of the spreading it. In this context, we study the impact of friend recommender systems on the social influence of misinformation spreaders on Twitter. To this end, we applied several user recommenders to a COVID-19 misinformation data collection. Then, we explore what-if scenarios to simulate changes in user misinformation spreading behaviour as an effect of the interactions in the recommended network. Our study shows that recommenders can indeed affect how misinformation spreaders interact with other users and influence them.</p>

    <h3>A Gradient-based Adaptive Learning Framework for Efficient Personal Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liangjie Hong, Yue Shi, Naren Ramakrishnan, Huzefa Rangwala, Yue Ning</p>
    <p>Recommending personalized content to users is a long-standing challenge to many online services including Facebook, Yahoo, Linkedin and Twitter. Traditional recommendation models such as latent factor models and feature-based models are usually trained for all users and optimize an “average” experience for them, yielding sub-optimal solutions. Although multi-task learning provides an opportunity to learn personalized models per user, learning algorithms are usually tailored to specific models (e.g., generalized linear model, matrix factorization and etc.), creating obstacles for a unified engineering interface, which is important for large Internet companies. In this paper, we present an empirical framework to learn user-specific personal models for content recommendation by utilizing gradient information from a global model. Our proposed method can potentially benefit any model that can be optimized through gradients, offering a lightweight yet generic alternative to conventional multi-task learning algorithms for user personalization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by incorporating it in three popular machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, gradient boosting decision tree and matrix factorization. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that the proposed framework can significantly improve the efficiency of personalized recommendation in real-world datasets.</p>

    <h3>TAPER: A Contextual Tensor-Based Approach for Personalized Expert Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hancheng Ge, Haokai Lu, James Caverlee</p>
    <p>We address the challenge of personalized recommendation of high quality content producers in social media. While some candidates are easily identifiable (say, by being “favorited” many times), there is a long-tail of potential candidates for whom we have little evidence. Through careful modeling of contextual factors like the geo-spatial, topical, and social preferences of users, we propose a tensor-based personalized expert recommendation framework that integrates these factors for revealing latent connections between homogeneous entities (e.g., users and users) and between heterogeneous entities (e.g., users and experts). Through extensive experiments over geo-tagged Twitter data, we find that the proposed framework can improve the quality of recommendation by over 30% in both precision and recall compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

    <h3>Personality-Based Recommendations: Evidence from Amazon.com (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Panagiotis Adamopoulos, Vilma Todri</p>
    <p>In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of personality-based recommendations using a real-world data set from Amazon.com. We automatically infer the personality traits, needs, and values of users based on unstructured user-generated content in social media, rather than administering questionnaires or explicitly asking the users to self-report their characteristics. We find that personality characteristics significantly increase the performance of recommender systems, in general, while different personality models exhibit statistically significant differences in predictive performance.</p>

    <h3>Crowd Sourcing, with a Few Answers: Recommending Commuters for Traffic Updates (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Berlingerio, François Schnitzler, Elizabeth M. Daly</p>
    <p>Real-time traffic awareness applications are playing an ever increasing role understanding and tackling traffic congestion in cities. First-hand accounts from drivers witnessing an incident is an invaluable source of information for traffic managers. Nowadays, drivers increasingly contact control rooms through social media to report on journey times, accidents or road weather conditions. These new interactions allow traffic controllers to engage users, and in particular to query them for information rather than passively collecting it. Querying articipants presents the challenge of which users to probe for updates about a specific situation. In order to maximise the probability of a user responding and the accuracy of the information, we propose a strategy which takes into account the engagement levels of the user, the mobility profile and the reputation of the user. We provide an analysis of a real-world user corpus of Twitter users contributing updates to LiveDrive, a Dublin based traffic radio station.</p>

    <h3>Scalable Audience Targeted Models for Brand Advertising on Social Networks (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kunpeng Zhang</p>
    <p>People are using social media to generate, share, and communicate information with each other. Finding actionable insights from such big data has attracted a lot of research attentions on, for example, finding targeted user groups based on their historical on-line activities. However, existing machine learning algorithms fail to keep up with the increasing large data volume. In this paper, we develop a scalable regression-based algorithm called distributed iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (DISTA) that can identify potential users. Our experiments conducted on Facebook data containing billions of users and associated activities show that DISTA with feature selection not only enables on-line audience-targeted approach for precise marketing but also performs efficiently on parallel computers.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Sentiment Homophily for Link Prediction (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Munindar Singh, Pradeep Murukannaiah, Guangchao Yuan, Zhe Zhang</p>
    <p>Link prediction system has been extensively studied and adopted to recommendation systems on social media. With the increasing popularity of sentiment analysis on social network, knowing the relationship between users’ sentiments and link prediction is important. In this paper, we study how to exploit sentiment homophily in link prediction. We have gathered political campaign dataset of one-month on Twitter. We define a set of sentiment-based features that quantify the likelihood of two users becoming friends based on their sentiments toward topics. Our evaluation in a supervised learning framework demonstrates the benefits of sentiment-based features in link prediction. Further, Adamic-Adar and Euclidean distance based measures are the best predictors. We propose a factor graph model that incorporates the sentiment-based cognitive balance theory. Our evaluation shows how our model offers help in link prediction on different kinds of graphs, compared to traditional machine learning techniques. Our work offers new insights for real-world link recommendation systems.</p>

    <h3>Emphasize, Don’t Filter! Displaying Recommendations in Twitter Timelines (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julita Vassileva, Wesley Waldner</p>
    <p>This paper describes and evaluates a method for presenting recommendations that will increase the efficiency of the social activity stream while preserving the users’ accurate awareness of the activity within their own social networks. With the help of a content-based recommender system, the application displays the user’s home timeline in Twitter as three visually distinct tiers by emphasizing more strongly those Tweets predicted to be more interesting. Pilot study participants reported that they were able to read the interesting Tweets while ignoring the others with relative ease and that the recommender accurately categorized their Tweets into three tiers.</p>

    <h3>Content Ordering Based On Commuting Patterns (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Alonso, Travis Gingerich</p>
    <p>Recommender systems take into account a wide range of information about both an individual user and other user's preferences in order to provide relevant content. However, one source of information that appears to be under-utilized is contextual information about the users' trajectory: where they are currently located, and where they are traveling to. We demonstrate a system that recommends the reading order of Twitter content based on the user's planned travel.</p>

    <h3>Recommending Tumblr Blogs to Follow with Inductive Matrix Completion (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donghyuk Shin, Suleyman Cetintas, Kuang-Chih Lee</p>
    <p>In microblogging sites, recommending blogs (users) to follow is one of the core tasks for enhancing user experience. In this paper, we propose a novel inductive matrix completion based blog recommendation method to effectively utilize multiple rich sources of evidence such as the social network and the content as well as the activity data from users and blogs. Experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset from Tumblr show the effectiveness of the proposed blog recommendation method.</p>
