    <h3>Of Spiky SVDs and Music Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darius Afchar, Romain Hennequin, Vincent Guigue</p>
    <p>The truncated singular value decomposition is a widely used methodology in music recommendation for direct similar-item retrieval or embedding musical items for downstream tasks. This paper investigates a curious effect that we show naturally occurring on many recommendation datasets: spiking formations in the embedding space. We first propose a metric to quantify this spiking organization’s strength, then mathematically prove its origin tied to underlying communities of items of varying internal popularity. With this new-found theoretical understanding, we finally open the topic with an industrial use case of estimating how music embeddings’ top-k similar items will change over time under the addition of data.</p>

    <h3>Towards Recommender Systems with Community Detection and Quantum Computing (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Cremonesi, Riccardo Nembrini, Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema, Costantino Carugno</p>
    <p>After decades of being mainly confined to theoretical research, Quantum Computing is now becoming a useful tool for solving realistic problems. This work aims to experimentally explore the feasibility of using currently available quantum computers, based on the Quantum Annealing paradigm, to build a recommender system exploiting community detection. Community detection, by partitioning users and items into densely connected clusters, can boost the accuracy of non-personalized recommendation by assuming that users within each community share similar tastes. However, community detection is a computationally expensive process. The recent availability of Quantum Annealers as cloud-based devices, constitutes a new and promising direction to explore community detection, although effectively leveraging this new technology is a long-term path that still requires advancements in both hardware and algorithms. This work aims to begin this path by assessing the quality of community detection formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem on a real recommendation scenario. Results on several datasets show that the quantum solver is able to detect communities of comparable quality with respect to classical solvers, but with better speedup, and the non-personalized recommendation models built on top of these communities exhibit improved recommendation quality. The takeaway is that quantum computing, although in its early stages of maturity and applicability, shows promise in its ability to support new recommendation models and to bring improved scalability as technology evolves.</p>

    <h3>I want to break free! Recommending friends from outside the echo chamber (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniela Godoy, Antonela Tommasel, Juan Manuel Rodriguez</p>
    <p>Recommender systems serve as mediators of information consumption and propagation. In this role, these systems have been recently criticized for introducing biases and promoting the creation of echo chambers and filter bubbles, thus lowering the diversity of both content and potential new social relations users are exposed to. Some of these issues are a consequence of the fundamental concepts on which recommender systems are based on. Assumptions like the homophily principle might lead users to content that they already like or friends they already know, which can be naïve in the era of ideological uniformity and fake news. A significant challenge in this context is how to effectively learn the dynamic representations of users based on the content they share and their echo chamber or community interactions to recommend potentially relevant and diverse friends from outside the network of influence of the users’ echo chamber. To address this, we devise FRediECH (a Friend RecommenDer for breakIng Echo CHambers), an echo chamber-aware friend recommendation approach that learns users and echo chamber representations from the shared content and past users’ and communities’ interactions. Comprehensive evaluations over Twitter data showed that our approach achieved better performance (in terms of relevance and novelty) than state-of-the-art alternatives, validating its effectiveness.</p>

    <h3>Overlapping Community Regularization for Rating Prediction in Social Recommender Systems (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dingming Wu, Nikos Mamoulis, Wenbin Tang, Hui Li</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have become de facto tools for suggesting items that are of potential interest to users. Predicting a user’s rating on an item is the fundamental recommendation task. Traditional methods that generate predictions by analyzing the user-item rating matrix perform poorly when the matrix is sparse. Recent approaches use data from social networks to improve accuracy. However, most of the social-network based recommender systems only consider direct friendships and they are less effective when the targeted user has few social connections. In this paper, we propose two alternative models that incorporate the overlapping community regularization into the matrix factorization framework. Our empirical study on four real datasets shows that our approaches outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in both traditional and social-network based recommender systems regarding both cold-start users and normal users.</p>
