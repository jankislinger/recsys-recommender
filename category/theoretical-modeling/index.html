    <h3>The Fault in Our Recommendations: On the Perils of Optimizing the Measurable (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshit Kumar, Yash Kanoria, Omar Besbes</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems play a pivotal role on digital platforms by curating content, products and services for users. These systems are widespread, and through customized recommendations, promise to match users with options they will like. To that end,  data on engagement is collected and used, with, e.g., measurements of clicks, but also  purchases or consumption times.   Most recommendation systems are ranking-based, where they rank and recommend items based on their predicted engagement.  However, the engagement signals  are often only a crude proxy for user utility, as data on the latter is rarely collected or available. This paper explores the following critical research question: By optimizing for measurable proxies, are recommendation systems at risk of significantly under-delivering on user utility? If that is indeed the case, how can one improve utility which is seldom measured? To study these questions, we introduce a model of repeated user consumption in which, at each interaction, users select between an outside option and the best option from a recommendation set. Our model accounts for user heterogeneity, with the majority preferring “popular” content, and a minority favoring “niche” content. The system initially lacks knowledge of individual user preferences but can learn these preferences through observations of users’ choices over time. Our theoretical and numerical analysis demonstrate that optimizing for engagement signals can lead to significant utility losses. Instead, we propose a utility-aware policy that initially recommends a mix of popular and niche content. We show that such a policy substantially improves  utility despite not measuring it. In fact, in the limit of a forward-looking platform with discount factor $\delta \to 1$, our utility-aware policy achieves the best of both worlds: near-optimal user utility and near-optimal engagement simultaneously. Our study elucidates  an important feature of recommendation systems; given the ability to suggest multiple items, one can perform significant exploration without incurring significant reductions in short term engagement. By recommending high-risk, high-reward items alongside popular items, systems can enhance discovery of high utility items without significantly affecting engagement.</p>

    <h3>Theoretical Modeling of the Iterative Properties of User Discovery in a Collaborative Filtering Recommender System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boujelbene Mariem, Olfa Nasraoui, Sami Khenissi</p>
    <p>The closed feedback loop in recommender systems is a common setting that can lead to different types of biases. Several studies have dealt with these biases by designing methods to mitigate their effect on the recommendations. However, most existing studies do not consider the iterative behavior of the system where the closed feedback loop plays a crucial role in incorporating different biases into several parts of the recommendation steps.<br>We present a theoretical framework to model the asymptotic evolution of the different components of a recommender system operating within a feedback loop setting, and derive theoretical bounds and convergence properties on quantifiable measures of the user discovery and blind spots. We also validate our theoretical findings empirically using a real-life dataset and empirically test the efficiency of a basic exploration strategy within our theoretical framework.<br>Our findings lay the theoretical basis for quantifying the effect of feedback loops and for designing Artificial Intelligence and machine learning algorithms that explicitly incorporate the iterative nature of feedback loops in the machine learning and recommendation process.</p>
