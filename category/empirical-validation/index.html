    <h3>Tops, Bottoms, and Shoes: Building Capsule Wardrobes via Cross-Attention Tensor Network (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Yang, Fei Wang, Yusan Lin, Huiyuan Chen</p>
    <p>Fashion is more than Paris runways. Fashion is about how people express their interests, identity, mood, and cultural influences. Given an inventory of candidate garments from different categories, how to assemble them together would most improve their fashionability? This question presents an intriguing visual recommendation challenge to automatically create capsule wardrobes. Capsule wardrobe generation is a complex combinatorial problem that requires the understanding of how multiple visual items interact. The generative process often needs fashion experts to manually tease the combinations out, making it hard to scale.<br>We introduce TensorNet, an approach that captures the key ingredients of visual compatibility among tops, bottoms, and shoes. TensorNet aims to provide actionable advice for full-body clothing outfits that mix and match well. Our TensorNet consists of two core modules: a Cross-Attention Message Passing module and a Wide&Deep Tensor Interaction module. As such, TensorNet is able to characterize the local region-based patterns as well as the global compatibility of the entire outfits. Our experimental results on the real-word datasets indicate that the proposed method is capable of learning visual compatibility and outperforms all the baselines. TensorNet opens up opportunities for fashion designers to narrow down the search space for multi-clothes combinations.</p>

    <h3>Local Item-Item Models For Top-N Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> George Karypis, Evangelia Christakopoulou</p>
    <p>Item-based approaches based on SLIM (Sparse LInear Methods) have demonstrated very good performance for top-N recommendation; however they only estimate a single model for all the users. This work is based on the intuition that not all users behave in the same way â€” instead there exist subsets of like-minded users. By using different item-item models for these user subsets, we can capture differences in their preferences and this can lead to improved performance for top-N recommendations. In this work, we extend SLIM by combining global and local SLIM models. We present a method that computes the prediction scores as a user-specific combination of the predictions derived by a global and local item-item models. We present an approach in which the global model, the local models, their user-specific combination, and the assignment of users to the local models are jointly optimized to improve the top-N recommendation performance. Our experiments show that the proposed method improves upon the standard SLIM model and outperforms competing top-N recommendation approaches.</p>
