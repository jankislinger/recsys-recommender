    <h3>Folding: Why Good Models Sometimes Make Spurious Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Mayoraz, Karthik Lakshmanan, John R. Anderson, Hubert Pham, Doris Xin</p>
    <p>In recommender systems based on low rank factorization of a partially observed user-item matrix, a common phenomenon that plagues many otherwise effective models is the interleaving of good and spurious recommendations in the top-K results. A single incongruous recommendation can dramatically impact the perceived quality of a recommender system. In this work, we investigate folding, a major contributing factor to spurious recommendations. Folding refers to the unintentional overlap of disparate groups of users and items in the low-rank embedding vector space, induced by improper handling of missing data. We formally define a metric that quantifies the severity of folding in a trained system, to assist in diagnosing its potential to shock users with inappropriate recommendations. The folding metric complements existing information retrieval metrics that focus on the number of good recommendations and their ranks but ignore the impact of undesired recommendations. We motivate our definition of the folding metric on synthetic data and evaluate its effectiveness on both synthetic and real world datasets. We study the relationship between the folding metric and other characteristics of recommender systems and observe that optimizing for goodness metrics can lead to high folding and thus more spurious recommendations.</p>

    <h3>`Free Lunch’ Enhancement for Collaborative Filtering with Factorization Machines (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martha Larson, Alan Hanjalic, Babak Loni, Alan Said</p>
    <p>The advantage of Factorization Machines over other factorization models is their ability to easily integrate and efficiently exploit auxiliary information to improve Collaborative Filtering. Until now, this auxiliary information has been drawn from external knowledge sources beyond the user-item matrix. In this paper, we demonstrate that Factorization Machines can exploit additional representations of information inherent in the user-item matrix to improve recommendation performance. We refer to our approach as “Free Lunch” enhancement since it leverages clusters that are based on information that is present in the user-item matrix, but not otherwise directly exploited during matrix factorization. Borrowing clustering concepts from codebook sharing, our approach can also make use of “Free Lunch” information inherent in a user-item matrix from a auxiliary domain that is different from the target domain of the recommender. Our approach improves performance both in the joint case, in which the auxiliary and target domains share users, and in the disjoint case, in which they do not. Although “Free Lunch” enhancement does not apply equally well to any given domain or domain combination, our overall conclusion is that Factorization Machines present an opportunity to exploit information that is ubiquitously present, but commonly under-appreciated by Collaborative Filtering algorithms.</p>
