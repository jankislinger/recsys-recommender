    <h3>A Novel Graph-based Model for Hybrid Recommendations in Cold-start Scenarios (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesare Bernardis, Paolo Cremonesi, Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema</p>
    <p>Cold-start is a very common and still open problem in the Recommender Systems literature. Since cold start items do not have any interaction, collaborative algorithms are not applicable. One of the main strategies is to use pure or hybrid content-based approaches, which usually yield to lower recommendation quality than collaborative ones. Some techniques to optimize performance of this type of approaches have been studied in recent past. One of them is called feature weighting, which assigns to every feature a real value, called weight, that estimates its importance. Statistical techniques for feature weighting commonly used in Information Retrieval, like TF-IDF, have been adapted for Recommender Systems, but they often do not provide sufficient quality improvements. More recent approaches, FBSM and LFW, estimate weights by leveraging collaborative information via machine learning, in order to learn the importance of a feature based on other users opinions. This type of models have shown promising results compared to classic statistical analyzes cited previously. We propose a novel graph, feature-based machine learning model to face the cold-start item scenario, learning the relevance of features from probabilities of item-based collaborative filtering algorithms.</p>

    <h3>Do Users Matter? The Contribution of User-Driven Feature Weights to Open Dataset Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anusuriya Devaraju, Shlomo Berkovsky</p>
    <p>The vast volumes of open data pose a challenge for users in finding relevant datasets. To address this, we developed a hybrid dataset recommendation model that combines content-based similarity with item-to-item co-occurrence. The features used by the recommender include dataset properties and usage statistics. In this paper, we focus on fi ne-tuning the weights of these features. We experimentally compare two feature weighting approaches: a uniform one with predefined weights and a user-driven one, where the weights are informed by the opinions of system users. We evaluated the two approaches in a study, involving the users of a real-life data portal. The results suggest that user-driven feature weights can improve dataset recommendations, although not at all levels of data relevance, and highlight the importance of incorporating target users in the design of recommender systems.</p>
