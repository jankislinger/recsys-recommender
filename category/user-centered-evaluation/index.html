    <h3>A User-Centered Investigation of Personal Music Tours (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Gabbolini, Derek Bridge</p>
    <p>Streaming services use recommender systems to surface the right music to users. Playlists are a popular way to present music in a list-like fashion, i.e. as a plain list of songs. An alternative are tours, where the songs alternate with segues, which explain the connections between consecutive songs. Tours address the user need of seeking background information about songs, and are found to be superior to playlists, given the right user context. In this work, we provide, for the first time, a user-centered evaluation of two tour-generation algorithms (Greedy and Optimal) using semi-structured interviews. We assess the algorithms, we discuss attributes of the tours that the algorithms produce, we identify which attributes are desirable and which are not, and we enumerate several possible improvements to the algorithms, along with practical suggestions on how to implement the improvements. Our main findings are that Greedy generates more likeable tours than Optimal, and that three important attributes of tours are segue diversity, song arrangement and song familiarity. More generally, we provide insights into how to present music to users, which could inform the design of user-centered recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>User-Centered Evaluation of Strategies for Recommending Sequences of Points of Interest to Groups (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wolfgang WÃ¶rndl, Daniel Herzog</p>
    <p>Most recommender systems (RSs) predict the preferences of individual users; however, in certain scenarios, recommendations need to be made for a group of users. Tourism is a popular domain for group recommendations because people often travel in groups and look for point of interest (POI) sequences for their visits during a trip. In this study, we present different strategies that can be used to recommend POI sequences for groups. In addition, we introduce novel approaches, including a strategy called Split Group, which allows groups to split into smaller groups during a trip. We compared all strategies in a user study with 40 real groups. Our results proved that there was a significant difference in the quality of recommendations generated by using the different strategies. Most groups were willing to split temporarily during a trip, even when they were traveling with persons close to them. In this case, Split Group generated the best recommendations for different evaluation criteria. We use these findings to propose improvements for group recommendation strategies in the tourism domain.</p>

    <h3>Contrasting Offline and Online Results when Evaluating Recommendation Algorithms (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Rossetti, Fabio Stella, Markus Zanker</p>
    <p>Most evaluations of novel algorithmic contributions assess their accuracy in predicting what was withheld in an offline evaluation scenario. However, several doubts have been raised that standard offline evaluation practices are not appropriate to select the best algorithm for field deployment. The goal of this work is therefore to compare the offline and the online evaluation methodology with the same study participants, i.e. a within users experimental design. This paper presents empirical evidence that the ranking of algorithms based on offline accuracy measurements clearly contradicts the results from the online study with the same set of users. Thus the external validity of the most commonly applied evaluation methodology is not guaranteed.</p>
