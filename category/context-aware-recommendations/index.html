    <h3>MAWI Rec: Leveraging Severe Weather Data in Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Surya Kallumadi, Julian Mcauley, Brendan Duncan</p>
    <p>Inferring user intent in recommender systems can help performance but is difficult because intent is personal and not directly observable. Previous work has leveraged signals to stand as a proxy for intent (e.g. user interactions with resource pages), but such signals are not always available. In this paper, we instead recognize that certain events, which are observable, directly influence user intent. For example, after a flood, home improvement customers are more likely to undertake a renovation project to dry out their basement. We introduce MAWI Rec, a recommender system that leverages severe weather data to improve recommendation. Our weather-aware system achieves a significant improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline for online and in-store datasets of home improvement customers. This gain is most significant for weather-related product categories such as roof panels and flashings.</p>

    <h3>CAPRI-FAIR: Integration of Multi-sided Fairness in Contextual POI Recommendation Framework (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yonchanok Khaokaew, Jeffrey Chan, Flora D. Salim, Francis Dela Cruz</p>
    <p>Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation, a form of context-aware recommendation, takes into account spatio-temporal constraints and contexts like distance, peak business hours, and previous user check-ins. Given the ability of these kinds of systems to influence not just the consumer’s travel experience, but also the POI’s business, it is important to consider fairness from multiple perspectives. Unfortunately, these systems tend to provide less accurate recommendations to inactive users, and less exposure to unpopular POIs. The goal of this paper is to develop a post-filter methodology that incorporates provider and consumer fairness factors into pre-existing recommendation models, to satisfy fairness metrics like item exposure, and performance metrics like precision and distance, making the system more sustainable to both consumers and providers. Experiments have shown that using a linear scoring model for provider fairness in re-scoring recommended items yields the best tradeoff between performance and long-tail exposure, in some cases without a significant decrease in precision. When attempting to address consumer fairness by recommending more popular POIs to inactive users, the result was an increase in precision for only some recommendation models and datasets. Finally, when considering the tradeoff between both parameters, the combinations that reached the Pareto front of consumer and provider fairness, unfortunately, achieved the lowest precision values. We find that the nature of this tradeoff depends heavily on the model and the dataset.</p>

    <h3>ReChorus2.0: A Modular and Task-Flexible Recommendation Library (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peijie Sun, Hanyu Li, Zhiyu He, Weizhi Ma, Shaoping Ma, Min Zhang, Jiayu Li</p>
    <p>With the applications of recommendation systems rapidly expanding, an increasing number of studies have focused on every aspect of recommender systems with different data inputs, models, and task settings. Therefore, a flexible library is needed to help researchers implement the experimental strategies they require. Existing open libraries for recommendation scenarios have enabled reproducing various recommendation methods and provided standard implementations. However, these libraries often impose certain restrictions on data and seldom support the same model to perform different tasks and input formats, limiting users from customized explorations. To fill the gap, we propose ReChorus2.0, a modular and task-flexible library for recommendation researchers. Based on ReChorus, we upgrade the supported input formats, models, and training\&evaluation strategies to help realize more recommendation tasks with more data types. The main contributions of ReChorus2.0 include:    (1) Realization of complex and practical tasks, including reranking and CTR prediction tasks;   (2) Inclusion of various context-aware and rerank recommenders;   (3) Extension of existing and new models to support different tasks with the same models;   (4) Support of highly-customized input with impression logs, negative items, or click labels, as well as user, item, and situation contexts.   To summarize, ReChorus2.0 serves as a comprehensive and flexible library better aligning with the practical problems in the recommendation scenario and catering to more diverse research needs. The implementation and detailed tutorials of ReChorus2.0 can be found at https://github.com/THUwangcy/ReChorus.</p>

    <h3>CR-SoRec: BERT driven Consistency Regularization for Social Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raksha Jalan, Naoyuki Onoe, Tushar Prakash, Brijraj Singh</p>
    <p>In the real world, when we seek our friends’ opinions on various items or events, we request verbal social recommendations. It has been observed that we often turn to our friends for recommendations on a daily basis. The emergence of online social platforms has enabled users to share their opinion with their social connections. Therefore, we should consider users’ social connections to enhance online recommendation performance. The social recommendation aims to fuse social links with user-item interactions to offer more relevant recommendations. Several efforts have been made to develop an effective social recommendation system. However, there are two significant limitations to current methods: First, they haven’t thoroughly explored the intricate relationships between the diverse influences of neighbours on users’ preferences. Second, existing models are vulnerable to overfitting due to the relatively low number of user-item interaction records in the interaction space. For the aforementioned problems,  this paper offers a novel framework called CR-SoRec, an effective recommendation model based on BERT and Consistency Regularization. This model incorporates Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer(BERT) to learn bidirectional context-aware user and item embeddings with neighbourhood sampling. The neighbourhood Sampling technique samples the most influential neighbours for all the users/ items. Further, to effectively use the available user-item interaction data and social ties, we leverage diverse perspectives via consistency regularisation to harness the underlying information. The main objective of our model is to predict the next item that a user would interact with based on its interaction behaviour and social connections. Experimental results show that our model defines a new state-of-the-art on various datasets and outperforms previous work by a significant margin. Extensive experiments are conducted to analyse the method. We release the source code of our model at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CR-SoRec-68F4</p>

    <h3>Unleash the Power of Context: Enhancing Large-Scale Recommender Systems with Context-Based Prediction Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davorin Kopič, Jan Hartman, Assaf Klein, Natalia Silberstein</p>
    <p>In this work, we introduce the notion of Context-Based Prediction Models. A Context-Based Prediction Model determines the probability of a user’s action (such as a click or a conversion) solely by relying on user and contextual features, without considering any specific features of the item itself. We have identified numerous valuable applications for this modeling approach, including training an auxiliary context-based model to estimate click probability and incorporating its prediction as a feature in CTR prediction models.Our experiments indicate that this enhancement brings significant improvements in offline and online business metrics while having minimal impact on the cost of serving. Overall, our work offers a simple and scalable, yet powerful approach for enhancing the performance of large-scale commercial recommender systems, with broad implications for the field of personalized recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Global Sensitivity for Differentially Private Contextual Bandits (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongning Wang, David B. Zhao, Huazheng Wang</p>
    <p>Bandit algorithms have become a reference solution for interactive recommendation. However, as such algorithms directly interact with users for improved recommendations, serious privacy concerns have been raised regarding its practical use. In this work, we propose a differentially private linear contextual bandit algorithm, via a tree-based mechanism to add Laplace or Gaussian noise to model parameters. Our key insight is that as the model converges during online update, the global sensitivity of its parameters shrinks over time (thus named dynamic global sensitivity). Compared with existing solutions, our dynamic global sensitivity analysis allows us to inject less noise to obtain (ϵ, δ)-differential privacy with added regret caused by noise injection in . We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis over the amount of noise added via dynamic global sensitivity and the corresponding upper regret bound of our proposed algorithm. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets confirmed the algorithm’s advantage against existing solutions.</p>

    <h3>Learning Users’ Preferred Visual Styles in an Image Marketplace (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandra Sala, Raul Gomez Bruballa, Lauren Burnham-King</p>
    <p>Providing meaningful recommendations in a content marketplace is challenging due to the fact that users are not the final content consumers. Instead, most users are creatives whose interests, linked to the projects they work on, change rapidly and abruptly. To address the challenging task of recommending images to content creators, we design a RecSys that learns visual styles preferences transversal to the semantics of the projects users work on. We analyze the challenges of the task compared to content-based recommendations driven by semantics, propose an evaluation setup, and explain its applications in a global image marketplace.</p>

    <h3>TAFA: Two-headed Attention Fused Autoencoder for Context-Aware Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin Peng Zhou, Felipe Perez, Maksims Volkovs, Zhaoyue Cheng</p>
    <p>Collaborative filtering with implicit feedback is a ubiquitous class of recommendation problems where only positive interactions such as purchases or clicks are observed. Autoencoder-based recommendation models have shown strong performance on many implicit feedback benchmarks. However, these models tend to suffer from popularity bias making recommendations less personalized. User-generated reviews contain a rich source of preference information, often with specific details that are important to each user, and can help mitigate the popularity bias. Since not all reviews are equally useful, existing work has been exploring various forms of attention to distill relevant information. In the majority of proposed approaches, representations from implicit feedback and review branches are simply concatenated at the end to generate predictions. This can prevent the model from learning deeper correlations between the two modalities and affect prediction accuracy. To address these problems, we propose a novel Two-headed Attention Fused Autoencoder (TAFA) model that jointly learns representations from user reviews and implicit feedback to make recommendations. We apply early and late modality fusion which allows the model to fully correlate and extract relevant information from both input sources. To further combat popularity bias, we leverage the Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) objective to “de-popularize” the fused user representation via a two-headed decoder architecture. Empirically, we show that TAFA outperforms leading baselines on multiple real-world benchmarks. Moreover, by tracing attention weights back to reviews we can provide explanations for the generated recommendations and gain further insights into user preferences.

    <h3>Query as Context for Item-to-Item Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moumita Bhattacharya</p>
    <p>Recommender Systems is one of the main machine learning applications for an e-commerce platforms such as Etsy, a two sided marketplace. A frequent usage of such system is for item-to-item recommendations that show similar items (also referred as listings) based on the listing a user is currently viewing. Item-to-item recommendations typically take into account information that are only associated with the target listing and other listings in the inventory. However, other contextual information such as user intents, queries and seasonality, are often not taken into account. In this talk, we will present two approaches we developed to utilize additional contextual information in the form of queries in generating item-to-item recommendations. Moreover, we will present our journey in migrating Etsy’s rankers from linear to non-linear models. Additionally, we propose new metrics to evaluate candidate sets that accesses diversity and price spread, while not compromising relevance. The proposed metrics can also be used beyond the current application. Our proposed candidate set generation approach outperforms the model in production as well as yielding significant lift in conversion rate and other engagement metrics as indicated by several A/B tests.</p>

    <h3>Data Mining for Item Recommendation in MOBA Games (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Parra, Felipe Rios, Vladimir Araujo</p>
    <p>E-Sports has been positioned as an important activity within  MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) games in recent years. There is existing research on recommender systems in this topic, but most of it focuses on the character recommendation problem. However, the recommendation of items is also challenging because of its contextual nature, depending on the other characters. We have developed a framework that suggests items for a character based on the match context. The system aims to help players who have recently started the game as well as frequent players to take strategic advantage during a match and to improve their purchasing decision making. By analyzing a dataset of ranked matches through data mining techniques, we can capture purchase dynamic of experienced players to use it to generate recommendations. The results show that our proposed solution yields up to 80% of mAP, suggesting that the method leverages context information successfully. These results, together with open issues we mention in the paper, call for further research in the area. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Adversarial Tensor Factorization for Context-aware Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huiyuan Chen, Jing Li</p>
    <p>Contextual factors such as time, location, or tag, can affect user preferences for a particular item. Context-aware recommendations are thus critical to improve both quality and explainability of recommender systems, compared to traditional recommendations solely based on user-item interactions. Tensor factorization machines have achieved state-of-the-art performance  due to their generic integration of users, items, and contextual factors in one unify way. However,  few work has focused on the robustness of a context-aware recommender system. Improving the robustness of a tensor-based model is challenging due to the sparsity of the observed tensor and the multi-linear nature of tensor factorization. In this paper, we propose ATF, a model that combines tensor factorization and adversarial learning for context-aware recommendations. Doing so allows us to reap the benefits of tensor factorization, while enhancing the robustness of a recommender model, and thus improves its performance. Empirical studies on two real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms standard tensor-based  methods. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Collective Embedding for Neural Context-Aware Recommender Systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Dolog, Felipe Soares da Costa</p>
    <p>Context-aware recommender systems consider contextual features as additional information to predict user’s preferences. For example, the recommendations could be based on time, location, or the company of other people. Among the contextual information, time became an important feature because user preferences tend to change over time or be similar in the near future. Researchers have proposed different models to incorporate time into their recommender system, however, the current models are not able to capture specific temporal patterns. To address the limitation observed in previous works, we propose Collective embedding for Neural Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CoNCARS). The proposed solution jointly model the item, user and time embeddings to capture temporal patterns. Then, CoNCARS use the outer product to model the user-item-time correlations between dimensions of the embedding space. The hidden features feed our Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn the non-linearities between the different features. Finally, we combine the output from our CNNs in the fusion layer and then predict the user’s preference score. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating CoNCARS improves the top-N item recommendation task and outperform the state-of-the-art recommendation methods.</p>

    <h3>ComfRide: A Smartphone based System for Comfortable Public Transport Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surjya Ghosh, Niloy Ganguly, Sandip Chakraborty, Bivas Mitra, Rohit Verma, Saketh Mahankali</p>
    <p>Passenger comfort is a major factor influencing a commuter’s decision to avail public transport. Existing studies suggest that factors like overcrowding, jerkiness, traffic congestion etc. correlate well to passenger’s (dis)comfort. An online survey conducted with more than 300 participants from 12 different countries reveals that different personalized and context dependent factors influence passenger comfort during a travel by public transport. Leveraging on these findings, we identify correlations between comfort level and these dynamic parameters, and implement a smartphone based application, ComfRide, which recommends the most comfortable route based on user’s preference honoring her travel time constraint. We use a ‘Dynamic Input/Output Automata’ based composition model to capture both the wide varieties of comfort choices from the commuters and the impact of environment on the comfort parameters. Evaluation of ComfRide, involving 50 participants over 28 routes in a state capital of India, reveals that recommended routes have on average 30% better comfort level than Google map recommended routes, when a commuter gives priority to specific comfort parameters of her choice.</p>

    <h3>The Importance of Song Context in Music Playlists (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Massimo Quadrana, Andreu Vall, Gerhard Widmer, Markus Schedl, Paolo Cremonesi</p>
    <p>Music recommender systems often operate in sequential mode by suggesting a collection of songs that constitute a listening session. This task is usually called automated music playlist generation and it has been previously studied in the literature with different successful approaches based on, e.g., variations of collaborative filtering or content-based similarity. Some of the proposed playlist models take into consideration the current song and a number of previous songs, i.e., the song context , in order to predict the next song. However, it is not yet clear to what extent knowing this song context improves next-song predictions. To shed light on this question, we conduct a numerical experiment on two datasets of hand-curated music playlists, where we compare playlist models that account for different song context lengths. Our results indicate that knowing the song context seems, at first, uninformative. However, we explain this effect by a strong bias in the data towards very popular songs and observe that, in fact, songs in the long tail are more accurately predicted when the song context is considered.</p>

    <h3>Discovering What You’re Known For: A Contextual Poisson Factorization Approach (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haokai Lu, James Caverlee, Wei Niu</p>
    <p>Discovering what people are known for is valuable to many important applications such as recommender systems. Unlike an individual’s personal interests, what a user is known for is reflected by the views of others, and is often not easily discerned for a long-tail of the vast majority of users. In this paper, we tackle the problem of discovering what users are known for through a probabilistic model called Bayesian Contextual Poisson Factorization. Moving beyond just modeling user’s content, it naturally models and integrates additional contextual factors, concretely, user’s geo-spatial footprints and social influence, to overcome noisy online activities and social relations. Through GPS-tagged social media datasets, we find that the proposed method can improve known-for prediction performance by 17.5% in precision and 20.9% in recall on average, and that it can capture the implicit relationships between a user’s known-for profile and her content, geo-spatial and social influence.</p>

To handle the sparsity problem, several recommendation techniques have been proposed that additionally consider auxiliary information to improve rating prediction accuracy. In particular, when rating data is sparse, document modeling-based approaches have improved the accuracy by additionally utilizing textual data such as reviews, abstracts, or synopses. However, due to the inherent limitation of the bag-of-words model, they have difficulties in effectively utilizing contextual information of the documents, which leads to shallow understanding of the documents. This paper proposes a novel context-aware recommendation model, convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF) that integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) into probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF). Consequently, ConvMF captures contextual information of documents and further enhances the rating prediction accuracy. Our extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets show that ConvMF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation models even when the rating data is extremely sparse. We also demonstrate that ConvMF successfully captures subtle contextual difference of a word in a document. Our implementation and datasets are available at http://dm.postech.ac.kr/ConvMF.</p>
