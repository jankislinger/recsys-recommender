    <h3>A New Perspective in Health Recommendations: Integration of Human Pose Estimation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaetano Dibenedetto</p>
    <p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in multimodal and multi-source data due to their ability to introduce heterogeneous information. Studies have demonstrated that combining such information enhances the performance of Recommender Systems across various scenarios. In the context of Health Recommendation Systems (HRS), different types of data are utilized, primarily focusing on patient-based information, but data from Pose Estimations (PE) are not incorporated. The objective of my Ph.D. is to investigate methods to design and develop HRS that treat the PE as one of the input sources, taking into account aspects such as privacy concerns and balancing the trade-off between system quality and responsiveness. By leveraging the combination of diverse information sources, I intend to create a new model in the area of HRS capable of providing more precise and explainable recommendations.</p>

    <h3>FineNet: A Joint Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Network Model to Forecast and Recommend Anomalous Financial Items (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Che Tsai, You-Jia Chen, Chih-Yao Chen, Cheng-Te Li, Pei-Chi Wang, Shao-Lun Ma, Yu-Chieh Chang</p>
    <p>Financial technology (FinTech) draws much attention in these years, with the advances of machine learning and deep learning. In this work, given historical time series of stock prices of companies, we aim at forecasting upcoming anomalous financial items, i.e., abrupt soaring or diving stocks, in financial time series, and recommending the corresponding stocks to support financial operations. We propose a novel joint convolutional and recurrent neural network model, Financial Event Neural Network (FineNet), to forecast and recommend anomalous stocks. Experiments conducted on the time series of stock prices of 300 well-known companies exhibit the promising performance of FineNet in terms of precision and recall. We build FineNet as a Web platform for live demonstration.</p>

    <h3>Greedy Optimized Multileaving for Personalization (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kojiro Iizuka, Yoshifumi Seki, Takeshi Yoneda</p>
    <p>Personalization plays an important role in many services. To evaluate personalized rankings, online evaluation, such as A/B testing, is widely used today. Recently, multileaving has been found to be an efficient method for evaluating rankings in information retrieval fields. This paper describes the first attempt to optimize the multileaving method for personalization settings. We clarify the challenges of applying this method to personalized rankings. Then, to solve these challenges, we propose greedy optimized multileaving (GOM) with a new credit feedback function. The empirical results showed that GOM was stable for increasing ranking lengths and the number of rankers. We implemented GOM on our actual news recommender systems, and compared its online performance. The results showed that GOM evaluated the personalized rankings precisely, with significantly smaller sample sizes (< 1/10) than A/B testing. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Random Walk with Wait and Restart on Document Co-citation Network for Similar Document Search (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masaki Eto</p>
    <p>One of the latest algorithms for computing similarities between nodes in a graph is Random Walk with Restart (RWR). However, on a document co-citation network for similar document search, computing transition probabilities remains difficult. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a Random Walk with Wait and Restart (RWWR) algorithm, which contains a new technique for adjusting the transition probability by incorporating a “selfreturning” edge into the normalization. To evaluate its effectiveness empirically, the search performance of two retrieval methods using RWWR was compared to a method using the standard RWR; the performance was measured by average precision and nDCG. The experiment was conducted on a test collection created from the Open Access Subset of PubMed Central, and the results indicated that the RWWR methods tend to outperform the standard RWR method.</p>
