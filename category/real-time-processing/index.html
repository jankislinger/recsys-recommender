    <h3>LARR: Large Language Model Aided Real-time Scene Recommendation with Semantic Understanding (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhizhong Wan, Fei Jiang, Wei Lin, Bin Yin, Junjie Xie, Xiang Li</p>
    <p>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is crucial for Recommendation System(RS), aiming to provide personalized recommendation services for users in many aspects such as food delivery, e-commerce and so on. However, traditional RS relies on collaborative signals, which lacks semantic understanding to real-time scenes. We also noticed that a major challenge in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for practical recommendation purposes is their efficiency in dealing with long text input. To break through the problems above, we propose Large Language Model Aided Real-time Scene Recommendation(LARR), adopt LLMs for semantic understanding, utilizing real-time scene information in RS without requiring LLM to process the entire real-time scene text directly, thereby enhancing the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling. Specifically, recommendation domain-specific knowledge is injected into LLM and then RS employs an aggregation encoder to build real-time scene information from separate LLM’s outputs. Firstly, a LLM is continue-pretrained on corpus built from recommendation data with the aid of special tokens. Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via contrastive learning on three kinds of sample construction strategies. Through this step, LLM is transformed into a text embedding model. Finally, LLM’s separate outputs for different scene features are aggregated by an encoder, aligning to collaborative signals in RS, enhancing the performance of recommendation model.</p>

    <h3>Using Learnable Physics for Real-Time Exercise Form Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gautam Chauhan, Abhishek Jaiswal, Nisheeth Srivastava</p>
    <p>Good posture and form are essential for safe and productive exercising. Even in gym settings, trainers may not be readily available for feedback. Rehabilitation therapies and fitness workouts can thus benefit from recommender systems that provide real-time evaluation. In this paper, we present an algorithmic pipeline that can diagnose problems in exercises technique and offer corrective recommendations, with high sensitivity and specificity, in real-time. We use MediaPipe for pose recognition, count repetitions using peak-prominence detection, and use a learnable physics simulator to track motion evolution for each exercise. A test video is diagnosed based on deviations from the prototypical learned motion using statistical learning. The system is evaluated on six full and upper body exercises. These real-time interactive suggestions counseled via low-cost equipment like smartphones will allow exercisers to rectify potential mistakes making self-practice feasible while reducing the risk of workout injuries.</p>

    <h3>Recommendations: They’re in fashion (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiago Lacerda, Diogo Gonçalves, Carlos Carvalheira</p>
    <p>Farfetch, the leading online platform for luxury fashion, has spent several years developing a recommender system. In fact, recommendations have been quite successful in improving both the user experience and the company’s own business metrics [3 – 9]. In this talk we will shed some light on how we built our recommender system at Farfetch, the main obstacles we faced, and some plans for the future. Recommendations started their journey at Farfetch somewhere around 2015. At the time, we had a single model that trained once per day that updated the users’ recommendations with the same frequency. Currently, we have around 20 models in production and the majority of them are designed to handle streaming data from the users and adapt in realtime to user actions. How can we balance training and improving existing models, creating new models, serving them in real time and still keep our code in check, our tests up to date and our pipelines moving? We will discuss the three main components that we created in order to tackle our real world issue of providing ever-improving recommendations to our customers: The Gym, The Recommenders and The API. The Gym (Fig. 1) is the place where model training takes place. Inspired by the gyms from Open-AI and Criteo [ 1, 2], it mixes Spark and Python according to what we need to process. It has three main goals. Process the data that is going to feed the models, train the models, and evaluate the models. The Gym is equipped to handle every model from deep neural networks to simple collaborative models. It provides a fluid platform for multi model creation. The Recommenders (Fig. 2) define the common structure and interface for each recommender model. From applying the literature and our own experience, we found a predetermined behaviour that every recommendation follows, even though the models can be quite different from one another. It’s the individual components of a specific recommender that change. The components determine which products or brands are the candidates for a recommendation, what the right context for the recommendation is and how to score the candidates in light of the context. We can then mix and match these components to achieve the right recommender model. The Recommenders define these components and the common path that uses them. It’s Strategy Pattern all the way down. The API (Fig. 3), which we call Precog, loads and serves the models previously trained in The Gym and defined in The Recommenders. Every request made to this application triggers an execution for the particular context of the request, which means we can deliver highly personalized and context-aware recommendations. Since every recommender model is defined as implementing a recommend method, the API is simultaneously flexible in the variety of models it handles, but also quite unconcerned with the specific implementation of a recommender model and the libraries/packages needed to train it. Finally, with this presentation, we aim to give an overview and understanding of our recommendations cycle, going in detail about how these three components communicate among them. The final goal is to give a personalised experience to our customers, which given the luxury ecosystem in which Farfetch is involved, has high demands and expectations associated with it.</p>

    <h3>A GPU-specialized Inference Parameter Server for Large-Scale Deep Recommendation Models (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingcan Wei, Fan Yu, Jie Liu, Ji Shi, Matthias Langer, Minseok Lee, Zehuan Wang</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems are of crucial importance for a variety of modern apps and web services, such as news feeds, social networks, e-commerce, search, etc. To achieve peak prediction accuracy, modern recommendation models combine deep learning with terabyte-scale embedding tables to obtain a fine-grained representation of the underlying data. Traditional inference serving architectures require deploying the whole model to standalone servers, which is infeasible at such massive scale.<br>In this paper, we provide insights into the intriguing and challenging inference domain of online recommendation systems. We propose the HugeCTR Hierarchical Parameter Server (HPS), an industry-leading distributed recommendation inference framework, that combines a high-performance GPU embedding cache with an hierarchical storage architecture, to realize low-latency retrieval of embeddings for online model inference tasks. Among other things, HPS features (1) a redundant hierarchical storage system, (2) a novel high-bandwidth cache to accelerate parallel embedding lookup on NVIDIA GPUs, (3) online training support and (4) light-weight APIs for easy integration into existing large-scale recommendation workflows. To demonstrate its capabilities, we conduct extensive studies using both synthetically engineered and public datasets. We show that our HPS can dramatically reduce end-to-end inference latency, achieving 5~62x speedup (depending on the batch size) over CPU baseline implementations for popular recommendation models. Through multi-GPU concurrent deployment, the HPS can also greatly increase the inference QPS.</p>

    <h3>StreamingRec: A Framework for Benchmarking Stream-based News Recommenders (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Michael Jugovac, Mozhgan Karimi</p>
    <p>News is one of the earliest application domains of recommender systems, and recommending items from a virtually endless stream of news is still a relevant problem today. News recommendation is different from other application domains in a variety of ways, e.g., because new items constantly become available for recommendation. To be effective, news recommenders therefore have to continuously consider the latest items in the incoming stream of news in their recommendation models. However, today’s public software libraries for algorithm benchmarking mostly do not consider these particularities of the domain. As a result, authors often rely on proprietary protocols, which hampers the comparability of the obtained results. In this paper, we present StreamingRec as a framework for evaluating streaming-based news recommenders in a replicable way. The open-source framework implements a replay-based evaluation protocol that allows algorithms to update the underlying models in real-time when new events are recorded and new articles are available for recommendation. Furthermore, a variety of baseline algorithms for session-based recommendation are part of StreamingRec. For these, we also report a number of performance results for two datasets, which confirm the importance of immediate model updates.</p>

    <h3>Idomaar: A Framework for Multi-dimensional Benchmarking of Recommender Algorithms (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andras Sereny, Davide Malagoli, Till Plumbaum, Andreas Lommatzsch, Benjamin Kille, Martha Larson, Frank Hopfgartner, Mario Scriminaci</p>
    <p>In real-world scenarios, recommenders face non-functional requirements of technical nature and must handle dynamic data in the form of sequential streams. Evaluation of recommender systems must take these issues into account in order to be maximally informative. In this paper, we present a framework called Idomaar which enables the efficient multi-dimensional benchmarking of recommender algorithms. Idomaar goes beyond current academic research practices by creating a realistic evaluation environment and computing both effectiveness and technical metrics for stream-based as well as set based evaluation. The potentials of the framework are illustrated in a scenario that focuses on the “research to prototyping to productization” cycle at a company. We show that Idomaar simplifies the testing with different configurations and supports the flexible integration of different data.</p>

    <h3>Powering Content Discovery through Scalable, Realtime Profiling of Users’ Content Preferences (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roy Bass, Baruch Brutman, Yoram Dayagi, Ido Tamir, Guy Kobrinsky, Ronny Lempel</p>
    <p>Outbrain is the Web’s leading content discovery service, recommending billions of stories daily to a global audience across many of the world’s most prestigious and respected publishers. Outbrain’s recommendation technology combines contextual cues with personalization, where the personalization aspects are a combination of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. This paper, and the accompanying demo of a production system, offer a behind-the-scenes view of the content-based aspects of Outbrain’s personalization technology. We detail the types of features we extract from content, as well as the attributes we keep in each user’s content-affinity profile. We then describe and demonstrate how we update each user’s profile, in real time, as the user consumes content while browsing the Web.</p>
