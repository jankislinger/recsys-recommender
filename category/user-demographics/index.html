    <h3>Analyzing Item Popularity Bias of Music Recommender Systems: Are Different Genders Equally Affected? (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Navid Rekabsaz, Elisabeth Lex, Dominik Kowald, Stefan Brandl, Markus Schedl, Alessandro Melchiorre, Oleg Lesota</p>
    <p>Several studies have identified discrepancies between the popularity of items in user profiles and the corresponding recommendation lists. Such behavior, which concerns a variety of recommendation algorithms, is referred to as popularity bias. Existing work predominantly adopts simple statistical measures, such as the difference of mean or median popularity, to quantify popularity bias. Moreover, it does so irrespective of user characteristics other than the inclination to popular content. In this work, in contrast, we propose to investigate popularity differences (between the user profile and recommendation list) in terms of median, a variety of statistical moments, as well as similarity measures that consider the entire popularity distributions (Kullback-Leibler divergence and Kendall’s τ rank-order correlation). This results in a more detailed picture of the characteristics of popularity bias. Furthermore, we investigate whether such algorithmic popularity bias affects users of different genders in the same way. We focus on music recommendation and conduct experiments on the recently released standardized LFM-2b dataset, containing listening profiles of Last.fm users. We investigate the algorithmic popularity bias of seven common recommendation algorithms (five collaborative filtering and two baselines). Our experiments show that (1) the studied metrics provide novel insights into popularity bias in comparison with only using average differences, (2) algorithms less inclined towards popularity bias amplification do not necessarily perform worse in terms of utility (NDCG), (3) the majority of the investigated recommenders intensify the popularity bias of the female users.</p>

    <h3>Personality Bias of Music Recommendation Algorithms (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Melchiorre, Eva Zangerle, Markus Schedl</p>
    <p><br>Recommender systems, like other tools that make use of machine learning, are known to create or increase certain biases. Earlier work has already unveiled different performance of recommender systems for different user groups, depending on gender, age, country, and consumption behavior. In this work, we study user bias in terms of another aspect, i.e., users’ personality. We investigate to which extent state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms yield different accuracy scores depending on the users’ personality traits. We focus on the music domain and create a dataset of Twitter users’ music consumption behavior and personality traits, measuring the latter in terms of the OCEAN model. Investigating recall@K and NDCG@K of the recommendation algorithms SLIM, embarrassingly shallow autoencoders for sparse data (EASE), and variational autoencoders for collaborative filtering (Mult-VAE) on this dataset, we find several significant differences in performance between user groups scoring high vs. groups scoring low on several personality traits.<br></p>

    <h3>The Demographics of Cool: Popularity and Recommender Performance for Different Groups of Users (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael D. Ekstrand, Maria Soledad Pera</p>
    <p>Typical recommender evaluations treat users as a homogeneous unit. However, user subgroups often differ in their tastes, which can result more broadly in diverse recommender needs. Thus, these groups may have different degrees of satisfaction with the provided recommendations. We explore the offline top- N performance of collaborative filtering algorithms across two domains. We find that several strategies achieve higher accuracy for dominant demographic groups, thus increasing the overall performance for the strategy, without providing increased benefits for other users.</p>

    <h3>Recommending with an Agenda: Active Learning of Private Attributes using Matrix Factorization (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Smriti Bhagat, Nina Taft, Udi Weinsberg, Stratis Ioannidis</p>
    <p>Recommender systems leverage user demographic information, such as age, gender, etc., to personalize recommendations and better place their targeted ads. Oftentimes, users do not volunteer this information due to privacy concerns, or due to a lack of initiative in filling out their online profiles. We illustrate a new threat in which a recommender learns private attributes of users who do not voluntarily disclose them. We design both passive and active attacks that so- licit ratings for strategically selected items, and could thus be used by a recommender system to pursue this hidden agenda. Our methods are based on a novel usage of Bayesian matrix factorization in an active learning setting. Evaluations on multiple datasets illustrate that such attacks are indeed feasible and use significantly fewer rated items than static inference methods. Importantly, they succeed without sacrificing the quality of recommendations to users.</p>

    <h3>Social Collaborative Filtering for Cold-start Recommendations (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jordan Christensen, Scott Sanner, Lexing Xie, Darius Braziunas, Suvash Sedhain</p>
    <p>We examine the cold-start recommendation task in an online retail setting for users who have not yet purchased (or interacted in a meaningful way with) any available items but who have granted access to limited side information, such as basic demographic data (gender, age, location) or social network information (Facebook friends or page likes). We formalize neighborhood-based methods for cold-start collaborative filtering in a generalized matrix algebra framework that does not require purchase data for target users when their side information is available. In real-data experiments with 30,000 users who purchased 80,000+ books and had 9,000,000+ Facebook friends and 6,000,000+ page likes, we show that using Facebook page likes for cold-start recommendation yields up to a 3-fold improvement in mean average precision (mAP) and up to 6-fold improvements in Precision@k and Recall@k compared to most-popular-item, demographic, and Facebook friend cold-start recommenders. These results demonstrate the substantial predictive power of social network content, and its significant utility in a challenging problem – recommendation for cold-start users.</p>
