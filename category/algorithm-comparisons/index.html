    <h3>Large Language Models are Competitive Near Cold-start Recommenders for Language- and Item-based Preferences (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Dixon, Krisztian Balog, Filip Radlinski, Scott Sanner, Ben Wedin</p>
    <p>Traditional recommender systems leverage users’ item preference history to recommend novel content that users may like.  However, dialog interfaces that allow users to express language-based preferences offer a fundamentally different modality for preference input.  Inspired by recent successes of prompting paradigms for large language models (LLMs), we study their use for making recommendations from both item-based and language-based preferences in comparison to state-of-the-art item-based collaborative filtering (CF) methods.  To support this investigation, we collect a new dataset consisting of both item-based and language-based preferences elicited from users along with their ratings on a variety of (biased) recommended items and (unbiased) random items.  Among numerous experimental results, we find that LLMs provide competitive recommendation performance for pure language-based preferences (no item preferences) in the near cold-start case in comparison to item-based CF methods, despite having no supervised training for this specific task (zero-shot) or only a few labels (few-shot).  This is particularly promising as language-based preference representations are more explainable and scrutable than item-based or vector-based representations.</p>

    <h3>Comparative Recommender System Evaluation: Benchmarking Recommendation Frameworks (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Said, Alejandro Bellogin</p>
    <p>Recommender systems research is often based on comparisons of predictive accuracy: the better the evaluation scores, the better the recommender. However, it is difficult to compare results from different recommender systems due to the many options in design and implementation of an evaluation strategy. Additionally, algorithm implementations can diverge from the standard formulation due to manual tuning and modifications that work better in some situations. In this work we compare common recommendation algorithms as implemented in three popular recommendation frameworks. To provide a fair comparison, we have complete control of the evaluation dimensions being benchmarked: dataset, data splitting, evaluation strategies, and metrics. We also include results using the internal evaluation mechanisms of these frameworks. Our analysis points to large differences in recommendation accuracy across frameworks and strategies, i.e. the same baselines may perform orders of magnitude better or worse across frameworks. Our results show the necessity of clear guidelines when reporting evaluation of recommender systems to ensure reproducibility and comparison of results.</p>
