    <h3>Discerning Canonical User Representation for Cross-Domain Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sherry Sahebi, Siqian Zhao</p>
    <p>Cross-domain recommender systems have emerged, to address the cold-start problem and enhance recommendation outcomes by leveraging information transfer across different domains. Existing cross-domain recommender systems have investigated the learning of both domain-specific and domain-shared user preferences to enhance recommendation performance. However, these models typically allow the disparities between shared and distinct user preferences to emerge freely in any space, lacking sufficient constraints to identify differences between two domains and ensure that both domains are considered simultaneously. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) has shown promise for transferring information between domains, by mapping their user representations into the same space. But, CCA only models domain similarities, and fails to capture the potential differences between user preferences in different domains. In this paper, we propose Discerning Canonical User Representation Learning for Cross-Domain Recommendation (DICUCDR), a generative adversarial networks (GAN) based method that learns both domain-shared and domain-specific user representations. DICUCDR introduces Discerning Canonical Correlation User Representation Learning (DCCRL), a novel design of non-linear Canonical Correlation mappings that creates a shared transformation for simultaneously mapping similarities between different domains and separating domain differences from domains. We compare DICUCDR against several state-of-the-art approaches using two real-world datasets. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of separately learning shared and specific user representations via DCCRL.</p>

    <h3>MLoRA: Multi-Domain Low-Rank Adaptive Network for CTR Prediction (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Libin Yang, Haining Gao, Wei Ning, Luwei Yang, Zhiming Yang, Dehong Gao, Guannan Zhang, Xiaoyan Cai</p>
    <p>Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is one of the fundamental tasks in the industry, especially in e-commerce, social media, and streaming media. It directly impacts website revenues, user satisfaction, and user retention. However, real-world production platforms often encompass various domains to cater for diverse customer needs. Traditional CTR prediction models struggle in multi-domain recommendation scenarios, facing challenges of data sparsity and disparate data distributions across domains. Existing multi-domain recommendation approaches introduce specific-domain modules for each domain, which partially address these issues but often significantly increase model parameters and lead to insufficient training. In this paper, we propose a Multi-domain Low-Rank Adaptive network (MLoRA) for CTR prediction, where we introduce a specialized LoRA module for each domain. This approach enhances the model’s performance in multi-domain CTR prediction tasks and is able to be applied to various deep-learning models. We evaluate the proposed method on several multi-domain datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our MLoRA approach achieves a significant improvement compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we deploy it in a real-world e-commerce production website. The online A/B testing results indicate the superiority and flexibility in real-world production environments.</p>

    <h3>Joint User Modeling across Aligned Heterogeneous Sites (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuezhi Cao, Yong Yu</p>
    <p>An accurate and comprehensive user modeling technique is crucial for the quality of recommender systems. Traditionally, we model user preferences using only actions from the target site and may suffer from cold-start problem. As nowadays people normally engage in multiple online sites for various needs, we consider leveraging the cross-site actions to improve the user modeling accuracy. Specifically, in this paper we aim at achieving a more comprehensive and accurate user modeling by modeling user’s actions in multiple aligned heterogeneous sites simultaneously. To do so, we propose a modularized probabilistic graphical model framework JUMA. We further integrate topic model and matrix factorization into JUMA for joint user modeling over text-based and item-based sites. We assemble and publish large-scale dataset for comprehensive analyzing and evaluation. Experimental results show that our framework JUMA out performs traditional within-site user modeling techniques, especially for cold-start scenarios. For cold-start users, we achieve relative improvements of 9.3% and 12.8% comparing to existing within-site approaches for recommendation in item-based and text-based sites respectively. Thus we draw the conclusion that aligning heterogeneous sites and modeling users jointly do help to improve the quality of online recommender systems.</p>
