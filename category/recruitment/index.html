    <h3>An Exploration of Sentence-Pair Classification for Algorithmic Recruiting (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toine Bogers, Mesut Kaya</p>
    <p>Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the application of computational approaches to different HR tasks, such as algorithmic hiring, skill extraction, and monitoring of employee satisfaction. Much of the recent work on estimating the fit between a person and a job has used representation learning to represent both resumes and job vacancies computationally and determine the degree to which they match. A common approach to this task is Sentence-BERT, which uses a Siamese network to encode resumes and job descriptions into fixed-length vectors and estimates how well they match based on the similarity between those vectors. In our paper, we adapt BERT’s next-sentence prediction task—predicting whether one sentence is likely to follow another in a given context—to the task of matching resumes with job descriptions. Using historical data on past (mis)matches between job-resume pairs, we fine-tune BERT for this downstream task. Through a combination of offline and online experiments on data from a large Scandinavian job portal, we show that this approach performs significantly better than Sentence-BERT and other state-of-the-art approaches for determining person-job fit.</p>

    <h3>Reciprocal Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Zheng, Hengshu Zhu, Yang Song, Wayne Xin Zhao, Yupeng Hou</p>
    <p>Reciprocal recommender system (RRS), considering a two-way matching between two parties, has been widely applied in online platforms like online dating and recruitment. Existing RRS models mainly capture static user preferences, which have neglected the evolving user tastes and the dynamic matching relation between the two parties. Although dynamic user modeling has been well-studied in sequential recommender systems, existing solutions are developed in a user-oriented manner. Therefore, it is non-trivial to adapt sequential recommendation algorithms to reciprocal recommendation. In this paper, we formulate RRS as a distinctive sequence matching task, and further propose a new approach ReSeq for RRS, which is short for Reciprocal Sequential recommendation. To capture duel-perspective matching, we propose to learn fine-grained sequence similarities by co-attention mechanism across different time steps. Further, to improve the inference efficiency, we introduce the self-distillation technique to distill knowledge from the fine-grained matching module into the more efficient student module. In the deployment stage, only the efficient student module is used, greatly speeding up the similarity computation. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets from two scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReSeq/.</p>

    <h3>Modeling Two-Way Selection Preference for Person-Job Fit (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yupeng Hou, Wayne Xin Zhao, Chen Yang, Yang Song, Tao Zhang, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
    <p>Person-job fit is the core technique of online recruitment platforms, which can improve the efficiency of recruitment by accurately matching the job positions with the job seekers. Existing works mainly focus on modeling the unidirectional process or overall matching. However, recruitment is a two-way selection process, which means that both candidate and employer involved in the interaction should meet the expectation of each other, instead of unilateral satisfaction. In this paper, we propose a dual-perspective graph representation learning approach to model directed interactions between candidates and jobs. To model the two-way selection preference from the dual-perspective of job seekers and employers, we incorporate two different nodes for each candidate (or job) and characterize both successful matching and failed matching via a unified dual-perspective interaction graph. To learn dual-perspective node representations effectively, we design an effective optimization algorithm, which involves a quadruple-based loss and a dual-perspective contrastive learning loss. Extensive experiments on three large real-world recruitment datasets have shown the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/DPGNN .</p>
