    <h3>Playlist Search Reinvented: LLMs Behind the Curtain (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tarun Sharma, Siddharth Sharma, Geetha Aluri, Joaquin Delgado</p>
    <p>Improving search functionality poses challenges such as data scarcity for model training, metadata enrichment for comprehensive document indexing, and the labor-intensive manual annotation for evaluation. Traditionally, iterative methods relying on human annotators and customer feedback have been used. However, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new solutions. This paper focuses on applying LLMs to playlist search in Amazon Music. Leveraging LLMsâ€™ contextual understanding and generative capabilities automates metadata enrichment, reducing manual efforts and expediting training. LLMs also address data scarcity by generating synthetic training data and serve as scalable judges for evaluation, enhancing search performance assessment. We demonstrate how these innovations enhance playlist search, overcoming traditional limitations to improve search result accuracy and relevance.</p>

    <h3>Identifying New Podcasts with High General Appeal Using a Pure Exploration Infinitely-Armed Bandit Strategy (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugues Bouchard, Javed Aslam, Kevin Jamieson, Maryam Aziz, Alice Y. Wang, Jesse Anderton</p>
    <p>Podcasting is an increasingly popular medium for entertainment and discourse around the world, with tens of thousands of new podcasts released on a monthly basis. We consider the problem of identifying from these newly-released podcasts those with the largest potential audiences so they can be considered for personalized recommendation to users. We first study and then discard a supervised approach due to the inadequacy of either content or consumption features for this task, and instead propose a novel non-contextual bandit algorithm in the fixed-budget infinitely-armed pure-exploration setting. We demonstrate that our algorithm is well-suited to the best-arm identification task for a broad class of arm reservoir distributions, out-competing a large number of state-of-the-art algorithms. We then apply the algorithm to identifying podcasts with broad appeal in a simulated study, and show that it efficiently sorts podcasts into groups by increasing appeal while avoiding the popularity bias inherent in supervised approaches.</p>

    <h3>Automatic Collection Creation and Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manjeet Dahiya, Piyush Singh, Sanidhya Singal</p>
    <p>We present a collection recommender system that can automatically create and recommend collections of items at a user level. Unlike regular recommender systems, which output top-N relevant items, a collection recommender system outputs collections of items such that the items in the collections are relevant to a user, and the items within a collection follow a specific theme. Our system builds on top of the user-item representations learnt by item recommender systems. We employ dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques along with intuitive heuristics to create collections with their ratings and titles. We test these ideas in a real-world setting of music recommendation, within a popular music streaming service. We find that there is a 2.3x increase in recommendation-driven consumption when recommending collections over items. Further, it results in effective utilization of real estate and leads to recommending a more and diverse set of items. To our knowledge, these are first of its kind experiments at such a large scale.</p>

    <h3>Coverage, Redundancy and Size-Awareness in Genre Diversity for Recommender Systems (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saul Vargas, Pablo Castells, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Linas Baltrunas</p>
    <p>There is increasing awareness in the Recommender Systems field that diversity is as a key property that enhances the usefulness of recommendations. Genre information can serve as a means to measure and enhance the diversity of recommendations and is readily available in domains such as movies, music or books. In this work we propose a new Binomial framework for defining genre diversity in recommender systems that takes into account three key properties: genre coverage, genre redundancy and recommendation list size-awareness. We show that methods previously proposed for measuring and enhancing recommendation diversity -including those adapted from search result diversification- fail to address adequately these three properties. We also propose an efficient greedy optimization technique to optimize Binomial diversity. Experiments with the Netflix dataset show the properties of our framework and comparison with state of the art methods.</p>
