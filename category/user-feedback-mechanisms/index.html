    <h3>Multi-Step Critiquing User Interface for Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diana Andreea Petrescu, Diego Antognini, Boi Faltings</p>
    <p>Recommendations with personalized explanations have been shown to increase user trust and perceived quality and help users make better decisions. Moreover, such explanations allow users to provide feedback by critiquing them. Several algorithms for recommender systems with multi-step critiquing have therefore been developed. However, providing a user-friendly interface based on personalized explanations and critiquing has not been addressed in the last decade. In this paper, we introduce four different web interfaces (available under https://lia.epfl.ch/critiquing/) helping users making decisions and finding their ideal item. We have chosen the hotel recommendation domain as a use case even though our approach is trivially adaptable for other domains. Moreover, our system is model-agnostic (for both recommender systems and critiquing models) allowing a great flexibility and further extensions. Our interfaces are above all a useful tool to help research in recommendation with critiquing. They allow to test such systems on a real use case and also to highlight some limitations of these approaches to find solutions to overcome them.</p>

    <h3>A Ranking Optimization Approach to Latent Linear Critiquing in Conversational Recommender System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Scott Sanner, Kai Luo, Ga Wu, Hanze Li</p>
    <p>Critiquing is a method for conversational recommendation that incrementally adapts recommendations in response to user preference feedback. Specifically, a user is iteratively provided with item recommendations and attribute descriptions for those items; the user may then either accept the recommendation or choose to critique an attribute to generate a new recommendation. A recent direction known as latent linear critiquing (LLC) takes a modern embedding-based approach that seeks to optimize the combination of user preference embeddings with embeddings of critiques based on subjective item descriptions (i.e., keyphrases from user reviews); LLC does so by exploiting the linear structure of the embeddings to efficiently optimize their weights in a linear programming (LP) formulation. In this paper, we revisit LLC and note that it’s score-based optimization approach inherently encourages extreme weightings in order to maximize predicted score gaps between preferred and non-preferred items. Noting that the overall end task objective in critiquing is to re-rank rather than re-score, in this paper we take a ranking optimization approach that seeks to optimize embedding weights based on observed rank violations from earlier critiquing iterations. We evaluate the proposed framework on two recommendation datasets containing user reviews. Empirical results demonstrate that ranking-based LLC generally outperforms scoring-based LLC and other baselines across a variety of datasets, critiquing styles, and both satisfaction and session-length performance metrics.</p>

    <h3>Style Conditioned Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamelia Aryafar, Murium Iqbal, Timothy Anderton</p>
    <p>We propose Style Conditioned Recommendations (SCR) and introduce style injection as a method to diversify recommendations. We use Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) architecture, where both the encoder and decoder are conditioned on a user profile learned from item content data. This allows us to apply style transfer methodologies to the task of recommendations, which we refer to as injection. To enable style injection, user profiles are learned to be interpretable such that they express users’ propensities for specific predefined styles. These are learned via label-propagation from a dataset of item content, with limited labeled points. To perform injection, the condition on the encoder is learned while the condition on the decoder is selected per explicit feedback. Explicit feedback can be taken either from a user’s response to a style or interest quiz, or from item ratings. In the absence of explicit feedback, the condition at the encoder is applied to the decoder. We show a 12% improvement on NDCG@20 over the traditional VAE based approach on the task of recommendations. We show an average 22% improvement on AUC across all classes for predicting user style profiles against our best performing baseline. After injecting styles we compare the user style profile to the style of the recommendations and show that injected styles have an average +133% increase in presence. Our results show that style injection is a powerful method to diversify recommendations while maintaining personal relevance. Our main contribution is an application of a semi-supervised approach that extends item labels to interpretable user profiles.</p>
