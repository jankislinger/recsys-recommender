    <h3>The effect of third party implementations on reproducibility (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ádám Tibor Czapp, Balázs Hidasi</p>
    <p>Reproducibility of recommender systems research has come under scrutiny during recent years. Along with works focusing on repeating experiments with certain algorithms, the research community has also started discussing various aspects of evaluation and how these affect reproducibility. We add a novel angle to this discussion by examining how unofficial third-party implementations could benefit or hinder reproducibility. Besides giving a general overview, we thoroughly examine six third-party implementations of a popular recommender algorithm and compare them to the official version on five public datasets. In the light of our alarming findings we aim to draw the attention of the research community to this neglected aspect of reproducibility.</p>

    <h3>OSMRec Tool for Automatic Recommendation of Categories on Spatial Entities in OpenStreetMap (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Skoutas, Spiros Athanasiou, Giorgos Giannopoulos, Nikos Karagiannakis</p>
    <p>In this demonstration, we present OSMRec, a command line utility and JOSM plugin for automatic recommendation of tags (categories) on newly created spatial entities in OpenStreetMap (OSM). JOSM allows downloading parts of OSM, editing the map (e.g. inserting, deleting, annotating with tags spatial entities) and re-uploading the updated part back on OSM. OSMRec plugin exploits already annotated entities within OSM to train category classification models and utilizes these models in order to recommend OSM categories for newly inserted spatial entities in OSM.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation-based Modeling Support for Data Mining Processes (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Simon Fischer</p>
    <p>RapidMiner is a software tool that allows users to define data mining processes based on a visual model and implements a variety of so-called operators for data extraction, manipulation, model learning and analysis. The large number of available operators can however make it challenging for the process designer to identify the appropriate operator for the problem at hand. At the same time, some operators are only meaningful when combined with certain others. In this work, we evaluate different strategies of recommending additional operators to the user during the design of the process. The recommendation models are learned using a pool of several thousand existing data mining processes and evaluated in an offline experimental design. The results indicate that good predictive accuracy can already be achieved with comparably simple co-occurrence based algorithms.</p>
