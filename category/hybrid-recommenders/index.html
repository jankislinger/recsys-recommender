    <h3>VMI-PSL: Visual Model Inspector for Probabilistic Soft Logic (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aaron Rodden, Tarun Salh, Lise Getoor, Eriq Augustine</p>
    <p>Hybrid recommender systems achieve state-of-the-art performance by integrating several different information sources along with multiple recommendation approaches. Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) has been shown to be an accessible and effective means of creating extensible hybrid recommenders [11]. PSL allows users to easily create intuitive models that incorporate background information and capture complex interactions. However these complex interactions can sometimes make PSL models difficult to inspect, debug, and understand. In this paper, we present a generic visual model inspector for PSL, and show how our inspector can be used on a hybrid recommender system to: debug errors in the model, analyze the performance of individual components of the model, and explain recommendations made by the model.</p>

    <h3>Deep Learning Marketplace Recommenders in Online Experiments (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simen Eide, Ning Zhou</p>
    <p>Marketplaces are platforms where users buy and sell various types of items. Recommendation systems are widely used in marketplaces to match users with items relevant to their interests and needs. This paper focuses on online experiments with deep neural network recommenders and presents the promising recommenders we found â€“ hybrid item representation models combining features from traffic and content, sequence-based models, and multi-armed bandit models that optimize user engagement by re-ranking proposals from multiple submodels. Then it summarizes the online experiment results and discusses why some recommenders outperform others.</p>

    <h3>Do Users Matter? The Contribution of User-Driven Feature Weights to Open Dataset Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anusuriya Devaraju, Shlomo Berkovsky</p>
    <p>The vast volumes of open data pose a challenge for users in finding relevant datasets. To address this, we developed a hybrid dataset recommendation model that combines content-based similarity with item-to-item co-occurrence. The features used by the recommender include dataset properties and usage statistics. In this paper, we focus on fi ne-tuning the weights of these features. We experimentally compare two feature weighting approaches: a uniform one with predefined weights and a user-driven one, where the weights are informed by the opinions of system users. We evaluated the two approaches in a study, involving the users of a real-life data portal. The results suggest that user-driven feature weights can improve dataset recommendations, although not at all levels of data relevance, and highlight the importance of incorporating target users in the design of recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>HyPER: A Flexible and Extensible Probabilistic Framework for Hybrid Recommender Systems (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lise Getoor, Magdalini Eirinaki, James Foulds, Pigi Kouki, Shobeir Fakhraei</p>
    <p>As the amount of recorded digital information increases, there is a growing need for flexible recommender systems which can incorporate richly structured data sources to improve recommendations. In this paper, we show how a recently introduced statistical relational learning framework can be used to develop a generic and extensible hybrid recommender system. Our hybrid approach, HyPER (HYbrid Probabilistic Extensible Recommender), incorporates and reasons over a wide range of information sources. Such sources include multiple user-user and item-item similarity measures, content, and social information. HyPER automatically learns to balance these different information signals when making predictions. We build our system using a powerful and intuitive probabilistic programming language called probabilistic soft logic, which enables efficient and accurate prediction by formulating our custom recommender systems with a scalable class of graphical models known as hinge-loss Markov random fields. We experimentally evaluate our approach on two popular recommendation datasets, showing that HyPER can effectively combine multiple information types for improved performance, and can outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p>
