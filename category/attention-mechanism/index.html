    <h3>Multi-Behavioral Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shereen Elsayed, Lars Schmidt-Thieme, Ahmed Rashed</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation models are crucial for next-item prediction tasks in various online platforms, yet many focus on a single behavior, neglecting valuable implicit interactions. While multi-behavioral models address this using graph-based approaches, they often fail to capture sequential patterns simultaneously. Our proposed Multi-Behavioral Sequential Recommendation framework (MBSRec) captures the multi-behavior dependencies between the heterogeneous historical interactions via multi-head self-attention. Furthermore, we utilize a weighted binary cross-entropy loss for precise behavior control. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate MBSRec’s significant outperformance of state-of-the-art approaches. The implementation code is available here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EGRQutc9xtVYbsbXswUcTb9nvT1Tc9cZ?usp=sharing) during the review and will be added to GitHub upon acceptance.</p>

    <h3>MODEM: Decoupling User Behavior for Shared-Account Video Recommendations on Large Screen Devices (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiang Li, Lantao Hu, Zhen Zhang, Xiang Feng, Yongqi Liu, Muyang Li</p>
    <p>In scenarios involving sequence recommendations on large screen devices, such as tablets or TVs, the equipment is often shared among multiple users. This sharing leads to a mixture of behaviors from different users, posing significant challenges to recommendation systems, especially when clear supervisory signals for distinguishing among users are absent. Current solutions tend to either operate in an unsupervised manner or rely on constructed supervisory signals that are not entirely reliable. Moreover, the peculiarities of short video recommendations in this context have not been thoroughly explored in existing research. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces Multi-User Contrastive Decoupling Model (MODEM), a novel short video recommendation model specifically designed for large screen devices. MODEM leverages an attention mechanism, grounded in session segmentation, to disentangle the intertwined user behavior histories. It also discriminates between the impacts of long and short viewing behaviors on short video recommendations by cross-analyzing sequences of both. Furthermore, we have developed a contrastive learning method to oversee the decoupling of user behaviors effectively. Our evaluations demonstrate noticeable improvements through both offline assessments within public datasets and online A/B testing within Kuaishou’s short video recommendation environment on large screen devices. Specifically, our online A/B tests resulted in a 0.55% increase in watch time. These results underscore MODEM’s efficacy in enhancing recommendation quality in shared account contexts.</p>

    <h3>Entity-Aware Collections Ranking: A Joint Scoring Approach (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youhe Chen, Sihao Chen, Sheng Li, Dong Yang</p>
    <p>Recommender systems in academia and industry typically predict Click-Through Rate (CTR) at the item or entity level. In practical scenarios, products can take on various forms and designs. We present a novel joint scoring framework that supports the listwise ranking of a collection composed of multiple entities. It learns the best combination of entities to be displayed to the user. We also introduce a novel dual attention mechanism that better captures the user’s interest in the collection. Our approach demonstrated superior performance through offline and online experiments and has been deployed to Shopee’s Shop Ads across all markets.</p>

    <h3>Knowledge-based Multiple Adaptive Spaces Fusion for Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deqing Wang, Zhao Zhang, Fuzhen Zhuang, Jin Dong, Meng Yuan</p>
    <p>Since Knowledge Graphs (KGs) contain rich semantic information, recently there has been an influx of KG-enhanced recommendation methods. Most of existing methods are entirely designed based on euclidean space without considering curvature. However, recent studies have revealed that a tremendous graph-structured data exhibits highly non-euclidean properties. Motivated by these observations, in this work, we propose a knowledge-based multiple adaptive spaces fusion method for recommendation, namely MCKG. Unlike existing methods that solely adopt a specific manifold, we introduce the unified space that is compatible with hyperbolic, euclidean and spherical spaces. Furthermore, we fuse the multiple unified spaces in an attention manner to obtain the high-quality embeddings for better knowledge propagation. In addition, we propose a geometry-aware optimization strategy which enables the pull and push processes benefited from both hyperbolic and spherical spaces. Specifically, in hyperbolic space, we set smaller margins in the area near to the origin, which is conducive to distinguishing between highly similar positive items and negative ones. At the same time, we set larger margins in the area far from the origin to ensure the model has sufficient error tolerance. The similar manner also applies to spherical spaces. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the MCKG has a significant improvement over state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Further ablation experiments verify the importance of multi-space fusion and geometry-aware optimization strategy, justifying the rationality and effectiveness of MCKG.</p>

    <h3>BRUCE – Bundle Recommendation Using Contextualized item Embeddings (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Livne, Bracha Shapira, Oren Sar Shalom, Mark Last, Tzoof Avny Brosh</p>
    <p>A bundle is a pre-defined set of items that are collected together. In many domains, bundling is one of the most important marketing strategies for item promotion, commonly used in e-commerce. Bundle recommendation resembles the item recommendation task, where bundles are the recommended unit, but it poses additional challenges; while item recommendation requires only user and item understanding, bundle recommendation also requires modeling the connections between the various items in a bundle. Transformers have driven the state-of-the-art methods for set and sequence modeling in various natural language processing and computer vision tasks, emphasizing the understanding that the neighbors of an element are of crucial importance. Under some required adjustments, we believe the same applies for items in bundles, and better capturing the relations of an item with other items in the bundle may lead to improved recommendations. To address that, we introduce BRUCE - a novel model for bundle recommendation, in which we adapt Transformers to represent data on users, items, and bundles. This allows exploiting the self-attention mechanism to model the following: latent relations between the items in a bundle; and users’ preferences toward each of the items in the bundle and toward the whole bundle. Moreover, we examine various architectures to integrate the items’ and the users’ information and provide insights on architecture selection based on data characteristics. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach contributes to the accuracy of the recommendation and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods</p>

    <h3>Global-Local Item Embedding for Temporal Set Prediction (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiun Kim, Minkyu Kim, Young-Jin Park, Jisu Jeong, Seungjae Jung, Hanock Kwak, Kyung-Min Kim</p>
    <p>Temporal set prediction is becoming increasingly important as many companies employ recommender systems in their online businesses, e.g., personalized purchase prediction of shopping baskets. While most previous techniques have focused on leveraging a user’s history, the study of combining it with others’ histories remains untapped potential. This paper proposes Global-Local Item Embedding (GLOIE) that learns to utilize the temporal properties of sets across whole users as well as within a user by coining the names as global and local information to distinguish the two temporal patterns. GLOIE uses Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and dynamic graph-based model to capture global and local information and then applies attention to integrate resulting item embeddings. Additionally, we propose to use Tweedie output for the decoder of VAE as it can easily model zero-inflated and long-tailed distribution, which is more suitable for several real-world data distributions than Gaussian or multinomial counterparts. When evaluated on three public benchmarks, our algorithm consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in most ranking metrics.</p>

    <h3>Semantic-based Tag Recommendation in Scientific Bookmarking Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hebatallah A. Mohamed Hassan</p>
    <p>Recently, tagging has become a common way for users to organize and share digital content, and tag recommendation (TR) has become a very important research topic. Most of the recommendation approaches which are based on text embedding have utilized bag-of-words technique. On the other hand, proposed deep learning methods for capturing semantic meanings in the text, have been proved to be effective in various natural language processing (NLP) applications. In this paper, we present a content-based TR method that adopts deep recurrent neural networks to encode titles and abstracts of scientific articles into semantic vectors for enhancing the recommendation task, specifically bidirectional gated recurrent units (bi-GRUs) with attention mechanism. The experimental evaluation is performed on a dataset from CiteULike. The overall findings show that the proposed model is effective in representing scientific articles for tag recommendation.</p>
