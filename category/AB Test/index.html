    <h3>Balancing Habit Repetition and New Activity Exploration: A Longitudinal Micro-Randomized Trial in Physical Activity Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ine Coppens, Luc Martens, Toon De Pessemier</p>
    <p>As repetition of activities can establish habits and exploration of new ones can provide a healthy variety, we investigate how a recommender system for physical activities can optimally balance these two approaches. We conducted an eight-week user study with 62 physically inactive participants who receive personalized repetition and exploration recommendations in a random order. We distinguish between location, workout, and general activities, and collect participants’ subjective perceptions. Our findings indicate that participants initially preferred exploring general activities, but rated repeating recommendations higher after two weeks. By exploring the optimal transition point from exploration to repetition in personalized recommendations, this study contributes to designing more effective recommender systems for health improvement and healthy habit formation.</p>

    <h3>Exploratory Analysis of Recommending Urban Parks for Health-Promoting Activities (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Quercia, Sanja Šćepanović, Ke Zhou, Linus W. Dietz</p>
    <p>Parks are essential spaces for promoting urban health, and recommender systems could assist individuals in discovering parks for leisure and health-promoting activities. This is particularly important in large cities like London, which has over 1,500 named parks, making it challenging to understand what each park offers. Due to the lack of datasets and the diverse health-promoting activities parks can support (e.g., physical, social, nature-appreciation), it is unclear which recommendation algorithms are best suited for this task. To explore the dynamics of recommending parks for specific activities, we created two datasets: one from a survey of over 250 London residents, and another by inferring visits from over 1 million geotagged Flickr images taken in London parks. Analyzing the geographic patterns of these visits revealed that recommending nearby parks is ineffective, suggesting that this recommendation task is distinct from Point of Interest recommendation. We then tested various recommendation models, identifying a significant popularity bias in the results. Additionally, we found that personalized models have advantages in recommending parks beyond the most popular ones. The data and findings from this study provide a foundation for future research on park recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Encouraging Exploration in Spotify Search through Query Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henrik Lindstrom, Humberto Jesús Corona Pampín, Alva Liu, Enrico Palumbo</p>
    <p>At Spotify, search has been traditionally seen as a tool for retrieving content, with the search system optimized for when the user has a specific search target in mind. In particular we have relied on an instant search system providing results for each keystroke, which works well for known-item search, when queries are straightforward, and the catalog is small. However, as Spotify’s catalog grows in size and variety, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to define their search intents accurately. Furthermore, as we expand the offering, we need to help users discover more content both when it comes to new content types, e.g. audiobooks, as well as for new content/creators within existing content types. To solve this we have introduced a hybrid Query Recommendation system (QR) that helps the user formulate more complex exploratory search intents, while still serving known-item lookups efficiently. This experience has been rolled out worldwide to all mobile users resulting in an increase in exploratory intent queries of ~9% in online A/B tests.</p>

    <h3>AIE: Auction Information Enhanced Framework for CTR Prediction in Online Advertising (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenxu Zhu, Muyu Zhang, Yang Yang, Huifeng Guo, Menghui Zhu, Bo Chen, Ruiming Tang, Zhenhua Dong, Xinyi Dai</p>
    <p>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a fundamental technique for online advertising recommendation and the complex online competitive auction process also brings many difficulties to CTR optimization. Recent studies have shown that introducing posterior auction information contributes to the performance of CTR prediction. However, existing work doesn’t fully capitalize on the benefits of auction information and overlooks the data bias brought by the auction, leading to biased and suboptimal results. To address these limitations, we propose Auction Information Enhanced Framework (AIE) for CTR prediction in online advertising, which delves into the problem of insufficient utilization of auction signals and first reveals the auction bias. Specifically, AIE introduces two pluggable modules, namely Adaptive Market-price AuxiliaryModule (AM2) and Bid Calibration Module (BCM), which work collaboratively to excavate the posterior auction signals better and enhance the performance of CTR prediction. Furthermore, the two proposed modules are lightweight, model-agnostic and friendly to inference latency. Extensive experiments are conducted on a public dataset and an industrial dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and compatibility of AIE. Besides, a one-month online A/B test in a large-scale advertising platform shows that AIE improves the base model by 5.76% and 2.44% in terms of eCPM and CTR, respectively.</p>

    <h3>On Interpretability of Linear Autoencoders (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ladislav Peska, Martin Spišák, Radek Bartyzal, Antonín Hoskovec</p>
    <p>We derive a novel graph-based interpretation of linear autoencoder models EASE, SLIM, and their approximate variants. Contrary to popular belief, we reveal that the weights of these models should not be interpreted as dichotomic item similarity but merely as its magnitude. Consequently, we propose a simple modification that considerably improves retrieval ability in sparse domains and yields interpretable inference with negative inputs, as demonstrated by our offline and online experiments.</p>

    <h3>“More to Read” at the Los Angeles Times: Solving a Cold Start Problem with LLMs to Improve Story Discovery (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Kaufman, Franklin Horn, Aurelia Alston, Won You</p>
    <p>News publishers, who are seeking to grow their digital audience, face a challenge in providing relevant content recommendations for unregistered users arriving directly to article pages. In these cold start scenarios, classic techniques, like asking a user to register and select topics of interest, fall short. We present a contextual targeting approach that leverages the user’s current article choice itself as an implicit signal of user interests. We designed and developed an interface with recommendations to help users discover more articles. Our online A/B testing demonstrated that our models increased click-through rates by 39.4% over a popularity baseline. One of them, a large language model (LLM), generates relevant recommendations that balance immersion and novelty. We discuss the implications of using LLMs for responsibly enhancing user experiences while upholding editorial standards. We identify key opportunities in detecting nuanced user preferences and identifying and interrupting filter bubbles on news publisher sites.</p>

    <h3>Self-Auxiliary Distillation for Sample Efficient Learning in Google-Scale Recommenders (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruoxi Wang, Tiansheng Yao, Ed H. Chi, Andrew Evdokimov, Yuan Gao, Jerry Zhang, Evan Ettinger, Derek Zhiyuan Cheng, Yin Zhang, Jonathan Valverde, Xiang Li</p>
    <p>Industrial recommendation systems process billions of daily user feedback which are complex and noisy. Efficiently uncovering user preference from these signals becomes crucial for high-quality recommendation. We argue that those signals are not inherently equal in terms of their informative value and training ability, which is particularly salient in industrial applications with multi-stage processes (e.g., augmentation, retrieval, ranking). Considering that, in this work, we propose a novel self-auxiliary distillation framework that prioritizes training on high-quality labels, and improves the resolution of low-quality labels through distillation by adding a bilateral branch-based auxiliary task. This approach enables flexible learning from diverse labels without additional computational costs, making it highly scalable and effective for Google-scale recommenders. Our framework consistently improved both offline and online key business metrics across three Google major products. Notably, self-auxiliary distillation proves to be highly effective in addressing the severe signal loss challenge posed by changes such as Apple iOS policy. It further delivered significant improvements in both offline (+17\% AUC) and online metrics for a Google Apps recommendation system. This highlights the opportunities of addressing real-world signal loss problems through self-auxiliary distillation techniques.</p>

    <h3>Navigating the Feedback Loop in Recommender Systems: Insights and Strategies from Industry Practice (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ding Tong, Justin Basilico, James McInerney, Ting-Po Lee, Qifeng Qiao</p>
    <p>Understanding and measuring the impact of feedback loops in industrial recommender systems is challenging, leading to the underestimation of the deterioration. In this study, we define open and closed feedback loops and investigate the unique reasons behind the emergence of feedback loops in the industry, drawing from real-world examples that have received limited attention in prior research. We highlight the measurement challenges associated with capturing the full impact of feedback loops using traditional online A/B tests. To address this, we propose the use of offline evaluation frameworks as surrogates for long-term feedback loop bias, supported by a practical simulation system using real data. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the performance of recommender systems operating under feedback loop conditions.</p>

    <h3>Deep Situation-Aware Interaction Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongkang Wang, Dong Wang, Yisong Yu, Beihong Jin, Yapeng Zhang, Jian Dong, Xingxing Wang, Shuli Wang, Yimin Lv</p>
    <p>User behavior sequence modeling plays a significant role in Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction on e-commerce platforms. Except for the interacted items, user behaviors contain rich interaction information, such as the behavior type, time, location, etc. However, so far, the information related to user behaviors has not yet been fully exploited. In the paper, we propose the concept of a situation and situational features for distinguishing interaction behaviors and then design a CTR model named Deep Situation-Aware Interaction Network (DSAIN). DSAIN first adopts the reparameterization trick to reduce noise in the original user behavior sequences. Then it learns the embeddings of situational features by feature embedding parameterization and tri-directional correlation fusion. Finally, it obtains the embedding of behavior sequence via heterogeneous situation aggregation. We conduct extensive offline experiments on three real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DSAIN model. More importantly, DSAIN has increased the CTR by 2.70\%, the CPM by 2.62\%, and the GMV by 2.16\% in the online A/B test. Now, DSAIN has been deployed on the Meituan food delivery platform and serves the main traffic of the Meituan takeout app. Our source code is available at https://github.com/W-void/DSAIN</p>

    <h3>Position Awareness Modeling with Knowledge Distillation for CTR Prediction (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuejiang Li, Fei Teng, Zhangang Lin, Jingping Shao, Congcong Liu, Changping Peng, Jian Zhu, Xiwei Zhao</p>
    <p>Click-through rate (CTR) Prediction is of great importance in real-world online ads systems. One challenge for the CTR prediction task is to capture the real interest of users from their clicked items, which is inherently influenced by presented positions of items, i.e., more front positions tend to obtain higher CTR values. Therefore, It is crucial to make CTR models aware of the exposed position of the items. A popular line of existing works focuses on explicitly model exposed position by result randomization which is expensive and inefficient, or by inverse propensity weighting (IPW) which relies heavily on the quality of the propensity estimation. Another common solution is modeling position as features during offline training and simply adopting fixed value or dropout tricks when serving. However, training-inference inconsistency can lead to sub-optimal performance. This work proposes a simple yet efficient knowledge distillation framework to model the impact of exposed position and leverage position information to improve CTR prediction. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method on a real-world production dataset and online A/B tests, achieving significant improvements over competing baseline models. The proposed method has been deployed in the real world online ads systems of JD, serving main traffic of hundreds of millions of active users.</p>

    <h3>Two-Layer Bandit Optimization for Recommendations (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Humeyra Topcu Altintas, Puja Das, Aaron Chen, Sofia Maria Nikolakaki, Siyong Ma</p>
    <p>Online commercial app marketplaces serve millions of apps to billions of users in an efficient manner. Bandit optimization algorithms are used to ensure that the recommendations are relevant, and converge to the best performing content over time. However, directly applying bandits to real-world systems, where the catalog of items is dynamic and continuously refreshed, is not straightforward. One of the challenges we face is the existence of several competing content surfacing components, a phenomenon not unusual in large-scale recommender systems. This often leads to challenging scenarios, where improving the recommendations in one component can lead to performance degradation of another, i.e., “cannibalization”. To address this problem we introduce an efficient two-layer bandit approach which is contextualized to user cohorts of similar taste. We mitigate cannibalization at runtime within a single multi-intent content surfacing platform by formalizing relevant offline evaluation metrics, and by involving the cross-component interactions in the bandit rewards. The user engagement in our proposed system has more than doubled as measured by online A/B testings.</p>

    <h3>Who do you think I am? Interactive User Modelling with Item Metadata (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bart Goethals, Koen Ruymbeek, Joey De Pauw</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are used in many different applications and contexts, however their main goal can always be summarised as “connecting relevant content to interested users”. Explanations have been found to help recommender systems achieve this goal by giving users a look under the hood that helps them understand why they are recommended certain items. Furthermore, explanations can be considered to be the first step towards interacting with the system. Indeed, for a user to give feedback and guide the system towards better understanding her preferences, it helps if the user has a better idea of what the system has already learned.<br>To this end, we propose a linear collaborative filtering recommendation model that builds user profiles within the domain of item metadata. Our method is hence inherently transparent and explainable. Moreover, since recommendations are computed as a linear function of item metadata and the interpretable user profile, our method seamlessly supports interactive recommendation. In other words, users can directly tweak the weights of the learned profile for more fine-grained browsing and discovery of content based on their current interests. We demonstrate the interactive aspect of this model in an online application for discovering cultural events in Belgium.</p>

    <p>At Peloton, we are challenged to not just surface relevant recommendations of fitness classes to our members, but also timely ones. As our fitness content library expands, we continually produce classes on certain themes which are most timely during a narrow time window. To address this challenge, we provide some control over our recommendations to external stakeholders, such as production and marketing teams. They enter timed boosts of certain classes during the windows they are relevant in. We have built out algorithms which take these desired classes and elevate the number of impressions for them, while preserving members’ engagement with our recommendations. In this paper, we discuss the system, the algorithms and some results from a few A/B tests showing how boosting works in practice.</p>
