    <h3>Bridging Search and Recommendation in Generative Retrieval: Does One Task Help the Other? (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco De Nadai, Ali Vardasbi, Enrico Palumbo, Hugues Bouchard, Gustavo Penha</p>
    <p>Generative retrieval for search and recommendation is a promising paradigm for retrieving items, offering an alternative to traditional methods that depend on external indexes and nearest-neighbor searches. Instead, generative models directly associate inputs with item IDs. Given the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), these generative systems play a crucial role in centralizing a variety of Information Retrieval (IR) tasks in a single model that performs tasks such as query understanding, retrieval, recommendation, explanation, re-ranking, and response generation. Despite the growing interest in such a unified generative approach for IR systems, the advantages of using a single, multi-task model over multiple specialized models are not well established in the literature. This paper investigates whether and when such a unified approach can outperform task-specific models in the IR tasks of search and recommendation, broadly co-existing in multiple industrial online platforms, such as Spotify, YouTube, and Netflix. Previous work shows that (1) the latent representations of items, learned by generative recommenders, are biased towards popularity, and (2) content-based and collaborative-filtering-based information can improve an item’s representations. Motivated by this, our study is guided by two hypotheses: [H1] the joint training regularizes the estimation of each item’s popularity, and [H2] the joint training regularizes the item’s latent representations, where search captures content-based aspects of an item and recommendation captures collaborative-filtering aspects. Our extensive experiments with both simulated and real-world data support both [H1] and [H2] as key contributors to the effectiveness improvements observed in the unified search and recommendation generative models over the single-task approaches.</p>

    <h3>Ghosting: Contextualized Inline Query Completion in Large Scale Retail Search (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uma Murthy, Lakshmi Ramachandran</p>
    <p>Query auto-completion presents a ranked list of queries as suggestions for a user-entered prefix. Ghosting is the process of auto-completing a search recommendation by highlighting the suggested text inline within the search box. We propose the use of a behavior-based recommendation model along with customer search context to ghost on high-confidence queries. We tested ghosting on a retail production system, on over 140 million search sessions. We found that session-context based ghosting significantly increased the acceptance of offered suggestions by 6.18%, reduced misspellings among searches by 4.42%, and improved net sales by 0.14%.</p>

    <h3>Learning to Measure Quality of Queries for Automatic Query Suggestion (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian Chen, Hyoseop Shin</p>
    <p>Users tend to use their own terms to search items in structured search systems such as restaurant searches (e.g. Yelp), but due to users’ lack of understanding on internal vocabulary and structures, they often fail to adequately search, which leads to unsatisfying search results. In this case, search systems should assist users to use different terms for better search results. To address this issue, we develop a scheme to generate suggested queries, given a user query. At first in doing this, in this paper we propose a scheme to evaluate queries (i.e. user queries and/or suggested queries) based on two measures: 1) if the query will return a sufficient number of search results, 2) if the query will return search results of high quality. Furthermore, we present a learning model to choose among alternative candidate queries against a user query. Our experiments show the proposed method is feasible and scalable.</p>
