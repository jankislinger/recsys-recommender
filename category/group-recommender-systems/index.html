    <h3>Long-term fairness for Group Recommender Systems with Large Groups (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrik Dokoupil</p>
    <p>Group recommender systems (GRS) focus on recommending items to groups of users. GRS need to tackle the heterogeneity of group members’ preferences and produce recommendations of high overall utility while also considering some sense of fairness among group members. This work plans to aim for novel applications of GRS involving construction of large-scale groups of users and focusing on the long-term fairness of these groups which is in contrast with current research that concentrates on small groups of ephemeral nature. We believe that these directions could bring results of significant societal impact and scope of the effect expanding beyond currently considered GRS domains, e.g., helping to mitigate the filter bubble problem</p>

    <h3>Recommending New Items to Ephemeral Groups Using Contextual User Influence (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Letizia Tanca, Elisa Quintarelli, Emanuele Rabosio</p>
    <p>Group recommender systems help groups of users in finding appropriate items to be enjoyed together. Lots of activities, like watching TV or going to the restaurant, are intrinsically group-based, thus making the group recommendation problem very relevant. In this paper we study ephemeral groups, i.e., groups where the members might be together for the first time. Recent approaches have tackled this issue introducing complex models to be learned offline, making them unable to deal with new items; on the contrary, we propose a group recommender able to manage new items too. In more detail, our technique determines the preference of a group for an item by combining the individual preferences of the group members on the basis of their contextual influence, where the contextual influence represents the ability of an individual, in a given situation, to direct the group’s decision. We conducted an extensive experimental evaluation on a TV dataset containing a log of viewings performed by real groups, showing how our approach outperforms the comparable techniques from the literature.</p>

    <h3>Voting Operations for a Group Recommender System in a Distributed User Interface Environment. (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Part Saelim, Wolfgang Wörndl</p>
    <p>This work investigates distributed user interfaces for group recommender systems. In our scenario of a movie recommender, the user interface is distributed on two platforms: personal mobile devices and a public multi-touch tabletop. Our solution proposes voting operations to better support the consensus building among group members. We have implemented a prototype and conducted a preliminary user study with interesting results.</p>
