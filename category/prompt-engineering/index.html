    <h3>User knowledge prompt for sequential recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuuki Tachioka</p>
    <p>The large language model (LLM) based recommendation system is effective for sequential recommendation, because general knowledge of popular items is included in the LLM. To add domain knowledge of items, the conventional method uses a knowledge prompt obtained from the item knowledge graphs and has achieved SOTA performance. However, for personalized recommendation, it is necessary to consider user knowledge, which the conventional method does not fully consider because user knowledge is not included in the item knowledge graphs; thus, we propose a user knowledge prompt, which converts a user knowledge graph into a prompt using the relationship template. The existing prompt denoising framework is extended to prevent hallucination caused by undesirable interactions between knowledge graph prompts. We propose user knowledge prompts of user traits and user preferences and associate relevant items. Experiments on three types of dataset (movie, music, and book) show the significant and consistent improvement of our proposed user knowledge prompt.</p>

    <h3>Uncovering ChatGPT’s Capabilities in Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihua Si, Chen Xu, Haiyuan Zhao, Xiao Zhang, Weijie Yu, Zhongxiang Sun, Jun Xu, Ninglu Shao, Sunhao Dai</p>
    <p>The debut of ChatGPT has recently attracted significant attention from the natural language processing (NLP) community and beyond. Existing studies have demonstrated that ChatGPT shows significant improvement in a range of downstream NLP tasks, but the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in terms of recommendations remain unclear. In this study, we aim to enhance ChatGPT’s recommendation capabilities by aligning it with traditional information retrieval (IR) ranking capabilities, including point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise ranking. To achieve this goal, we re-formulate the aforementioned three recommendation policies into prompt formats tailored specifically to the domain at hand.  Through extensive experiments on four datasets from different domains, we analyze the distinctions among the three recommendation policies. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT achieves an optimal balance between cost and performance when equipped with list-wise ranking. This research sheds light on a promising direction for aligning ChatGPT with recommendation tasks.
