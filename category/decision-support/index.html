    <h3>Multi-Step Critiquing User Interface for Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diana Andreea Petrescu, Diego Antognini, Boi Faltings</p>
    <p>Recommendations with personalized explanations have been shown to increase user trust and perceived quality and help users make better decisions. Moreover, such explanations allow users to provide feedback by critiquing them. Several algorithms for recommender systems with multi-step critiquing have therefore been developed. However, providing a user-friendly interface based on personalized explanations and critiquing has not been addressed in the last decade. In this paper, we introduce four different web interfaces (available under https://lia.epfl.ch/critiquing/) helping users making decisions and finding their ideal item. We have chosen the hotel recommendation domain as a use case even though our approach is trivially adaptable for other domains. Moreover, our system is model-agnostic (for both recommender systems and critiquing models) allowing a great flexibility and further extensions. Our interfaces are above all a useful tool to help research in recommendation with critiquing. They allow to test such systems on a real use case and also to highlight some limitations of these approaches to find solutions to overcome them.</p>

    <h3>Automated Recommendation of Healthy, Personalised Meal Plans (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Morgan Harvey, David Elsweiler</p>
    <p>Poor health due to a lack of understanding of nutrition is a major problem in the modern world, one which could potentially be addressed via the use of recommender systems. In this demo we present a system to generate meal plans for users which they will not only like, based on their taste preferences, but will also conform to daily nutritional guidelines. The interface allows the selection of recipes for breakfast, lunch and dinner and can automatically complete a daily meal plan or can generate entire plans itself.</p>
