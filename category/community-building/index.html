    <h3>Educational Question Routing in Online Student Communities (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Srba, Jakub Macina, Joseph Jay Williams, Maria Bielikova</p>
    <p>Students’ performance in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is enhanced by high quality discussion forums or recently emerging educational Community Question Answering (CQA) systems. Nevertheless, only a small number of students answer questions asked by their peers. This results in instructor overload, and many unanswered questions. To increase students’ participation, we present an approach for recommendation of new questions to students who are likely to provide answers. Existing approaches to such question routing proposed for non-educational CQA systems tend to rely on a few experts, which is not suitable because we want students to be engaged as it positively influences their learning outcomes. In tackling this novel educational question routing problem, our method (1) goes beyond previous question-answering data as it incorporate additional non-QA data from the course (to improve prediction accuracy and to involve a larger part of community) and (2) applies constraints on users’ workload (to prevent user overloading). We use an ensemble classifier for predicting students’ willingness to answer a question, as well as the students’ expertise for answering. We conducted an online evaluation of the proposed method using an A/B test in our CQA system deployed at an edX MOOC. The proposed method outperformed a baseline method (non-educational question routing enhanced with workload restriction) in recommendation accuracy, involving more community members, and average number of contributions.</p>
