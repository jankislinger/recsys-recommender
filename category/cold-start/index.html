    <h3>Scene-wise Adaptive Network for Dynamic Cold-start Scenes Optimization in CTR Prediction (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Tang, Wenhao Li, Jie Zhou, Shixiong Zhao, Chuan Luo, Kun Zhang</p>
    <p>In the realm of modern mobile E-commerce, providing users with nearby commercial service recommendations through location-based online services has become increasingly vital. While machine learning approaches have shown promise in multi-scene recommendation, existing methodologies often struggle to address cold-start problems in unprecedented scenes: the increasing diversity of commercial choices, along with the short online lifespan of scenes, give rise to the complexity of effective recommendations in online and dynamic scenes. In this work, we propose Scene-wise Adaptive Network (SwAN), a novel approach that emphasizes high-performance cold-start online recommendations for new scenes. Our approach introduces several crucial capabilities, including scene similarity learning, user-specific scene transition cognition, scene-specific information construction for the new scene, and enhancing the diverged logical information between scenes. We demonstrate SwAN’s potential to optimize dynamic multi-scene recommendation problems by effectively online handling cold-start recommendations for any newly arrived scenes. More encouragingly, SwAN has been successfully deployed in Company M’s online catering recommendation service, which serves millions of customers per day, and SwAN has achieved a 5.64% CTR index improvement relative to the baselines and a 5.19% increase in daily order volume proportion.</p>

    <h3>Optimizing for Participation in Recommender System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourabh Bansod, Yaping Zhang, Bibang Liu, Mingyan Gao, Yuan Shao, Arnab Bhadury</p>
    <p>The traditional recommender system has been designed to mostly optimize for viewer consumption, and with the rise of short form videos, the boundaries between consumption and participation have blurred. This shift presents an opportunity to optimize recommender systems not only for passive consumption, but also for active participation in content creation. In this paper, we document the development of a recommender system that provides inspiration to existing content uploaders and new future content uploaders to encourage participation. Our contributions are two-fold: 1) Inspiration Framework: We present a novel framework for building a recommender system that goes beyond traditional consumption-focused metrics, specifically addressing the need for creative inspiration to lower barriers for participation. This framework is adaptable in the design of large-scale recommender systems in other domains. 2) Empirical Evaluation: We conduct systematic evaluation via live experiments to prove the values of the proposed system in increasing daily participation and participants.</p>

    <h3>Multimodal Representation Learning for high-quality Recommendations in Cold-start and Beyond-Accuracy (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marta Moscati</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RS) traditionally leverage the large amount of user–item interaction data. This exposes RS to a lower recommendation quality in cold-start scenarios, as well as to a low recommendation quality in terms of beyond-accuracy evaluation metrics. State-of-the-art (SotA) models for cold-start scenarios rely on the use of side information on the items or the users, therefore relating recommendation to multimodal machine learning (ML). However, the most recent techniques from multimodal ML are often not applied to the domain of recommendation. Additionally, the evaluation of SotA multimodal RS often neglects beyond-accuracy aspects of recommendation. In this work, we outline research into designing novel multimodal RS based on SotA multimodal ML architectures for cold-start recommendation, and their evaluation and benchmark with preexisting multimodal RS in terms of accuracy and beyond-accuracy aspects of recommendation quality.</p>

    <h3>A Multi-modal Modeling Framework for Cold-start Short-video Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Gai, Han Li, Ruina Sun, Jingjian Lin, Xinghua Zhang, Gaode Chen, Qi Zhang, Jiangxia Cao, Yuezihan Jiang</p>
    <p>Short video has witnessed rapid growth in the past few years in multimedia platforms. To ensure the freshness of the videos, platforms receive a large number of user-uploaded videos every day, making collaborative filtering-based recommender methods suffer from the item cold-start problem (e.g., the new-coming videos are difficult to compete with existing videos). Consequently, increasing efforts tackle the cold-start issue from the content perspective, focusing on modeling the multi-modal preferences of users, a fair way to compete with new-coming and existing videos. However, recent studies ignore the existing gap between multi-modal embedding extraction and user interest modeling as well as the discrepant intensities of user preferences for different modalities. In this paper, we propose M3CSR, a multi-modal modeling framework for cold-start short video recommendation. Specifically, we preprocess content-oriented multi-modal features for items and obtain trainable category IDs by performing clustering. In each modality, we combine modality-specific cluster ID embedding and the mapped original modality feature as modality-specific representation of the item to address the gap. Meanwhile, M3CSR measures the user modality-specific intensity based on the correlation between modality-specific interest and behavioral interest and employs pairwise loss to further decouple user multi-modal interests. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model. The framework has been deployed on a billion-user scale short video application and has shown improvements in various commercial metrics within cold-start scenarios.</p>

    <h3>A Pre-trained Zero-shot Sequential Recommendation Framework via Popularity Dynamics (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hari Sundaram, Junting Wang, Praneet Rathi</p>
    <p>This paper proposes a novel pre-trained framework for zero-shot cross-domain  sequential recommendation without auxiliary information. While using auxiliary information (e.g., item descriptions) seems promising for cross-domain transfer, a cross-domain adaptation of sequential recommenders can be challenging when the target domain differs from the source domain—item descriptions are in different languages; metadata modalities (e.g., audio, image, and text) differ across source and target domains. If we can learn universal item representations independent of the domain type (e.g., groceries, movies), we can achieve zero-shot cross-domain transfer without auxiliary information. Our critical insight is that user interaction sequences highlight shifting user preferences via the popularity dynamics of interacted items. We present a pre-trained sequential recommendation framework: PrepRec, which utilizes a novel popularity dynamics-aware transformer architecture. Through extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, we show that PrepRec, without any auxiliary information, can zero-shot adapt to new application domains and achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art sequential recommender models. In addition, we show that PrepRec complements existing sequential recommenders. With a simple post-hoc interpolation, PrepRec improves the performance of existing sequential recommenders on average by 11.8% in Recall@10 and 22% in NDCG@10. We provide an anonymized implementation of PrepRec at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PrepRec–128E/}.</p>

    <h3>Prompt Tuning for Item Cold-start Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingchi Wang, Gaode Chen, Qi Zhang, Jingjian Lin, Yuezihan Jiang, Kaigui Bian, Wenhan Zhang, Peng Jiang, Yinjie Jiang</p>
    <p>The item cold-start problem is crucial for online recommender systems, as the success of the cold-start phase determines whether items can transition into popular ones. Prompt learning, a powerful technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to address zero- or few-shot problems, has been adapted for recommender systems to tackle similar challenges. However, existing methods typically rely on content-based properties or text descriptions for prompting, which we argue may be suboptimal for cold-start recommendations due to 1) semantic gaps with recommender tasks, 2) model bias caused by warm-up items contribute most of positive feedback to the model, which is the core of the cold-start problem that hinder the recommender quality on cold-start items. We propose to leverage high-value positive feedback, termed pinnacle feedback as prompt information, to simultaneously resolve the above two problems. We experimentally prove that comparing to content description proposed in existing works, the positive feedback is more suitable to serve as prompt information by bridging the semantic gaps. Besides, we propose item-wise personalized prompt networks to encode pinnaclce feedback to relieve the model bias by the positive feedback dominance problem. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, PROMO has been successfully deployed on a popular short-video sharing platform, a billion-user scale commercial short-video application, achieving remarkable performance gains across various commercial metrics within cold-start scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Learned Ranking Function: From Short-term Behavior Predictions to Long-term User Satisfaction (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Wu, Jennifer She, Daryl Chang, Lukasz Heldt, Zhe Zhao, Li Wei</p>
    <p>We present the Learned Ranking Function (LRF), a system that takes short-term user-item behavior predictions as input and outputs a slate of recommendations directly optimizing for long-term user satisfaction. Most previous work is based on optimizing hyper-parameters of a heuristic function. We propose to model the problem directly as a slate optimization problem with the objective of maximizing long-term user satisfaction. We also develop a new constraint optimization method that is able to improve the stability for multi-objective optimization. We evaluate our approach with live experiments and describe its deployment on YouTube.</p>

    <h3>The Fault in Our Recommendations: On the Perils of Optimizing the Measurable (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshit Kumar, Yash Kanoria, Omar Besbes</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems play a pivotal role on digital platforms by curating content, products and services for users. These systems are widespread, and through customized recommendations, promise to match users with options they will like. To that end,  data on engagement is collected and used, with, e.g., measurements of clicks, but also  purchases or consumption times.   Most recommendation systems are ranking-based, where they rank and recommend items based on their predicted engagement.  However, the engagement signals  are often only a crude proxy for user utility, as data on the latter is rarely collected or available. This paper explores the following critical research question: By optimizing for measurable proxies, are recommendation systems at risk of significantly under-delivering on user utility? If that is indeed the case, how can one improve utility which is seldom measured? To study these questions, we introduce a model of repeated user consumption in which, at each interaction, users select between an outside option and the best option from a recommendation set. Our model accounts for user heterogeneity, with the majority preferring “popular” content, and a minority favoring “niche” content. The system initially lacks knowledge of individual user preferences but can learn these preferences through observations of users’ choices over time. Our theoretical and numerical analysis demonstrate that optimizing for engagement signals can lead to significant utility losses. Instead, we propose a utility-aware policy that initially recommends a mix of popular and niche content. We show that such a policy substantially improves  utility despite not measuring it. In fact, in the limit of a forward-looking platform with discount factor $\delta \to 1$, our utility-aware policy achieves the best of both worlds: near-optimal user utility and near-optimal engagement simultaneously. Our study elucidates  an important feature of recommendation systems; given the ability to suggest multiple items, one can perform significant exploration without incurring significant reductions in short term engagement. By recommending high-risk, high-reward items alongside popular items, systems can enhance discovery of high utility items without significantly affecting engagement.</p>

    <h3>The MovieLens Beliefs Dataset: Collecting Pre-Choice Data for Online Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guy Aridor, Duarte Goncalves, Daniel Kluver, Ruoyan Kong, Joseph Konstan</p>
    <p>An increasingly important aspect of designing recommender systems involves considering how recommendations will influence consumer choices. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a method for collecting user beliefs about un-experienced items – a critical predictor of choice behavior. We implemented this method on the MovieLens platform, resulting in a rich dataset that combines user ratings, beliefs, and observed recommendations. We document challenges to such data collection, including selection bias in response and limited coverage of the product space. This unique resource empowers researchers to delve deeper into user behavior and analyze user choices absent recommendations, measure the effectiveness of recommendations, and prototype algorithms that leverage user belief data, ultimately leading to more impactful recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>beeFormer: Bridging the Gap Between Semantic and Interaction Similarity in Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vojtěch Vančura, Milan Straka, Pavel Kordík</p>
    <p>Recommender systems often use text-side information to improve their predictions, especially in cold-start or zero-shot recommendation scenarios, where traditional collaborative filtering approaches cannot be used. Many approaches to text-mining side information for recommender systems have been proposed over recent years, with sentence Transformers being the most prominent one. However, these models are trained to predict semantic similarity without utilizing interaction data with hidden patterns specific to recommender systems. In this paper, we propose beeFormer, a framework for training sentence Transformer models with interaction data. We demonstrate that our models trained with beeFormer can transfer knowledge between datasets while outperforming not only semantic similarity sentence Transformers but also traditional collaborative filtering methods. We also show that training on multiple datasets from different domains accumulates knowledge in a single model, unlocking the possibility of training universal, domain-agnostic sentence Transformer models to mine text representations for recommender systems. We release the source code, trained models, and additional details allowing replication of our experiments at https://github.com/recombee/beeformer.</p>

    <h3>ReLand: Integrating Large Language Models’ Insights into Industrial Recommenders via a Controllable Reasoning Pool (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyu Chen, Changxin Tian, Jiawei Chen, Jun Zhou, Ziqi Liu, Li Yu, Chunjing Gan, Zhuo Zhang, Binbin Hu, Zhiqiang Zhang</p>
    <p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in addressing the isolation issues faced by recommender systems. However, despite performance comparable to traditional recommenders, the current methods are cost-prohibitive for industrial applications. Consequently, existing LLM-based methods still need to catch up regarding effectiveness and efficiency. To tackle the above challenges, we present an LLM-enhanced recommendation framework named ReLand, which leverages Retrieval to effortlessly integrate Large language models’ insights into industrial recommenders. Specifically, ReLand employs LLMs to perform generative recommendations on sampled users (a.k.a., seed users), thereby constructing an LLM Reasoning Pool. Subsequently, we leverage retrieval to attach reliable recommendation rationales for the entire user base, ultimately effectively improving recommendation performance. Extensive offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of ReLand. Since January 2024, ReLand has been deployed in the recommender system of Alipay, achieving statistically significant improvements of 3.19% in CTR and 1.08% in CVR.</p>

    <h3>A Multimodal Single-Branch Embedding Network for Recommendation in Cold-Start and Missing Modality Scenarios (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Hausberger, Markus Schedl, Christian Ganhör, Shah Nawaz, Marta Moscati</p>
    <p>Most recommender systems adopt collaborative filtering (CF) and provide recommendations based on past collective interactions. Therefore, the performance of CF algorithms degrades when few or no interactions are available, a scenario referred to as cold-start. To address this issue, previous work relies on models leveraging both collaborative data and side information on the users or items. Similar to multimodal learning, these models aim at combining collaborative and content representations in a shared embedding space. In this work we propose a novel technique for multimodal recommendation, relying on a multimodal Single-Branch embedding network for Recommendation (SiBraR). Leveraging weight-sharing, SiBraR encodes interaction data as well as multimodal side information using the same single-branch embedding network on different modalities. This makes SiBraR effective in scenarios of missing modality, including cold start. Our extensive experiments on large-scale recommendation datasets from three different recommendation domains (music, movie, and e-commerce) and providing multimodal content information (audio, text, image, labels, and interactions) show that SiBraR significantly outperforms CF as well as state-of-the-art content-based RSs in cold-start scenarios, and is competitive in warm scenarios. We show that SiBraR’s recommendations are accurate in missing modality scenarios, and that the model is able to map different modalities to the same region of the shared embedding space, hence reducing the modality gap.</p>

    <h3>The Role of Unknown Interactions in Implicit Matrix Factorization — A Probabilistic View (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bart Goethals, Joey De Pauw</p>
    <p>Matrix factorization is a well-known and effective methodology for top-k list recommendation. It became widely known during the Netflix challenge in 2006, and since then, many adapted and improved versions have been published. A particularly interesting matrix factorization algorithm called iALS (for implicit Alternating Least Squares) adapts the method for implicit feedback, i.e.\ a setting where only a very small amount of positive labels are available along with a majority of unknown labels. Compared to the classical task of rating prediction, learning from implicit feedback is applicable to many more domains, as the data is more abundant and requires less effort to elicit from users. However, the sparsity, imbalance, and implicit nature of the signal also pose unique challenges to retrieving the most relevant items to recommend. We revisit the role of unknown interactions in implicit matrix factorization. Traditionally, all unknowns are interpreted as negative samples and their importance in the training objective is then down-weighted to balance them out with the known, positive interactions. Interestingly, by adapting a probabilistic view of matrix factorization, we can retain the unknown nature of these interactions by modelling them as either positive or negative. With this new formulation that better fits the underlying data, we gain improved performance on the downstream recommendation task without any computational overhead compared to the popular iALS method. This paper outlines the key insights needed to adapt iALS to use logistic regression. Furthermore, the popular full-rank EASE model is identified as a special case of iALS. With this knowledge, EASE was trivially adapted to use logistic regression as well. An extensive experimental evaluation on several real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, a discrepancy between the need for weighting between factorization and regression models is discovered, leading towards a better understanding of these methods.</p>

    <h3>Unlocking the Hidden Treasures: Enhancing Recommendations with Unlabeled Data (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Chen, Li Chen, Hongtao Song, Yuhan Zhao, Qilong Han</p>
    <p>Collaborative filtering (CF) stands as a cornerstone in recommender systems, yet effectively leveraging the vast reservoir of unlabeled data presents a persistent challenge. Current research endeavors to address the challenge of unlabeled data by extracting a subset closely approximating negative samples. Regrettably, the remaining data are overlooked, failing to fully integrate this valuable information into the construction of user preferences. To address this gap, we introduce a novel positive-neutral-negative (PNN) learning paradigm. PNN introduces a neutral class, encompassing intricate items challenging to categorize directly as positive or negative samples. By training a model based on this triple-wise partial ranking, PNN offers a promising solution to learning complex user preferences. Through theoretical analysis, we connect PNN to one-way partial AUC (OPAUC) to validate its efficacy. Implementing the PNN paradigm is, however, technically challenging because: (1) it is difficult to classify unobserved items into neutral or negative in the absence of supervisory signals; (2) there does not exist any loss function that can handle set-level triple-wise ranking relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a semi-supervised learning method coupled with a user-aware attention model for knowledge acquisition and classification refinement. Additionally, a novel loss function and two-step centroid ranking approach enable handling set-level rankings. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that, when combined with PNN, a wide range of representative CF models can consistently and significantly boost their performance.

    <p>Privacy protection in recommendation systems is gaining increasing attention, for which federated learning has emerged as a promising solution. Current federated recommendation systems grapple with high communication overhead due to sharing dense global embeddings, and also poorly reflect user preferences due to data heterogeneity. To overcome these challenges, we propose a two-stage Federated Low-rank Coordinated Adaptation (FedLoCA) framework to decouple global and client-specific knowledge into low-rank embeddings, which significantly reduces communication overhead while enhancing the system’s ability to capture individual user preferences amidst data heterogeneity. Further, to tackle gradient estimation inaccuracies stemming from data sparsity in federated recommendation systems, we introduce an adversarial gradient projected descent approach in low-rank spaces, which significantly boosts model performance while maintaining robustness. Remarkably, FedLoCA also alleviates performance loss even under the stringent constraints of differential privacy. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that FedLoCA significantly outperforms existing methods in both recommendation accuracy and communication efficiency.</p>

    <h3>MARec: Metadata Alignment for cold-start Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anirban Majumder, Wentao Lu, Julien Monteil, Volodymyr Vaskovych, Anton van den Hengel</p>
    <p>For many recommender systems the primary data source is a historical record of user clicks. The associated click matrix which is often very sparse, however, as the number of users x products can be far larger than the number of clicks, and such sparsity is accentuated in cold-start settings. The sparsity of the click matrix is the reason matrix factorization and autoencoders techniques remain highly competitive across collaborative filtering datasets. In this work, we propose a simple approach to address cold-start recommendations by leveraging content metadata, Metadata Alignment for cold-start Recommendation (MARec). we show that this approach can readily augment existing matrix factorization and autoencoder approaches, enabling a smooth transition to top performing algorithms in warmer set-ups. Our experimental results indicate three separate contributions: first, we show that our proposed framework largely beats SOTA results on 4 cold-start datasets with different sparsity and scale characteristics, with gains ranging from +8.4% to +53.8% on reported ranking metrics; second, we provide an ablation study on the utility of semantic features, and proves the additional gain obtained by leveraging such features ranges between +46.8% and +105.5%; and third, our approach is by construction highly competitive in warm set-ups, and we propose a closed-form solution outperformed by SOTA results by only 0.8% on average.</p>
