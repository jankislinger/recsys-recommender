    <h3>Utilizing Non-click Samples via Semi-supervised Learning for Conversion Rate Prediction (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhao Wang, Dongbo Huang, Shanyang Jiang, Lan Zhang, Cheng Ding, Lan Xu, Jiahui Huang</p>
    <p>Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is essential in recommendation systems, facilitating precise matching between recommended items and users’ preferences. However, the sample selection bias (SSB) and data sparsity (DS) issues pose challenges to accurate prediction. Existing works have proposed the click-through and conversion rate (CTCVR) prediction task which models samples from exposure to “click and conversion” in entire space and incorporates multi-task learning. This approach has shown efficacy in mitigating these challenges. Nevertheless, it intensifies the false negative sample (FNS) problem. To be more specific, the CTCVR task implicitly treats all the CVR labels of non-click samples as negative, overlooking the possibility that some samples might convert if clicked. This oversight can negatively impact CVR model performance, as empirical analysis has confirmed. To this end, we advocate for discarding the CTCVR task and proposing a Non-click samples Improved Semi-supErvised (NISE) method for conversion rate prediction, where the non-click samples are treated as unlabeled. Our approach aims to predict their probabilities of conversion if clicked, utilizing these predictions as pseudo-labels for further model training. This strategy can help alleviate the FNS problem, and direct modeling of the CVR task across the entire space also mitigates the SSB and DS challenges. Additionally, we conduct multi-task learning by introducing an auxiliary click-through rate prediction task, thereby enhancing embedding layer representations. Our approach is applicable to various multi-task architectures. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both public and production datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed method in mitigating the FNS challenge and improving the CVR estimation.</p>

    <h3>STAN: Stage-Adaptive Network for Multi-Task Recommendation by Learning User Lifecycle-Based Representation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenhao Zheng, Suhang Wang, Xuanji Xiao, Wanda Li</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems play a vital role in many online platforms, with their primary objective being to satisfy and retain users. As directly optimizing user retention is challenging, multiple evaluation metrics are often employed. Existing methods generally formulate the optimization of these evaluation metrics as a multi-task learning problem, but often overlook the fact that user preferences for different tasks are personalized and change over time. Identifying and tracking the evolution of user preferences can lead to better user retention. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of “user lifecycle,” consisting of multiple stages characterized by users’ varying preferences for different tasks. We propose a novel <b>St</b>age-<b>A</b>daptive <b>N</b>etwork (<b>STAN</b>) framework for modeling user lifecycle stages. STAN first identifies latent user lifecycle stages based on learned user preferences, and then employs the stage representation to enhance multi-task learning performance. Our experimental results using both public and industrial datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves multi-task prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the importance of considering user lifecycle stages in recommendation systems. Furthermore, online A/B testing reveals that our model outperforms the existing model, achieving a significant improvement of 3.05\% in staytime per user and 0.88\% in CVR. These results indicate that our approach effectively improves the overall efficiency of the multi-task recommendation system.</p>

    <h3>Leveling Up the Peloton Homescreen: A System and Algorithm for Dynamic Row Ranking (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Natalia Chen, Alexey Zankevich, Nganba Meetei, Nilothpal Talukder</p>
    <p>At Peloton, we constantly strive to improve the member experience by highlighting personalized content that speaks to each individual user. One area of focus is our landing page, the homescreen, consisting of numerous rows of class recommendations used to captivate our users and guide them through our growing catalog of workouts. In this paper, we discuss a strategy we have used to increase the rate of workouts started from our homescreen through a Thompson sampling approach to row ranking, enhanced further with a collaborative filtering method based on user similarity calculated from workout history.</p>

    <h3>Gradient Matching for Categorical Data Distillation in CTR Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixuan Li, Zhenhua Dong, Jiacheng Sun, Cheng Wang, Rui Zhang</p>
    <p>The cost of hardware and energy consumption on training a click-through rate (CTR) model is highly prohibitive. A recent promising direction for reducing such costs is data distillation with gradient matching, which aims to synthesize a small distilled dataset to guide the model to a similar parameter space as those trained on real data. However, there are two main challenges to implementing such a method in the recommendation field: (1) The categorical recommended data are high dimensional and sparse one- or multi-hot data which will block the gradient flow, causing backpropagation-based data distillation invalid. (2) The data distillation process with gradient matching is computationally expensive due to the bi-level optimization. To this end, we investigate efficient data distillation tailored for recommendation data with plenty of side information where we formulate the discrete data to the dense and continuous data format. Then, we further introduce a one-step gradient matching scheme, which performs gradient matching for only a single step to overcome the inefficient training process. The overall proposed method is called Categorical data distillation with Gradient Matching (CGM), which is capable of distilling a large dataset into a small of informative synthetic data for training CTR models from scratch. Experimental results show that our proposed method not only outperforms the state-of-the-art coreset selection and data distillation methods but also has remarkable cross-architecture performance. Moreover, we explore the application of CGM on continual updating and mitigate the effect of different random seeds on the training results.</p>

    <h3>Recommending the Video to Watch Next: An Offline and Online Evaluation at YOUTV.de (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Zanker, Daniel Morandini, Ludovik Coba, Panagiotis Symeonidis, Andrea Janes, Dmitry Chaltsev, Andreas Unterhuber, Philip Giuliani</p>
    <p>The task “recommend a video to watch next?” has been in the focus of recommender systems’ research for a long time. However, adequately exploiting the clues hidden in the sequences of actions of user sessions in order to reveal users’ short-term intentions moved only recently into the focus of research. Based on a real-world application scenario, in this paper, we propose a Markov Chain-based transition probability matrix to efficiently reveal the short-term preferences of individuals. We experimentally evaluated our proposed method by comparing it against state-of-the-art algorithms in an offline as well as a live evaluation setting. In both cases our method not only demonstrated its superiority over its competitors, but exposed a clearly stronger engagement of users on the platform. In the online setting, our method improved the click-through rate by up to 93.61%. This paper therefore contributes real-world evidence for improving the recommendation effectiveness, by considering sequence-awareness, since capturing the short-term preferences of users is crucial in the light of items with a short life span such as tv programs (news, tv shows, etc.).</p>

    <h3>Should we Embed? A Study on the Online Performance of Utilizing Embeddings for Real-Time Job Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elisabeth Lex, Emanuel Lacic, Valentin Slawicek, Markus Reiter-Haas, Tomislav Duricic</p>
    <p>In this work, we present the findings of an online study, where we explore the impact of utilizing embeddings to recommend job postings under real-time constraints. On the Austrian job platform Studo Jobs, we evaluate two popular recommendation scenarios: (i) providing similar jobs and, (ii) personalizing the job postings that are shown on the homepage. Our results show that for recommending similar jobs, we achieve the best online performance in terms of Click-Through Rate when we employ embeddings based on the most recent interaction. To personalize the job postings shown on a user’s homepage, however, combining embeddings based on the frequency and recency with which a user interacts with job postings results in the best online performance. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Ensemble Contextual Bandits for Personalized Recommendation (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Li, Lei Li, Yexi Jiang, Liang Tang</p>
    <p>The cold-start problem has attracted extensive attention among various online services that provide personalized recommendation. Many online vendors employ contextual bandit strategies to tackle the so-called exploration/exploitation dilemma rooted from the cold-start problem. However, due to high-dimensional user/item features and the underlying characteristics of bandit policies, it is often difficult for service providers to obtain and deploy an appropriate algorithm to achieve acceptable and robust economic profit. In this paper, we explore ensemble strategies of multiple contextual bandit algorithms to obtain robust predicted click-through rate (CTR) of web objects. Specifically, the ensemble is acquired by aggregating different pulling policies of bandit algorithms, rather than forcing the agreement of prediction results or learning a unified predictive model. To this end, we employ a meta-bandit paradigm that places a hyper bandit over the base bandits, to explicitly explore/exploit the relative importance of base bandits based on user feedbacks. Extensive empirical experiments on two real-world data sets (news recommendation and online advertising) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of CTR.</p>
