    <h3>Overcoming Recommendation Limitations with Neuro-Symbolic Integration (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tommaso Carraro</p>
    <p>Despite being studied for over twenty years, Recommender Systems (RSs) still suffer from important issues that limit their applicability in real-world scenarios. Data sparsity, cold start, and explainability are some of the most impacting problems. Intuitively, these historical limitations can be mitigated by injecting prior knowledge into recommendation models. Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) approaches are suitable candidates for achieving this goal. Specifically, they aim to integrate learning (e.g., neural networks) with symbolic reasoning (e.g., logical reasoning). Generally, the integration lets a neural model interact with a logical knowledge base, enabling reasoning capabilities. In particular, NeSy approaches have been shown to deal well with poor training data, and their symbolic component could enhance model transparency. This gives insights that NeSy systems could potentially mitigate the aforementioned RSs limitations. However, the application of such systems to RSs is still in its early stages, and most of the proposed architectures do not really exploit the advantages of a NeSy approach. To this end, we conducted preliminary experiments with a Logic Tensor Network (LTN), a novel NeSy framework. We used the LTN to train a vanilla Matrix Factorization model using a First-Order Logic knowledge base as an objective. In particular, we encoded facts to enable the regularization of the latent factors using content information, obtaining promising results. In this paper, we review existing NeSy recommenders, argue about their limitations, show our preliminary results with the LTN, and propose interesting future works in this novel research area. In particular, we show how the LTN can be intuitively used to regularize models, perform cross-domain recommendation, ensemble learning, and explainable recommendation, reduce popularity bias, and easily define the loss function of a model.</p>

    <h3>Countering Popularity Bias by Regularizing Score Differences (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sung Min Cho, Wondo Rhee, Bongwon Suh</p>
    <p>Recommendation system often suffers from popularity bias. Often the training data inherently exhibits long-tail distribution in item popularity (data bias). Moreover, the recommendation systems could give unfairly higher recommendation scores to popular items even among items a user equally liked, resulting in over-recommendation of popular items (model bias). In this study we propose a novel method to reduce the model bias while maintaining accuracy by directly regularizing the recommendation scores to be equal across items a user preferred. Akin to contrastive learning, we extend the widely used pairwise loss (BPR loss) which maximizes the score differences between preferred and unpreferred items, with a regularization term that minimizes the score differences within preferred and unpreferred items, respectively, thereby achieving both high debias and high accuracy performance with no additional training. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, we design an experiment using a synthetic dataset which induces model bias with baseline training; we showed applying the proposed method resulted in drastic reduction of model bias while maintaining accuracy. Comprehensive comparison with earlier debias methods showed the proposed method had advantages in terms of computational validity and efficiency. Further empirical experiments utilizing four benchmark datasets and four recommendation models indicated the proposed method showed general improvements over performances of earlier debias methods. We hope that our method could help users enjoy diverse recommendations promoting serendipitous findings. Code available at https://github.com/stillpsy/popbias.</p>

    <h3>Controlling Popularity Bias in Learning-to-Rank Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bamshad Mobasher, Himan Abdollahpouri, Robin Burke</p>
    <p>Many recommendation algorithms suffer from popularity bias in their output: popular items are recommended frequently and less popular ones rarely, if at all. However, less popular, long-tail items are precisely those that are desirable for increased user satisfaction. In this paper, we introduce a flexible regularization-based framework to enhance the longtail coverage of recommendation lists in a learning-to-rank algorithm. We show that regularization provides a tunable mechanism for controlling the trade-off between accuracy and coverage. Moreover, the experimental results using two data sets show that it is possible to achieve higher coverage of long tail items without substantial sacrifice of ranking performance.</p>

    <h3>Learning Distributed Representations from Reviews for Collaborative Filtering (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aaron Courville, Kyle Kastner, Amjad Almahairi, Kyunghyun Cho</p>
    <p>Recent work has shown that collaborative filter-based recommender systems can be improved by incorporating side information, such as natural language reviews, as a way of regularizing the derived product representations. Motivated by the success of this approach, we introduce two different models of reviews and study their effect on collaborative filtering performance. While the previous state-of-the-art approach is based on a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model of reviews, the models we explore are neural network based: a bag-of-words product-of-experts model and a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that the increased flexibility offered by the product-of-experts model allowed it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Amazon review dataset, outperforming the LDA-based approach. However, interestingly, the greater modeling power offered by the recurrent neural network appears to undermine the modelâ€™s ability to act as a regularizer of the product representations.</p>

    <h3>Overlapping Community Regularization for Rating Prediction in Social Recommender Systems (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dingming Wu, Nikos Mamoulis, Wenbin Tang, Hui Li</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have become de facto tools for suggesting items that are of potential interest to users. Predicting a userâ€™s rating on an item is the fundamental recommendation task. Traditional methods that generate predictions by analyzing the user-item rating matrix perform poorly when the matrix is sparse. Recent approaches use data from social networks to improve accuracy. However, most of the social-network based recommender systems only consider direct friendships and they are less effective when the targeted user has few social connections. In this paper, we propose two alternative models that incorporate the overlapping community regularization into the matrix factorization framework. Our empirical study on four real datasets shows that our approaches outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in both traditional and social-network based recommender systems regarding both cold-start users and normal users.</p>
