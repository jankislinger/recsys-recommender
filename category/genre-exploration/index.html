    <h3>Exploring the longitudinal effect of nudging on users’ genre exploration behavior and listening preference (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martijn C. Willemsen, Yu Liang</p>
    <p>Previous studies on exploration have shown that users can be nudged to explore further away from their current preferences. However, these effects were shown in a single session study, while it often takes time to explore new tastes and develop new preferences. In this work, we present a longitudinal study on users’ exploration behavior and behavior change over time after they have used a music genre exploration tool for four sessions in six weeks. We test two relevant nudges to help them explore more: the starting point (the personalization of the default initial playlist) and the visualization of users’ previous position(s). Our results show that the personalization level of the default initial playlist in the first session influences the preferred personalization level users set in the second session but fades away in later sessions as users start exploring in different directions. Visualization of users’ previous positions did not anchor users to stay closer to the initial defaults. Over time, users perceived the playlist to be more personalized to their tastes and helpful to explore the genre. Perceived helpfulness increased more when users explored further away from their current preferences. Apart from differences in self-reported measures, we also find some objective evidence for preference change in users’ top tracks from their Spotify profile, that over the period of 6 weeks moved somewhat closer to the genre that users selected to explore with the tool.</p>

    <h3>The role of preference consistency, defaults and musical expertise in users’ exploration behavior in a genre exploration recommender (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Liang, Martijn C. Willemsen</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are efficient at predicting users’ current preferences, but how users’ preferences develop over time is still under-explored. In this work, we study the development of users’ musical preferences. Exploring musical preference consistency between short-term and long-term preferences in data from earlier studies, we find that users with higher musical expertise have more consistent preferences at their top-listened artists and tags than those with lower musical expertise. Users typically chose to explore genres that were close to their current preferences, and this effect was stronger for expert users. Based on these findings we conducted a user study on genre exploration to investigate (1) whether it is possible to nudge users to explore more distant genres, and (2) how users’ exploration behaviors within a genre are influenced by default recommendation settings that balance personalization with genre representativeness in different ways. Our results show that users were more likely to select the more distant genres if these were presented at the top of the list. However, users with high musical expertise were less likely to do so, consistent with our earlier findings. When given a representative or mixed (balanced) default for exploration within a genre, users selected less personalized recommendation settings and explored further away from their current preferences, than with a personalized default. However, this effect was moderated by users’ slider usage behaviors. Overall, our results suggest that (personalized) defaults can nudge users to explore new, more distant genres and songs. However, the effect is smaller for those with higher musical expertise levels.</p>
