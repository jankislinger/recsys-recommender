    <h3>Disentangling Motives behind Item Consumption and Social Connection for Mutually-enhanced Joint Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yew Soon Ong, Jie Zhang, Zhu Sun, Youchen Sun, Xiao Sha</p>
    <p>Item consumption and social connection, as common user behaviors in many web applications, have been extensively studied. However, most current works separately perform either item or social link prediction tasks, possibly with the help of the other as an auxiliary signal. Moreover, they merely consider the behaviors in a holistic manner yet neglect the multi-faceted motives behind them (e.g., watching movies to kill time or with friends; connecting with others due to friendships or colleagues). To fill the gap, we propose to disentangle the multi-faceted motives in each network, defined respectively by the two types of behaviors, for mutually- enhanced joint prediction (DMJP). Specifically, we first learn the disentangled user representations driven by motives of multi-facets in both networks. Thereafter, the mutual influence of the two networks is subtly discriminated at the facet-to-facet level. The fine-grained mutual influence, proven to be asymmetric, is then exploited to help refine user representations in both networks, with the goal of achieving a mutually-enhanced joint item and social link prediction. Empirical studies on three public datasets showcase the superiority of DMJP against state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on both tasks.</p>

    <h3>Revisiting the Performance of iALS on Item Recommendation Benchmarks (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yehuda Koren, Walid Krichene, Steffen Rendle, Li Zhang</p>
    <p>Matrix factorization learned by implicit alternating least squares (iALS) is a popular baseline in recommender system research publications. iALS is known to be one of the most computationally efficient and scalable collaborative filtering methods. However, recent studies suggest that its prediction quality is not competitive with the current state of the art, in particular autoencoders and other item-based collaborative filtering methods. In this work, we revisit four well-studied benchmarks where iALS was reported to perform poorly and show that with proper tuning, iALS is highly competitive and outperforms any method on at least half of the comparisons. We hope that these high quality results together with iALS’s known scalability spark new interest in applying and further improving this decade old technique.</p>

    <h3>Data Mining for Item Recommendation in MOBA Games (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Parra, Felipe Rios, Vladimir Araujo</p>
    <p>E-Sports has been positioned as an important activity within  MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) games in recent years. There is existing research on recommender systems in this topic, but most of it focuses on the character recommendation problem. However, the recommendation of items is also challenging because of its contextual nature, depending on the other characters. We have developed a framework that suggests items for a character based on the match context. The system aims to help players who have recently started the game as well as frequent players to take strategic advantage during a match and to improve their purchasing decision making. By analyzing a dataset of ranked matches through data mining techniques, we can capture purchase dynamic of experienced players to use it to generate recommendations. The results show that our proposed solution yields up to 80% of mAP, suggesting that the method leverages context information successfully. These results, together with open issues we mention in the paper, call for further research in the area. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Case Recommender: A Flexible and Extensible Python Framework for Recommender Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcelo Manzato, Fernando Soares De Aguiar Neto, Arthur Fortes Da Costa, Eduardo Pereira Fressato, Ricardo José Gabrielli Barreto Campello</p>
    <p>This paper presents a polished open-source Python-based recommender framework named Case Recommender, which provides a rich set of components from which developers can construct and evaluate customized recommender systems. It implements well-known and state-of-the-art algorithms in rating prediction and item recommendation scenarios. The main advantage of the Case Recommender is the possibility to integrate clustering and ensemble algorithms with recommendation engines, easing the development of more accurate and efficient approaches.</p>
