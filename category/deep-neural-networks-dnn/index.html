    <h3>A Joint Dynamic Ranking System with DNN and Vector-based Clustering Bandit (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changping Peng, Jincheng Wang, Xiaoxiao Xu, Weipeng Yan, Yong Li, Yongjun Bao, Yu Liu</p>
    <p>The ad-ranking module is the core of the advertising recommender system. Existing ad-ranking modules are mainly based on the deep neural network click-through rate prediction model. Recently an innovative ad-ranking paradigm called DNN-MAB has been introduced to address DNN-only paradigmsâ€™ weakness in perceiving highly dynamic user intent over time. We introduce the DNN-MAB paradigm into our ad-ranking system to alleviate the Matthew effect that harms the user experience. Due to data sparsity, however, the actual performance of DNN-MAB is lower than expected. In this paper, we propose an innovative ad-ranking paradigm called DNN-VMAB to solve these problems. Based on vectorization and clustering, it utilizes latent collaborative information in user behavior data to find a set of ads with higher relativity and diversity. As an integration of the essences of classical collaborative filtering, deep click-through rate prediction model, and contextual multi-armed bandit, it can improve platform revenue and user experience. Both offline and online experiments show the advantage of our new algorithm over DNN-MAB and some other existing algorithms.</p>

    <h3>FiBiNET: Combining Feature Importance and Bilinear feature Interaction for Click-Through Rate Prediction (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiqi Zhang, Junlin Zhang, Tongwen Huang</p>
    <p>Advertising and feed ranking are essential to many Internet companies such as Facebook and Sina Weibo. Among many real-world advertising and feed ranking systems, click through rate (CTR) prediction plays a central role. There are many proposed models in this field such as logistic regression, tree based models, factorization machine based models and deep learning based CTR models. However, many current works calculate the feature interactions in a simple way such as Hadamard product and inner product and they care less about the importance of features. In this paper, a new model named FiBiNET as an abbreviation for Feature Importance and Bilinear feature Interaction NETwork is proposed to dynamically learn the feature importance and fine-grained feature interactions. On the one hand, the FiBiNET can dynamically learn the importance of features via the Squeeze-Excitation network (SENET) mechanism. On the other hand, it is able to effectively learn the feature interactions via bilinear function. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and show that our shallow model outperforms other shallow models such as factorization machine(FM) and field-aware factorization machine(FFM). In order to improve performance further, we combine a classical deep neural network(DNN) component with the shallow model to be a deep model. The deep FiBiNET consistently outperforms the other state-of-the-art deep models such as DeepFM and extreme deep factorization machine(XdeepFM).</p>
