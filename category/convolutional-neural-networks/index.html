    <h3>Interpretable Convolutional Neural Networks with Dual Local and Global Attention for Review Rating Prediction (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing Huang, Sungyong Seo, Hao Yang, Yan Liu</p>
    <p>Recently, many e-commerce websites have encouraged their users to rate shopping items and write review text. This review text information has been very useful for understanding user preferences and item properties and it enhances the capability to make personalized recommendations of these websites. In this paper, we propose to model user preferences and item properties using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with dual local and global attention, motivated by the superiority of CNNs to extract complex features. By using aggregated review text from a user and aggregated review text for an item, our model can learn the unique features (embedding) of each user and each item. These features are then used to predict ratings. We train these user and item networks jointly and this enables the interaction between users and items in a similar way to matrix factorization. The local attention gives us insight on a user’s preferences or an item’s properties. The global attention helps CNNs focus on semantic meanings of the whole review text. Thus, the combined local and global attentions enable an interpretable and better-learned representation of users and items. We validate the proposed models by applying popular review datasets in Yelp and Amazon and compare the results with matrix factorization (MF), the hidden factors as topics (HFT) model, and the recently proposed convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF+). The proposed CNNs with dual attention model outperforms HFT and ConvMF+ in terms of mean square errors (MSE). In addition, we compare the user/item embeddings learned from these models for classification and recommendation. These results also confirm the superior quality of user/item embeddings learned from our model.</p>

    <h3>Convolutional Matrix Factorization for Document Context-Aware Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hwanjo Yu, Sungyong Lee, Jinoh Oh, Chanyoung Park, Donghyun Kim</p>
    <p>Sparseness of user-to-item rating data is one of the major factors that deteriorate the quality of recommender system. To handle the sparsity problem, several recommendation techniques have been proposed that additionally consider auxiliary information to improve rating prediction accuracy. In particular, when rating data is sparse, document modeling-based approaches have improved the accuracy by additionally utilizing textual data such as reviews, abstracts, or synopses. However, due to the inherent limitation of the bag-of-words model, they have difficulties in effectively utilizing contextual information of the documents, which leads to shallow understanding of the documents. This paper proposes a novel context-aware recommendation model, convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF) that integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) into probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF). Consequently, ConvMF captures contextual information of documents and further enhances the rating prediction accuracy. Our extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets show that ConvMF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation models even when the rating data is extremely sparse. We also demonstrate that ConvMF successfully captures subtle contextual difference of a word in a document. Our implementation and datasets are available at http://dm.postech.ac.kr/ConvMF.</p>
