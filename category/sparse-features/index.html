    <h3>TorchRec: a PyTorch domain library for recommendation systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dennis Van Der Staay, Colin Taylor, Xing Liu, Rahul Kindi, Anirudh Sudarshan, Shahin Sefati, Will Feng, Dmytro Ivchenko</p>
    <p>Recommendation Systems (RecSys) comprise a large footprint of production-deployed AI today. The neural network-based recommender systems differ from deep learning models in other domains in using high-cardinality categorical sparse features that require large embedding tables to be trained. In this talk we introduce TorchRec, a PyTorch domain library for Recommendation Systems. This new library provides common sparsity and parallelism primitives, enabling researchers to build state-of-the-art personalization models and deploy them in production. In this talk we cover the building blocks of the TorchRec library including modeling primitives such as embedding bags and jagged tensors, optimized recommender system kernels powered by FBGEMM, a flexible sharder that supports a veriety of strategies for partitioning embedding tables, a planner that automatically generates optimized and performant sharding plans, support for GPU inference and common modeling modules for building recommender system models. TorchRec library is currently used to train large-scale recommender models at Meta. We will present how TorchRec helped Metaâ€™s recommender system platform to transition from CPU asynchronous training to accelerator-based full-sync training.</p>

    <h3>Model Size Reduction Using Frequency Based Double Hashing for Recommender Systems (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pranay Kumar Myana, Caojin Zhang, Alykhan Tejani, Akshay Gupta, Deepak Dilipkumar, Ferenc Huszar, Sofia Ira Ira Ktena, Ikuhiro Ihara, Prasang Upadhyaya, Wenzhe Shi, Yuanpu Xie, Suvadip Paul, Yicun Liu</p>
    <p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with sparse input features have been widely used in recommender systems in industry. These models have large memory requirements and need a huge amount of training data. The large model size usually entails a cost, in the range of millions of dollars, for storage and communication with the inference services. In this paper, we propose a hybrid hashing method to combine frequency hashing and double hashing techniques for model size reduction, without compromising performance. We evaluate the proposed models on two product surfaces. In both cases, experiment results demonstrated that we can reduce the model size by around 90 while keeping the performance on par with the original baselines.</p>
