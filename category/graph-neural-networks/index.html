    <h3>A Novel Evaluation Perspective on GNNs-based Recommender Systems through the Topology of the User-Item Graph (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Carlo Maria Mancino, Vito Walter Anelli, Claudio Pomo, Tommaso Di Noia, Eugenio Di Sciascio, Daniele Malitesta</p>
    <p>Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs)-based recommender systems have encountered great success in recommendation. As the number of GNNs approaches rises, some works have started questioning the theoretical and empirical reasons behind their superior performance. Nevertheless, this investigation still disregards that GNNs treat the recommendation data as a topological graph structure. Building on this assumption, in this work, we provide a novel evaluation perspective on GNNs-based recommendation, which investigates the impact of the graph topology on the recommendation performance. To this end, we select some (topological) properties of the recommendation data and three GNNs-based recommender systems (i.e., LightGCN, DGCF, and SVD-GCN). Then, starting from three popular recommendation datasets (i.e., Yelp2018, Gowalla, and Amazon-Book) we sample them to obtain 1,800 size-reduced datasets that still resemble the original ones but can encompass a wider range of topological structures. We use this procedure to build a large pool of samples for which data characteristics and recommendation performance of the selected GNNs models are measured. Through an explanatory framework, we find strong correspondences between graph topology and GNNs performance, offering a novel evaluation perspective on these models.</p>

    <h3>A Unified Graph Transformer for Overcoming Isolations in Multi-modal Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixuan Yi, Iadh Ounis</p>
    <p>With the rapid development of online multimedia services, especially in e-commerce platforms, there is a pressing need for personalised recommendation systems that can effectively encode the diverse multi-modal content associated with each item. However, we argue that existing multi-modal recommender systems typically use isolated processes for both feature extraction and modality modelling. Such isolated processes can harm the recommendation performance. Firstly, an isolated extraction process underestimates the importance of effective feature extraction in multi-modal recommendations, potentially incorporating non-relevant information, which is harmful to item representations. Second, an isolated modality modelling process produces disjointed embeddings for item modalities due to the individual processing of each modality, which leads to a suboptimal fusion of user/item representations for effective user preferences prediction. We hypothesise that the use of a unified model for addressing both aforementioned isolated processes will enable the consistent extraction and cohesive fusion of joint multi-modal features, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of multi-modal recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called Unified Multi-modal Graph Transformer (UGT), which firstly leverages a multi-way transformer to extract aligned multi-modal features from raw data for top-k recommendation. Subsequently, we build a unified graph neural network in our UGT model to jointly fuse the user/item representations with their corresponding multi-modal features. Using the graph transformer architecture of our UGT model, we show that the UGT model can achieve significant effectiveness gains, especially when jointly optimised with the commonly-used multi-modal recommendation losses. Our extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed UGT model over seven existing state-of-the-art recommendation approaches.</p>

    <h3>LightSAGE: Graph Neural Networks for Large Scale Item Retrieval in Shopee’s Advertisement Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Zeng, Chenfei Wang, Yan Shen, Dang Minh Nguyen</p>
    <p>Graph Neural Network (GNN) is the trending solution for item retrieval in recommendation problems. Most recent reports, however, focus heavily on new model architectures. This may bring some gaps when applying GNN in the industrial setup, where, besides the model, constructing graph and handling data sparsity also play critical roles in the overall success of the project. In this work, we report how we apply GNN for large-scale e-commerce item retrieval at Shopee. We detail our simple yet novel and impactful techniques in graph construction, modeling, and handling data skewness. Specifically, we construct high-quality item graphs by combining strong-signal user behaviors with high-precision collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm. We then develop a new GNN architecture named LightSAGE to produce high-quality items’ embeddings for vector search. Finally, we develop multiple strategies to handle cold-start and long-tail items, which are critical in an advertisement (ads) system. Our models bring improvement in offline evaluations, online A/B tests, and are deployed to the main traffic of Shopee’s Recommendation Advertisement system.</p>

    <h3>User-Centric Conversational Recommendation: Adapting the Need of User with Large Language Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gangyi Zhang</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) promise to provide a more natural user experience for exploring and discovering items of interest through ongoing conversation. However, effectively modeling user preferences during conversations and generating personalized recommendations in real time remain challenging problems. Users often express their needs in a vague and evolving manner, and CRS must adapt to capture the dynamics and uncertainty in user preferences to have productive interactions. This research develops user-centric methods for building conversational recommendation system that can understand complex and changing user needs. We propose a graph-based conversational recommendation framework that represents multi-turn conversations as reasoning over a user-item-attribute graph. Enhanced conversational path reasoning incorporates graph neural networks to improve representation learning in this framework. To address uncertainty and dynamics in user preferences, we present the vague preference multi-round conversational recommendation scenario and an adaptive vague preference policy learning solution that employs reinforcement learning to determine recommendation and preference elicitation strategies tailored to the user. Looking to the future, large language models offer promising opportunities to enhance various aspects of CRS, including user modeling, policy learning, response generation.  Overall, this research takes a user-centered perspective in designing conversational agents that can adapt to the inherent ambiguity involved in natural language dialogues with people.</p>

    <h3>SPARE: Shortest Path Global Item Relations for Efficient Session-based Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Peintner, Eva Zangerle, Amir Reza Mohammadi</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendation aims to predict the next item based on a set of anonymous sessions. Capturing user intent from a short interaction sequence imposes a variety of challenges since no user profiles are available and interaction data is naturally sparse. Recent approaches relying on graph neural networks (GNNs) for session-based recommendation use global item relations to explore collaborative information from different sessions. These methods capture the topological structure of the graph and rely on multi-hop information aggregation in GNNs to exchange information along edges. Consequently, graph-based models suffer from noisy item relations in the training data and introduce high complexity for large item catalogs. We propose to explicitly model the multi-hop information aggregation mechanism over multiple layers via shortest-path edges based on knowledge from the sequential recommendation domain. Our approach does not require multiple layers to exchange information and ignores unreliable item-item relations. Furthermore, to address inherent data sparsity, we are the first to apply supervised contrastive learning by mining data-driven positive and hard negative item samples from the training data. Extensive experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms almost all of the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>Going Beyond Local: Global Graph-Enhanced Personalized News Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irene Li, Ruihai Dong, Dairui Liu, Toyotaro Suzumura, Boming Yang</p>
    <p>Precisely recommending candidate news articles to users has always been a core challenge for personalized news recommendation systems. Most recent work primarily focuses on using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract semantic information from rich textual data, employing content-based methods derived from locally viewed historical clicked news. However, this approach lacks a global perspective, failing to account for users’ hidden motivations and behaviors beyond semantic information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model called GLORY(Global-LOcal news Recommendation sYstem), which combines global news representations learned from other users with local news representations to enhance personalized recommendation systems. We accomplish this by constructing a Global Clicked News Encoder, which includes a global news graph and employs gated graph neural networks to fuse news representations, thereby enriching clicked news representations. Similarly, we extend this approach to a Global Candidate News Encoder, utilizing a global entity graph and candidate news fusion to enhance candidate news representation. Evaluation results on two public news datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Furthermore, our model offers more diverse recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Uncertainty-adjusted Inductive Matrix Completion with Graph Neural Networks (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Ledent, Petr Kasalicky, Rodrigo Alves</p>
    <p>We propose a robust recommender systems model which performs matrix completion and a ratings-wise uncertainty estimation jointly. Whilst the prediction module is purely based on an implicit low-rank assumption imposed via nuclear norm regularization, our loss function is augmented by an uncertainty estimation module which learns an anomaly score for each individual rating via a Graph Neural Network: data points deemed more anomalous by the GNN are downregulated in the loss function used to train the low-rank module. The whole model is trained in an end-to-end fashion, allowing the anomaly detection module to tap on the supervised information available in the form of ratings. Thus, our model’s predictors enjoy the favourable generalization properties that come with being chosen from small function space (i.e., low-rank matrices), whilst exhibiting the robustness to outliers and flexibility that comes with deep learning methods. Furthermore, the anomaly scores themselves contain valuable qualitative information. Experiments on various real-life datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms standard matrix completion and other baselines, confirming the usefulness of the anomaly detection module.</p>

    <h3>KGTORe: Tailored Recommendations through Knowledge-aware GNN Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salvatore Bufi, Eugenio Di Sciascio, Tommaso Di Noia, Daniele Malitesta, Antonio Ferrara, Alberto Carlo Maria Mancino</p>
    <p>Knowledge graphs (KG) have been proven to be a powerful source of side information to enhance the performance of recommendation algorithms. Their graph-based structure paves the way for the adoption of graph-aware learning models such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this respect, state-of-the-art models achieve good performance and interpretability via user-level combinations of intents leading users to their choices. Unfortunately, such results often come from and end-to-end learnings that considers a combination of the whole set of features contained in the KG without any analysis of the user decisions. In this paper, we introduce KGTORe, a GNN-based model that exploits KG to learn latent representations for the semantic features, and consequently, interpret the user decisions as a personal distillation of the item feature representations. Differently from previous models, KGTORe does not need to process the whole KG at training time but relies on a selection of the most discriminative features for the users, thus resulting in improved performance and personalization. Experimental results on three well-known datasets show that KGTORe achieves remarkable accuracy performance and several ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of its components.</p>

    <h3>Multi-task Item-attribute Graph Pre-training for Strict Cold-start Item Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Peng, Zhiwei Liu, Chenyu You, Philip Yu, Liangwei Yang, Chen Wang, Yuwei Cao</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems suffer in the strict cold-start (SCS) scenario, where the user-item interactions are entirely unavailable. The well-established, dominating identity (ID)-based approaches completely fail to work. Cold-start recommenders, on the other hand, leverage item contents (brand, title, descriptions, etc.) to map the new items to the existing ones. However, the existing SCS recommenders explore item contents in coarse-grained manners that introduce noise or information loss. Moreover, informative data sources other than item contents, such as users’ purchase sequences and review texts, are largely ignored. In this work, we explore the role of the fine-grained item attributes in bridging the gaps between the existing and the SCS items and pre-train a knowledgeable item-attribute graph for SCS item recommendation. Our proposed framework, ColdGPT, models item-attribute correlations into an item-attribute graph by extracting fine-grained attributes from item contents. ColdGPT then transfers knowledge into the item-attribute graph from various available data sources, i.e., item contents, historical purchase sequences, and review texts of the existing items, via multi-task learning. To facilitate the positive transfer, ColdGPT designs specific submodules according to the natural forms of the data sources and proposes to coordinate the multiple pre-training tasks via unified alignment-and-uniformity losses. Our pre-trained item-attribute graph acts as an implicit, extendable item embedding matrix, which enables the SCS item embeddings to be easily acquired by inserting these items into the item-attribute graph and propagating their attributes’ embeddings. We carefully process three public datasets, i.e., Yelp, Amazon-home, and Amazon-sports, to guarantee the SCS setting for evaluation. Extensive experiments show that ColdGPT consistently outperforms the existing SCS recommenders by large margins and even surpasses models that are pre-trained on 75 – 224 times more, cross-domain data on two out of four datasets. Our code and pre-processed datasets for SCS evaluations are publicly available to help future SCS studies.</p>

    <h3>Challenging the Myth of Graph Collaborative Filtering: a Reasoned and Reproducibility-driven Analysis (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Pomo, Eugenio Di Sciascio, Daniele Malitesta, Tommaso Di Noia, Vito Walter Anelli, Alejandro Bellogin</p>
    <p>Among the most successful research directions in recommender systems, there are undoubtedly graph neural network-based models (GNNs). Through the natural modeling of users and items as a bipartite, undirected graph, GNNs have pushed up the performance bar for modern recommenders. Unfortunately, most of the original graph-based works cherry-pick results from previous baseline papers without bothering to check whether the results are valid for the configuration under analysis. Thus, our work stands first and foremost as a work on the replicability of results. We provide a code that succeeds in replicating the results proposed in the articles introducing six of the most popular and recent graph recommendation models (i.e., NGCF, DGCF, LightGCN, SGL, UltraGCN, and GFCF). In our experimental setup, we test these six models on three common benchmarking datasets (i.e., Gowalla, Yelp 2018, and Amazon Book). In addition, to understand how these models perform with respect to traditional models for collaborative filtering, we compare the graph models under analysis with some models that have historically emerged as the best performers in an offline evaluation context. Then, the study is extended on two new datasets (i.e., Allrecipes and BookCrossing) for which no known setup exists in the literature. Since the performance on such datasets is not entirely aligned with the previous benchmarking one, we further analyze the possible impact of specific dataset characteristics on the recommendation accuracy performance. By investigating the information flow to the users from their neighborhoods, the analysis aims to identify for which models these intrinsic features in the dataset structure impact accuracy performance. The code to reproduce the experiments is available at: https://split.to/Graph-Reproducibility.</p>

    <h3>Ti-DC-GNN: Incorporating Time-Interval Dual Graphs for Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Ivanova, Nikita Severin, Ivan Kireev, Ilya Makarov, Andrey Savchenko, Dmitrii Kiselev</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are essential for personalized content delivery and have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, traditional recommender systems are limited in their ability to capture complex relationships between users and items. Recently, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a promising solution for improving recommender systems by incorporating temporal and sequential information in dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel method, “Ti-DC-GNN” (Time-Interval Dual Causal Graph Neural Networks), based on an intermediate representation of graph evolution as a sequence of time-interval graphs. The main parts of the method are the novel forms of interval graphs: graph of causality and graph of consequence that explicitly preserve inter-relationships between edges (user-items interactions). The local and global message passing are developed based on edge memory to identify both short-term and long-term dependencies. Experiments on several well-known datasets show that our method consistently outperforms modern temporal GNNs with node memory alone in dynamic edge prediction tasks.</p>

    <h3>Streaming Session-Based Recommendation: When Graph Neural Networks meet the Neighborhood (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sara Latifi, Dietmar Jannach</p>
    <p>Frequent updates and model retraining are important in various application areas of recommender systems, e.g., news recommendation. Moreover, in such domains, we may not only face the problem of dealing with a constant stream of new data, but also with anonymous users, leading to the problem of streaming session-based recommendation (SSR). Such problem settings have attracted increased interest in recent years, and different deep learning architectures were proposed that support fast updates of the underlying prediction models when new data arrive. In a recent paper, a method based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) was proposed as being superior than previous methods for the SSR problem. The baselines in the reported experiments included different machine learning models. However, several earlier studies have shown that often conceptually simpler methods, e.g., based on nearest neighbors, can be highly effective for session-based recommendation problems. In this work, we report a similar phenomenon for the streaming configuration. We first reproduce the results of the mentioned GNN method and then show that simpler methods are able to outperform this complex state-of-the-art neural method on two datasets. Overall, our work points to continued methodological issues in the academic community, e.g., in terms of the choice of baselines and reproducibility.1</p>

    <h3>Tripartite Heterogeneous Graph Propagation for Large-scale Social Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donghyun Kwak, Minkyu Kim, Hanock Kwak, Jae-Han Cho, Nako Sung, Jung-Woo Ha, Kyung-Min Kim, Sangkwon Sim, Young-Jin Park, Jihun Kwon</p>
    <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been emerging as a promising method for relational representation including recommender systems. However, various challenging issues of social graphs hinder the practical usage of GNNs for social recommendation, such as their complex noisy connections and high heterogeneity. The oversmoothing of GNNs is an obstacle of GNN-based social recommendation as well. Here we propose a new graph embedding method Heterogeneous Graph Propagation (HGP) to tackle these issues. HGP uses a group-user-item tripartite graph as input to reduce the number of edges and the complexity of paths in a social graph. To solve the oversmoothing issue, HGP embeds nodes under a personalized PageRank based propagation scheme, separately for group-user graph and user-item graph. Node embeddings from each graph are integrated using an attention mechanism. We evaluate our HGP on a large-scale real-world dataset consisting of 1,645,279 nodes and 4,711,208 edges. The experimental results show that HGP outperforms several baselines in terms of AUC and F1-score metrics.</p>
