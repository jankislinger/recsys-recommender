    <h3>ReChorus2.0: A Modular and Task-Flexible Recommendation Library (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peijie Sun, Hanyu Li, Zhiyu He, Weizhi Ma, Shaoping Ma, Min Zhang, Jiayu Li</p>
    <p>With the applications of recommendation systems rapidly expanding, an increasing number of studies have focused on every aspect of recommender systems with different data inputs, models, and task settings. Therefore, a flexible library is needed to help researchers implement the experimental strategies they require. Existing open libraries for recommendation scenarios have enabled reproducing various recommendation methods and provided standard implementations. However, these libraries often impose certain restrictions on data and seldom support the same model to perform different tasks and input formats, limiting users from customized explorations. To fill the gap, we propose ReChorus2.0, a modular and task-flexible library for recommendation researchers. Based on ReChorus, we upgrade the supported input formats, models, and training\&evaluation strategies to help realize more recommendation tasks with more data types. The main contributions of ReChorus2.0 include:    (1) Realization of complex and practical tasks, including reranking and CTR prediction tasks;   (2) Inclusion of various context-aware and rerank recommenders;   (3) Extension of existing and new models to support different tasks with the same models;   (4) Support of highly-customized input with impression logs, negative items, or click labels, as well as user, item, and situation contexts.   To summarize, ReChorus2.0 serves as a comprehensive and flexible library better aligning with the practical problems in the recommendation scenario and catering to more diverse research needs. The implementation and detailed tutorials of ReChorus2.0 can be found at https://github.com/THUwangcy/ReChorus.</p>

    <h3>Folding: Why Good Models Sometimes Make Spurious Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Mayoraz, Karthik Lakshmanan, John R. Anderson, Hubert Pham, Doris Xin</p>
    <p>In recommender systems based on low rank factorization of a partially observed user-item matrix, a common phenomenon that plagues many otherwise effective models is the interleaving of good and spurious recommendations in the top-K results. A single incongruous recommendation can dramatically impact the perceived quality of a recommender system. In this work, we investigate folding, a major contributing factor to spurious recommendations. Folding refers to the unintentional overlap of disparate groups of users and items in the low-rank embedding vector space, induced by improper handling of missing data. We formally define a metric that quantifies the severity of folding in a trained system, to assist in diagnosing its potential to shock users with inappropriate recommendations. The folding metric complements existing information retrieval metrics that focus on the number of good recommendations and their ranks but ignore the impact of undesired recommendations. We motivate our definition of the folding metric on synthetic data and evaluate its effectiveness on both synthetic and real world datasets. We study the relationship between the folding metric and other characteristics of recommender systems and observe that optimizing for goodness metrics can lead to high folding and thus more spurious recommendations.</p>
