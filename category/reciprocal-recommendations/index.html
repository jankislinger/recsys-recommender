    <h3>Matching Theory-based Recommendation in Online Dating (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riku Togashi, Yoji Tomita, Daisuke Moriwaki</p>
    <p>Online dating platforms provide people with the opportunity to find a partner. Recommender systems in online dating platforms suggest one side of users to the other side of users. This reciprocal recommendation problem arises in online dating [26 , 31 ], job recommendation [2] and peer learning process [27]. Reciprocal recommender systems (RRSs) must take into account two aspects which do not arise in standard recommender systems. One aspect is the mutual interests of users. Even if one user has a strong interest in a particular user, she/he may have no interest in him/her at all. Thus, RRSs should be based on the interests of both sides of users. The other important aspect is capacities of the users; it is impossible for a user to keep up with all the candidates. Popular users are often recommended very frequently. As a result, a few super stars receive a large proportion of likes, overwhelming the time that they can spend for screening. RRSs should be designed to alleviate such problems to increase user satisfaction. The two-sided matching problem is to “match” one side of people and the other side in a situation where each person has a different preference and a matching capacity. This field is called matching theory, and various algorithms have been developed since [ 11 , 29 ]. Matching theory is applied in the analyses of marriage markets [4, 8], school choice [1] and job matching for physicians [28]. In this talk, we discuss the potential interactions between RRSs and matching theory. We also present our ongoing project to deploy a matching theory-based recommender system (MTRS) in a real-world online dating platform. This talk covers other important directions regarding RRSs, including scalability, algorithmic fairness, bandit algorithm, and online experimentation.</p>

    <h3>Building a reciprocal recommendation system at scale from scratch: Learnings from one of Japan’s prominent dating applications (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Ramanathan</p>
    <p>Online dating platforms have changed the paradigm of how people seek potential relationships. In this context, reciprocal recommendation systems consider the mutual ’match’ potential between users, i.e users who are likely to interact and potentially ’like’ each other. We present our experiences on how we devised algorithms to overcome data specific nuances, built and deployed the system from scratch in a relatively short time-span for one of the prominent dating applications in Japan.</p>

    <h3>Providing Explanations for Recommendations in Reciprocal Environments (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sarit Kraus, Akiva Kleinerman, Rosenfeld Ariel</p>
    <p>Automated platforms which support users in finding a mutually beneficial match, such as online dating and job recruitment sites, are becoming increasingly popular. These platforms often include recommender systems that assist users in finding a suitable match. While recommender systems which provide explanations for their recommendations have shown many benefits, explanation methods have yet to be adapted and tested in recommending suitable matches. In this paper, we introduce and extensively evaluate the use of reciprocal explanations– explanations which provide reasoning as to why both parties are expected to benefit from the match. Through an extensive empirical evaluation, in both simulated and real-world dating platforms with 287 human participants, we find that when the acceptance of a recommendation involves a significant cost (e.g., monetary or emotional), reciprocal explanations outperform standard explanation methods which consider the recommendation receiver alone. However, to the contrary of to what one may expect, when the cost of accepting a recommendation is negligible, reciprocal explanations are shown to be less effective than the traditional explanation methods.</p>
