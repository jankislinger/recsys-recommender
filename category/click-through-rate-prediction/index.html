    <h3>MLoRA: Multi-Domain Low-Rank Adaptive Network for CTR Prediction (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Libin Yang, Haining Gao, Wei Ning, Luwei Yang, Zhiming Yang, Dehong Gao, Guannan Zhang, Xiaoyan Cai</p>
    <p>Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is one of the fundamental tasks in the industry, especially in e-commerce, social media, and streaming media. It directly impacts website revenues, user satisfaction, and user retention. However, real-world production platforms often encompass various domains to cater for diverse customer needs. Traditional CTR prediction models struggle in multi-domain recommendation scenarios, facing challenges of data sparsity and disparate data distributions across domains. Existing multi-domain recommendation approaches introduce specific-domain modules for each domain, which partially address these issues but often significantly increase model parameters and lead to insufficient training. In this paper, we propose a Multi-domain Low-Rank Adaptive network (MLoRA) for CTR prediction, where we introduce a specialized LoRA module for each domain. This approach enhances the model’s performance in multi-domain CTR prediction tasks and is able to be applied to various deep-learning models. We evaluate the proposed method on several multi-domain datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our MLoRA approach achieves a significant improvement compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we deploy it in a real-world e-commerce production website. The online A/B testing results indicate the superiority and flexibility in real-world production environments.</p>

    <h3>Task Aware Feature Extraction Framework for Sequential Dependence Multi-Task Learning (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Cheng, Wenfang Lin, Xuewen Tao, Mingming Ha, Qiongxu Ma, Xiaobo Guo</p>
    <p>In online recommendation, financial service, etc., the most common application of multi-task learning (MTL) is the multi-step conversion estimations. A core property of the multi-step conversion is the sequential dependence among tasks. Most existing works focus far more on the specific post-view click-through rate (CTR) and post-click conversion rate (CVR) estimations, which neglect the generalization of sequential dependence multi-task learning (SDMTL). Besides, the performance of the SDMTL framework is also deteriorated by the interference derived from implicitly conflict information passing between adjacent tasks. In this paper, a systematic learning paradigm of the SDMTL problem is established for the first time, which can transform the SDMTL problem into a general MTL problem and be applicable to more general multi-step conversion scenarios with longer conversion path or stronger task dependence. Also, the distribution dependence between adjacent task spaces is illustrated from a theoretical point of view. On the other hand, an SDMTL architecture, named Task Aware Feature Extraction (TAFE), is developed to enable dynamic task representation learning from a sample-wise view. TAFE selectively reconstructs the implicit shared information corresponding to each sample case and performs explicit task-specific extraction under dependence constraints. Extensive experiments on offline public and real-world industrial datasets, and online A/B implementations demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of proposed theoretical and implementation frameworks.</p>

    <h3>Deep Situation-Aware Interaction Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongkang Wang, Dong Wang, Yisong Yu, Beihong Jin, Yapeng Zhang, Jian Dong, Xingxing Wang, Shuli Wang, Yimin Lv</p>
    <p>User behavior sequence modeling plays a significant role in Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction on e-commerce platforms. Except for the interacted items, user behaviors contain rich interaction information, such as the behavior type, time, location, etc. However, so far, the information related to user behaviors has not yet been fully exploited. In the paper, we propose the concept of a situation and situational features for distinguishing interaction behaviors and then design a CTR model named Deep Situation-Aware Interaction Network (DSAIN). DSAIN first adopts the reparameterization trick to reduce noise in the original user behavior sequences. Then it learns the embeddings of situational features by feature embedding parameterization and tri-directional correlation fusion. Finally, it obtains the embedding of behavior sequence via heterogeneous situation aggregation. We conduct extensive offline experiments on three real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DSAIN model. More importantly, DSAIN has increased the CTR by 2.70\%, the CPM by 2.62\%, and the GMV by 2.16\% in the online A/B test. Now, DSAIN has been deployed on the Meituan food delivery platform and serves the main traffic of the Meituan takeout app. Our source code is available at https://github.com/W-void/DSAIN</p>

    <h3>Unleash the Power of Context: Enhancing Large-Scale Recommender Systems with Context-Based Prediction Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davorin Kopič, Jan Hartman, Assaf Klein, Natalia Silberstein</p>
    <p>In this work, we introduce the notion of Context-Based Prediction Models. A Context-Based Prediction Model determines the probability of a user’s action (such as a click or a conversion) solely by relying on user and contextual features, without considering any specific features of the item itself. We have identified numerous valuable applications for this modeling approach, including training an auxiliary context-based model to estimate click probability and incorporating its prediction as a feature in CTR prediction models.Our experiments indicate that this enhancement brings significant improvements in offline and online business metrics while having minimal impact on the cost of serving. Overall, our work offers a simple and scalable, yet powerful approach for enhancing the performance of large-scale commercial recommender systems, with broad implications for the field of personalized recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Leveraging Multi-Faceted User Preferences for Improving Click-Through Rate Predictions (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan Li</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have been widely adopted by many firms across various industries over the past decade, as they could provide numerous economic benefits to the industry, such as influencing consumer choices, generating the lift in sales, and enhancing consumer trust. Many currently-deployed recommender systems primiarily optimize the similarity measure following the Collaborative Filtering paradigm during the recommendation performance, which focuses on the matching between targeted users and items of their interests. Although effective and useful in many cases, these still face several important challenges to fully address consumers’ concerns. In particular, they usually provide recommendations of the most similar items related to the consumption records, without taking into account the multi-faceted consumer preferences. For example, some consumers would be satisfied to receive recommendations that are novel and unexpected to broaden their horizons, while others might be interested to receive recommendations from other product categories to expand their interests. Falling to do so would lead to the filter bubble and exploration-exploitation trade-off phenomenon, which is undesirable because it would significantly reduce sales diversity and deteriorate user satisfaction with recommender systems.<br>In my thesis proposal, I will describe new methods to design recommender systems following two research streams to tackle the aforementioned challenges, namely unexpected recommender system and cross-domain system. In particular, unexpected recommender systems address consumers’ desire for variety, and aim at providing novel and useful recommendations simultaneously, while cross-domain recommender systems learn consumer preferences from their behaviors in other domains to better predict their behaviors in the target domain. The proposed models are capable of significantly improving recommendation performance and user satisfaction, as demonstrated through extensive offline and online experiments discussed in this proposal.</p>

    <h3>Unbiased Ad Click Prediction for Position-aware Advertising Systems (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chih-Jen Lin, Jui-Yang Hsia, Bowen Yuan, Yaxu Liu, Zhenhua Dong</p>
    <p>Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a core problem of building advertising systems. In many real-world applications, because an ad placed in various positions has different click probabilities, the position information should be considered in both training and prediction. For such position-aware systems, existing approaches learn CTR models from clicks/not-clicks on historically displayed events by leveraging the position information in different ways. In this work, we explain that these approaches may give a heavily biased model. We first point out that in position-aware systems, two different types of selection biases coexist in displayed events. Secondly, we explain that some approaches attempting to eliminate the position effect from clicks/not-clicks may possess an additional bias. Finally, to obtain an unbiased CTR model for position-aware systems, we propose a novel counterfactual learning framework. Experiments confirm both our analysis on selection biases and the effectiveness of our proposed counterfactual learning framework.</p>

    <h3>PAL: A Position-bias Aware Learning Framework for CTR Prediction in Live Recommender Systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuzhou Zhang, Jinkai Yu, Qing Liu, Ruiming Tang, Huifeng Guo</p>
    <p>Predicting Click-Through Rate (CTR) accurately is crucial in recommender systems. In general, a CTR model is trained based on user feedback which is collected from offline traffic logs. However, position-bias exists in user feedback because a user clicks on an item may not only because she favors it but also because it is in a good position. One way is to model position as a feature in the training data, which is widely used in industrial applications due to its simplicity. Specifically, a default position value has to be used to predict CTR in online inference since the actual position information is not available at that time. However, using different default position values may result in completely different recommendation results. As a result, this approach leads to sub-optimal online performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Position-bias Aware Learning framework (PAL) for CTR prediction in a live recommender system. It is able to model the position-bias in offline training and conduct online inference without position information. Extensive online experiments are conducted to demonstrate that PAL outperforms the baselines by 3% – 35% in terms of CTR and CVR in a three-week AB test. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Field-aware Probabilistic Embedding Neural Network for CTR Prediction (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Jinkai, Huifeng Guo, Xiuqiang He, Jiajin Li, Shengyu Zhang, Weiwen Liu, Ruiming Tang</p>
    <p>For Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, Field-aware Factorization Machines (FFM) have exhibited great effectiveness by considering field information. However, it is also observed that FFM suffers from the overfitting problem in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Field-aware Probabilistic Embedding Neural Network (FPENN) model with both good generalization ability and high accuracy. FPENN estimates the probability distribution of the field-aware embedding rather than using the single point estimation (the maximum a posteriori estimation) to prevent overfitting. Both low-order and high-order feature interactions are considered to improve the accuracy. FPENN consists of three components, i.e., FPE component, Quadratic component and Deep component. FPE component outputs probabilistic embedding to the other two components, where various confidence levels for feature embeddings are incorporated to enhance the robustness and the accuracy. Quadratic component is designed for extracting low-order feature interactions, while Deep component aims at capturing high-order feature interactions. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, Avazu and Criteo. The results confirm that our model alleviates the overfitting problem while has a higher accuracy.</p>
