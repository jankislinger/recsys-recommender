    <h3>FR-FMSS: Federated Recommendation via Fake Marks and Secret Sharing (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaohao Lin, Weike Pan, Zhong Ming</p>
    <p>With the implementation of privacy protection laws such as GDPR, it is increasingly difficult for organizations to legally collect user data. However, a typical recommendation algorithm based on machine learning requires user data to learn user preferences. In order to protect user privacy, a lot of recent works turn to develop federated learning-based recommendation algorithms. However, some of these works can only protect the users’ rating values, some can only protect the users’ rating behavior (i.e., the engaged items), and only a few works can protect the both types of privacy at the same time. Moreover, most of them can only be applied to a specific algorithm or a class of similar algorithms. In this paper, we propose a generic cross-user federated recommendation framework called FR-FMSS. Our FR-FMSS can not only protect the two types of user privacy, but can also be applied to most recommendation algorithms for rating prediction, item ranking, and sequential recommendation. Specifically, we use fake marks and secret sharing to modify the data uploaded by the clients to the server, which protects user privacy without loss of model accuracy. We take three representative recommendation algorithms, i.e., MF-MPC, eALS, and Fossil, as examples to show how to apply our FR-FMSS to a specific algorithm.</p>

    <h3>Horizontal Cross-Silo Federated Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saikishore Kalloori</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RSs) completely rely on the knowledge of training information to generate recommendations. However, due to privacy, ownership, and protection of users’ information, such training information is not easily accessible or shared with an RS. Moreover, with recent regulations in privacy laws (e.g, GDPR), collecting user preferences and perform centralized training may not be feasible. Federated Learning (FL) is a form of machine learning technique where the goal is to learn a high-quality recommendation model without never directly accessing raw training data. In this work, we specifically focus on situations where multiple stakeholders (referred to as corporate companies like e-commerce business partners, hospitals, banks, news media publishers) participate in federated learning to build a shared recommendation model. We performed offline experiments by simulating a real federated learning setup and investigated the benefits federated learning brings to stakeholders in terms of ranking compared to an RS model trained without participating in federated learning. Our experimental results reveal that stakeholders can significantly benefit from federated learning to generate accurate recommendations. Moreover, we also study the use and benefits of federated learning in situations when there are not enough preferences available for users.</p>
