    <h3>A Unified Graph Transformer for Overcoming Isolations in Multi-modal Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixuan Yi, Iadh Ounis</p>
    <p>With the rapid development of online multimedia services, especially in e-commerce platforms, there is a pressing need for personalised recommendation systems that can effectively encode the diverse multi-modal content associated with each item. However, we argue that existing multi-modal recommender systems typically use isolated processes for both feature extraction and modality modelling. Such isolated processes can harm the recommendation performance. Firstly, an isolated extraction process underestimates the importance of effective feature extraction in multi-modal recommendations, potentially incorporating non-relevant information, which is harmful to item representations. Second, an isolated modality modelling process produces disjointed embeddings for item modalities due to the individual processing of each modality, which leads to a suboptimal fusion of user/item representations for effective user preferences prediction. We hypothesise that the use of a unified model for addressing both aforementioned isolated processes will enable the consistent extraction and cohesive fusion of joint multi-modal features, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of multi-modal recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called Unified Multi-modal Graph Transformer (UGT), which firstly leverages a multi-way transformer to extract aligned multi-modal features from raw data for top-k recommendation. Subsequently, we build a unified graph neural network in our UGT model to jointly fuse the user/item representations with their corresponding multi-modal features. Using the graph transformer architecture of our UGT model, we show that the UGT model can achieve significant effectiveness gains, especially when jointly optimised with the commonly-used multi-modal recommendation losses. Our extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed UGT model over seven existing state-of-the-art recommendation approaches.</p>

    <h3>Entity-Aware Collections Ranking: A Joint Scoring Approach (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youhe Chen, Sihao Chen, Sheng Li, Dong Yang</p>
    <p>Recommender systems in academia and industry typically predict Click-Through Rate (CTR) at the item or entity level. In practical scenarios, products can take on various forms and designs. We present a novel joint scoring framework that supports the listwise ranking of a collection composed of multiple entities. It learns the best combination of entities to be displayed to the user. We also introduce a novel dual attention mechanism that better captures the user’s interest in the collection. Our approach demonstrated superior performance through offline and online experiments and has been deployed to Shopee’s Shop Ads across all markets.</p>

    <h3>Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-Behaviour Contrastive Learning for Effective Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iadh Ounis, Zeyuan Meng, Zixuan Yi</p>
    <p>Real-world recommendation scenarios usually need to handle diverse user-item interaction behaviours, including page views, adding items into carts, and purchasing activities. The interactions that precede the actual target behaviour (e.g. purchasing an item) allow to better capture the user’s preferences from different angles, and are used  as auxiliary information (e.g. page views) to enrich the system’s knowledge about the users’ preferences, thereby helping to enhance recommendation for the target behaviour. Despite efforts in modelling the users’ multi-behaviour interaction information, the existing multi-behaviour recommenders  still face two challenges: (1) Data sparsity across multiple user behaviours is a common issue that limits the recommendation performance, particularly for the target behaviour, which typically exhibits fewer interactions compared to other auxiliary behaviours. (2) Noisy auxiliary interactive behaviour where the information in the auxiliary information  might be non-relevant to recommendation.  In this case, a direct  adoption of  contrastive learning between the target behaviour and the auxiliary behaviours will amplify the noise in the auxiliary behaviours, thereby negatively impacting the real semantics that can be derived from the target behaviour. To address these two challenges, we propose a new model called Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-behaviour Contrastive Learning for Recommendation (KEMCL). In particular, to address the problem of sparse user multi-behaviour interaction information, we leverage a tailored knowledge graph (KG) to enrich the semantic representations of items, and generate supervision signals through self-supervised learning so as to enhance  recommendation. In addition, we develop two contrastive learning (CL) methods, inter CL and intra CL, to alleviate the problem of noisy auxiliary interactions. Extensive experiments on three public recommendation datasets show that our proposed KEMCL model significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In particular, our KEMCL model outperforms the best baseline performance, namely KMCLR,  by 5.42% on the large Tmall dataset.</p>

    <h3>Scale-Invariant Learning-to-Rank (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ye-Sheen Lim, Alessio Petrozziello, Xiaoke Liu, Christian Sommeregger</p>
    <p>At Expedia, learning-to-rank (LTR) models plays a key role on our website in sorting and presenting information more relevant to users, such as search filters, property rooms, amenities, and images. A major challenge in deploying these models is ensuring consistent feature scaling between training and production data, as discrepancies can lead to unreliable rankings when deployed. Normalization techniques like feature standardization and batch normalization could address these issues but are impractical in production due to latency impacts and the difficulty of distributed real-time inference. To address consistent feature scaling issue, we introduce a scale-invariant LTR framework which combines a deep and a wide neural network to mathematically guarantee scale-invariance in the model at both training and prediction time.</p>

    <h3>Is It Really Complementary? Revisiting Behavior-based Labels for Complementary Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazushi Okamoto, Kai Sugahara, Chihiro Yamasaki</p>
    <p>Complementary recommendation is a type of item-to-item recommendation that recommends what should be purchased together for an item. Previous studies have traditionally used behavior-based labels (BBLs) that are constructed from the co-purchase logs of users for training and evaluation because rigorous label construction for complements is inefficient. However, the fact that many item pairs in BBLs are not functionally complementary, even though they are frequently co-purchased, has been overlooked. This study aimed to re-evaluate the validity of BBLs through functional relationships and provide directions for their improvement. Quantitative analysis using manually annotated function-based labels (FBLs) as correct labels revealed that the accuracy of the complementary recommendations generated by BBLs was below 50%, suggesting potential functional incompatibility within BBLs. Existing models that were trained on BBLs were similarly inaccurate, indicating the unreliability of the evaluations in existing studies. Finally, we proposed a label correction method for BBLs using a small set of FBLs, thereby providing a direction for reliable complementary recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Do Not Wait: Learning Re-Ranking Model Without User Feedback At Serving Time in E-Commerce (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sirui Chen, Changshuo Zhang, Zhiyu Li, Quan Lin, Xiao Zhang, Yuan Wang, Jun Xu</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have been widely used in e-commerce, and re-ranking models are playing an increasingly significant role in the domain, which leverages the inter-item influence and determines the final recommendation lists. Online learning methods keep updating a deployed model with the latest available samples to capture the shifting of the underlying data distribution in e-commerce. However, they depend on the availability of real user feedback, which may be delayed by hours or even days, such as item purchases, leading to a lag in model enhancement.  In this paper, we propose a novel extension of online learning methods for re-ranking modeling, which we term LAST, an acronym for Learning At Serving Time. It circumvents the requirement of user feedback by using a surrogate model to provide the instructional signal needed to steer model improvement. Upon receiving an online request, LAST finds and applies a model modification on the fly before generating a recommendation result for the request. The modification is request-specific and transient. It means the modification is tailored to and only to the current request to capture the specific context of the request. After a request, the modification is discarded, which helps to prevent error propagation and stabilizes the online learning procedure since the predictions of the surrogate model may be inaccurate. Most importantly, as a complement to feedback-based online learning methods, LAST can be seamlessly integrated into existing online learning systems to create a more adaptive and responsive recommendation experience. Comprehensive experiments, both offline and online, affirm that LAST outperforms state-of-the-art re-ranking models.</p>

    <h3>End-to-End Cost-Effective Incentive Recommendation under Budget Constraint with Uplift Modeling (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunpeng Weng, Xiuqiang He, Hao Yang, Dugang Liu, Xing Tang, Zexu Sun</p>
    <p>In modern online platforms, incentive (<i>e.g</i>., discounts, bonus) are essential factors that enhance user engagement and increase platform revenue. Over recent years, uplift modeling has been introduced as a strategic approach to assign incentive to individual customers. Especially, in many real-world applications, online platforms can only incentivize customers with specific budget constraints. This problem can be reformulated as the multi-choice knapsack problem (MCKP). The objective of this optimization is to select the optimal incentive for each customer in order to maximize the return-on-investment (ROI). Recent works in this field frequently tackle the problem of budget allocation using a two-stage approach. %: the first stage utilizes causal inference algorithms to estimate the individual treatment effect or uplift, while the second stage employs integer programming techniques to determine the optimal solution for budget allocation. However, this solution is confronted with the following challenges: (1) The commonly used causal inference methods often ignore the domain knowledge in online marketing, where the expected response curve of a customer should be monotonic and smooth as the incentive increases. (2) There is an optimality gap between the two stages, resulting in inferior sub-optimal allocation performance, which is due to the loss of the incentive recommendation information for the uplift prediction under the limited budget constraint. To address these challenges, we propose a novel <u>E</u>nd-to-<u>E</u>nd Cost-<u>E</u>ffective <u>I</u>ncentive <u>R</u>ecommendation (E$^3$IR) model under the budget constraint. Specifically, our methods consist of two modules: the uplift prediction module and the differentiable allocation module. In the uplift prediction module, we construct prediction heads to capture the incremental improvement between adjacent treatments with the marketing domain constraints (<i>i.e.</i>, monotonic and smooth). %To obtain a monotonic user response curve, we constrain the output of each prediction head to be non-negative. In the differentiable allocation module, we incorporate integer linear programming (ILP) as a differentiable layer input. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on both public and real product datasets, which demonstrate that our E$^3$IR improves allocation performance compared to existing two-stage approaches.</p>

    <h3>A Multimodal Single-Branch Embedding Network for Recommendation in Cold-Start and Missing Modality Scenarios (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Hausberger, Markus Schedl, Christian Ganhör, Shah Nawaz, Marta Moscati</p>
    <p>Most recommender systems adopt collaborative filtering (CF) and provide recommendations based on past collective interactions. Therefore, the performance of CF algorithms degrades when few or no interactions are available, a scenario referred to as cold-start. To address this issue, previous work relies on models leveraging both collaborative data and side information on the users or items. Similar to multimodal learning, these models aim at combining collaborative and content representations in a shared embedding space. In this work we propose a novel technique for multimodal recommendation, relying on a multimodal Single-Branch embedding network for Recommendation (SiBraR). Leveraging weight-sharing, SiBraR encodes interaction data as well as multimodal side information using the same single-branch embedding network on different modalities. This makes SiBraR effective in scenarios of missing modality, including cold start. Our extensive experiments on large-scale recommendation datasets from three different recommendation domains (music, movie, and e-commerce) and providing multimodal content information (audio, text, image, labels, and interactions) show that SiBraR significantly outperforms CF as well as state-of-the-art content-based RSs in cold-start scenarios, and is competitive in warm scenarios. We show that SiBraR’s recommendations are accurate in missing modality scenarios, and that the model is able to map different modalities to the same region of the shared embedding space, hence reducing the modality gap.</p>

    <h3>Embedding based retrieval for long tail search queries in ecommerce (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arun Udayashankar, Yuyang Zhang, Akshay Kekuda</p>
    <p>In this abstract we present a series of optimizations we performed on the two-tower model architecture [14], and training and evaluation datasets to implement semantic product search at Best Buy. Search queries on bestbuy.com follow the pareto distribution whereby a minority of them account for most searches. This leaves us with a long tail of search queries that have low frequency of issuance. The queries in the long tail suffer from very spare interaction signals. Our current work focuses on building a model to serve the long tail queries. We present a series of optimizations we have done to this model to maximize conversion for the purpose of retrieval from the catalog. The first optimization we present is using a large language model to improve the sparsity of conversion signals. The second optimization is pretraining an off-the-shelf transformer-based model on the Best Buy catalog data. The third optimization we present is on the finetuning front. We use query-to-query pairs in addition to query-to-product pairs and combining the above strategies for finetuning the model. We also demonstrate how merging the weights of these finetuned models improves the evaluation metrics. Finally, we provide a recipe for curating an evaluation dataset for continuous monitoring of model performance with human-in-the-loop evaluation. We found that adding this recall mechanism to our current term match-based recall improved conversion by 3% in an online A/B test.</p>

    <h3>Integrating Offline Reinforcement Learning with Transformers for Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xumei Xi, Yang Wu, Liwen Ouyang, Yuke Zhao, Quan Liu</p>
    <p>We consider the problem of sequential recommendation, where the current recommendation is made based on past interactions. This recommendation task requires efficient processing of the sequential data and aims to provide recommendations that maximize the long-term reward. To this end, we train a farsighted recommender by using an offline RL algorithm with the policy network in our model architecture that has been initialized from a pre-trained transformer model. The pre-trained model leverages the superb ability of the transformer to process sequential information. Compared to prior works that rely on online interaction via simulation, we focus on implementing a fully offline RL framework that is able to converge in a fast and stable way. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we show that our method is robust across various recommendation regimes, including e-commerce and movie suggestions. Compared to state-of-the-art supervised learning algorithms, our algorithm yields recommendations of higher quality, demonstrating the clear advantage of combining RL and transformers.</p>

    <h3>Complementary Product Recommendation for Long-tail Products (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rastislav Papso</p>
    <p>Identifying complementary relations between products plays a key role in e-commerce Recommender Systems (RS). Existing methods in Complementary Product Recommendation (CPR), however, focus only on identifying complementary relations in huge and data-rich catalogs, while none of them considers real-world scenarios of small and medium e-commerce platforms with limited number of interactions. In this paper, we discuss our research proposal that addresses the problem of identifying complementary relations in such sparse settings. To overcome the data sparsity problem, we propose to first learn complementary relations in large and data-rich catalogs and then transfer learned knowledge to small and scarce ones. To be able to map individual products across different catalogs and thus transfer learned relations between them, we propose to create Product Universal Embedding Space (PUES) using textual and visual product meta-data, which serves as a common ground for the products from arbitrary catalog.</p>

    <h3>M3REC: A Meta-based Multi-scenario Multi-task Recommendation Framework (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zerong Lan, Yingyi Zhang, Xianneng Li</p>
    <p>Users in recommender systems exhibit multi-behavior in multiple business scenarios on real-world e-commerce platforms. A crucial challenge in such systems is to make recommendations for each business scenario at the same time. On top of this, multiple predictions (e.g., Click Through Rate and Conversion Rate) need to be made simultaneously in order to improve the platform revenue. Research focus on making recommendations for several business scenarios is in the field of Multi-Scenario Recommendation (MSR), and Multi-Task Recommendation (MTR) mainly attempts to solve the possible problems in collaboratively executing different recommendation tasks. However, existing researchers have paid attention to either MSR or MTR, ignoring the integration of MSR and MTR that faces the issue of conflict between scenarios and tasks. To address the above issue, we propose a Meta-based Multi-scenario Multi-task RECommendation framework (M3REC) to serve multiple tasks in multiple business scenarios by a unified model. However, integrating MSR and MTR in a proper manner is non-trivial due to: 1) Unified representation problem: Users’ and items’ representation behave Non-i.i.d in different scenarios and tasks which takes inconsistency into recommendations. 2) Synchronous optimization problem: Tasks distribution varies in different scenarios, and a unified optimization method is needed to optimize multi-tasks in multi-scenarios. Thus, to unified represent users and items, we design a Meta-Item-Embedding Generator (MIEG) and a User-Preference Transformer (UPT). The MIEG module can generate initialized item embedding using item features through meta-learning technology, and the UPT module can transfer user preferences in other scenarios. Besides, the M3REC framework uses a specifically designed backbone network together with a task-specific aggregate gate to promote all tasks to achieve the purpose of optimizing multiple tasks in multiple business scenarios within one model. Experiments on two public datasets have shown that M3REC outperforms those compared MSR and MTR state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>Deep Situation-Aware Interaction Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongkang Wang, Dong Wang, Yisong Yu, Beihong Jin, Yapeng Zhang, Jian Dong, Xingxing Wang, Shuli Wang, Yimin Lv</p>
    <p>User behavior sequence modeling plays a significant role in Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction on e-commerce platforms. Except for the interacted items, user behaviors contain rich interaction information, such as the behavior type, time, location, etc. However, so far, the information related to user behaviors has not yet been fully exploited. In the paper, we propose the concept of a situation and situational features for distinguishing interaction behaviors and then design a CTR model named Deep Situation-Aware Interaction Network (DSAIN). DSAIN first adopts the reparameterization trick to reduce noise in the original user behavior sequences. Then it learns the embeddings of situational features by feature embedding parameterization and tri-directional correlation fusion. Finally, it obtains the embedding of behavior sequence via heterogeneous situation aggregation. We conduct extensive offline experiments on three real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DSAIN model. More importantly, DSAIN has increased the CTR by 2.70\%, the CPM by 2.62\%, and the GMV by 2.16\% in the online A/B test. Now, DSAIN has been deployed on the Meituan food delivery platform and serves the main traffic of the Meituan takeout app. Our source code is available at https://github.com/W-void/DSAIN</p>

    <h3>Stability of Explainable Recommendation (2023)</h3>

    <p>Explainable Recommendation has been gaining attention over the last few years in industry and academia. Explanations provided along with recommendations for each user in a recommender system framework have many uses: particularly reasoning why a suggestion is provided and how well an item aligns with a user’s personalized preferences. Hence, explanations can play a huge role in influencing users to purchase products. However, the reliability of the explanations under varying scenarios has not been strictly verified in an empirical perspective. Unreliable explanations can bear strong consequences such as attackers leveraging explanations for manipulating and tempting users to purchase target items: that the attackers would want to promote. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of existent feature-oriented explainable recommenders, particularly analyzing their performance under different levels of external noises added into model parameters. We conducted experiments by analyzing three important state-of-the-art explainable recommenders when trained on two widely used e-commerce based recommendation datasets of different scales. We observe that all the explainable models are vulnerable to increased noise levels. Experimental results verify our hypothesis that the ability to explain recommendations does decrease along with increasing noise levels and particularly adversarial noise does contribute to a much stronger decrease. Our study presents an empirical verification on the topic of robust explanations in recommender systems which can be extended to different types of explainable recommenders in RS.</p>

    <h3>LightSAGE: Graph Neural Networks for Large Scale Item Retrieval in Shopee’s Advertisement Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Zeng, Chenfei Wang, Yan Shen, Dang Minh Nguyen</p>
    <p>Graph Neural Network (GNN) is the trending solution for item retrieval in recommendation problems. Most recent reports, however, focus heavily on new model architectures. This may bring some gaps when applying GNN in the industrial setup, where, besides the model, constructing graph and handling data sparsity also play critical roles in the overall success of the project. In this work, we report how we apply GNN for large-scale e-commerce item retrieval at Shopee. We detail our simple yet novel and impactful techniques in graph construction, modeling, and handling data skewness. Specifically, we construct high-quality item graphs by combining strong-signal user behaviors with high-precision collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm. We then develop a new GNN architecture named LightSAGE to produce high-quality items’ embeddings for vector search. Finally, we develop multiple strategies to handle cold-start and long-tail items, which are critical in an advertisement (ads) system. Our models bring improvement in offline evaluations, online A/B tests, and are deployed to the main traffic of Shopee’s Recommendation Advertisement system.</p>
