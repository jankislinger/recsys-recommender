    <h3>A Crowdsourcing Triage Algorithm for Geopolitical Forecasting (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Huber, Tsai-Ching Lu, Mohammad Rostami</p>
    <p>Predicting the outcome of geopolitical events is of huge importance to many organizations, as these forecasts provide actionable intelligence that may be used to make consequential decisions. Prediction polling is a common method used in crowdsourcing platforms for geopolitical forecasting, where a group of non-expert participants are asked to predict the outcome of a geopolitical event and the collected responses are aggregated to generate a forecast. It has been demonstrated that forecasts by such a crowd can be more accurate than the forecasts of experts. However, geopolitical prediction polling is challenging because participants are highly heterogeneous and diverse in terms of their skills and background knowledge and human resources are often limited. As a result, it is crucial to refer each question to the subset of participants that possess suitable skills to answer it, such that individual efforts are not wasted. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on multitask learning to learn the skills of participants of a forecasting platform by using their performance history. The learned model then can be used to recommend suitable questions to forecasters. Our experimental results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy can be increased based on the proposed algorithm as opposed to when questions have been randomly assigned.</p>
