    <h3>Recommending Personalised Targeted Training Adjustments for Marathon Runners (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ciara Feely, Aonghus Lawlor, Barry Smyth, Brian Caulfield</p>
    <p>Preparing for the marathon involves many weeks of dedicated training. Achieving the right balance between building strength and endurance and the need for rest and recovery is a must, if a runner is to arrive at the start-line injury-free and ready to achieve their desired finish-time. However, because most recreational runners rely on generic training plans, they can struggle to find this balance, which can impact their motivation, health, and performance. In this paper, we describe a novel case-based reasoning approach to fine-tuning a runner’s training by recommending training adjustments based on the patterns of similar runners at corresponding points in their marathon training. The approach is designed to target training adjustments that are based on similar runners but with varying race goals,  to allow runners to adjust their training for slower or faster finish-times, as their training progresses and motivations change. We evaluate the recommendations produced using a large-scale real-world dataset according to several factors including, (i) the plausibility of the recommended training adjustment, (ii) the effectiveness of the adjustment when it comes to achieving a particular performance goal, and (iii) the safety of the adjustment in terms of the degree of risk that it will lead to an injury or otherwise disrupt training. Our findings suggest that plausible, effective, and safe recommendations can be generated for runners when evaluated against a range of race goals.</p>

    <h3>BVAE: Behavior-aware Variational Autoencoder for Multi-Behavior Multi-Task Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Liu, Qianzhen Rao, Weike Pan, Zhong Ming</p>
    <p>A practical recommender system should be able to handle heterogeneous behavioral feedback as inputs and has multi-task outputs ability. Although the heterogeneous one-class collaborative filtering (HOCCF) and multi-task learning (MTL) methods has been well studied, there is still a lack of targeted manner in their combined fields, i.e., Multi-behavior Multi-task Recommendation (MMR). To fill the gap, we propose a novel recommendation framework called Behavior-aware Variational AutoEncoder (BVAE), which meliorates the parameter sharing and loss minimization method with the VAE structure to address the MMR problem. Specifically, our BVAE includes address behavior-aware semi-encoders and decoders, and a target feature fusion network with a global feature filtering network, while using standard deviation to weigh loss. These modules generate the behavior-aware recommended item list via constructing better semantic feature vectors for users, i.e., from dual perspectives of behavioral preference and global interaction. In addition, we optimize our BVAE in terms of adaptability and robustness, i.e., it is concise and flexible to consume any amount of behaviors with different distributions. Extensive empirical studies on two real and widely used datasets confirm the validity of our design and show that our BVAE can outperform the state-of-the-art related baseline methods under multiple evaluation metrics.</p>

    <h3>Retrieval-augmented Recommender System: Enhancing Recommender Systems with Large Language Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dario Di Palma</p>
    <p>Recommender Systems (RSs) play a pivotal role in delivering personalized recommendations across various domains, from e-commerce to content streaming platforms. Recent advancements in natural language processing have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. RS are renowned for their effectiveness and proficiency within clearly defined domains; nevertheless, they are limited in adaptability and incapable of providing recommendations for unexplored data. Conversely, LLMs exhibit contextual awareness and strong adaptability to unseen data. Combining these technologies creates a potent tool for delivering contextual and relevant recommendations, even in cold scenarios characterized by high data sparsity. The proposal aims to explore the possibilities of integrating LLMs into RS, introducing a novel approach called Retrieval-augmented Recommender Systems, which combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models to enhance the ability of RSs to provide relevant suggestions.</p>

    <h3>KA-Recsys: Knowledge Appropriate Patient Focused Recommendation Technologies (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khushboo Thaker</p>
    <p>Diseases such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease demand that patients take an active role in disease management and seek health information for decision-making and self-management [ 1]. The most common methods of providing reliable information to patients include health literacy workshops and patient education materials [12 , 15 ]. However, these materials are prepared for the general patient population and not always tailored to each patient’s specific needs [ 2, 12 ]. In addition, patients seek for their information needs through search engines. Previous studies have reported that search engines don’t always support information needs of patients [11 ]. Consequently, people seek information on disease specific online health communities (OHCs) [ 9 ]. But the risk of propagating misinformation still exists because existing OHCs do not provide an infrastructure to help patients find relevant and trustworthy information [ 8, 19 ].Existing patient focused health search engines and health recommender systems can accommodate better support of patients’ information needs by providing them trustworthy resources. However, current PHRS are personalized to patients’ interests and so information provided by these layperson-oriented systems is rather general [5, 6]. In fact, previous study has shown that a patient’s personal knowledge about their disease becomes more sophisticated over the course of disease [6 , 7]. Therefore, our principal motivation is to fill this gap in current PHRS, by investigating ways to suggest individualized health information that not only adapts to patients’ current information needs but also patients’ knowledge-level across the disease trajectory. The health materials recommended at the level of patients’ knowledge will not only help them engage with materials but also help in informed decision making and self management [16]. The goal of this research is to enhance state-of-the-art PHRS by exploring the technologies in the field of recommender systems and personalized learning so that PHRS can better suggest health information relevant to patients, which is appropriate to their changing knowledge level and in-line with their dynamic information need across their disease trajectory. Thus my research proposes a recommender that accommodates both patient interest and patient knowledge by integrating a patient knowledge model. The output of this research would be a knowledge-appropriate patient focused recommender system (KA-Recsys). As a case study, KA-Recsys will be implemented for ovarian cancer (OvCa) patients and integrated into HELPeR1.</p>

    <h3>Recommending in changing times (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manoj Nambiar, Amey Pandit, Rekha Singhal, Shruti Kunde, Shashank Gupta, Mayank Mishra, Gautam Shroff</p>
    <p>Recommender systems today face major challenges in keeping up with dynamic customer preferences. Disruptions or sudden changes in the environment affect customer preferences drastically and render historical data ineffective for modeling. With businesses relying heavily on Machine Learning(ML) based recommender systems for catering to customer preferences, the accuracy of timely recommendations gains prime significance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel concept, LDT (Labeled Data Threshold), a newly defined parameter to determine the sufficiency of available labeled training data. Our proposed scheme, using LDT leads to a significant reduction (  50X) in the training time for a model, thus enabling recommender systems to adapt quickly to disruptions. We illustrate the efficacy of our proposed scheme, by conducting extensive experimental analysis on six well known, structured data sets from various public domains.</p>

    <h3>Pace My Race: Recommendations for Marathon Running (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barry Smyth, Aonghus Lawlor, Jakim Berndsen</p>
    <p>We propose marathon running as a novel domain for recommender systems and machine learning. Using high-resolution marathon performance data from multiple marathon races (n=7931), we build in-race recommendations for runners. We show that we can outperform the existing techniques which are currently employed for in-race finish-time prediction, and we demonstrate how such predictions may be used to make real time recommendations to runners. The recommendations are made at critical points in the race to provide personalised guidance so the runner can adjust their race strategy. Through the association of model features and the expert domain knowledge of marathon runners we generate explainable, adaptable pacing recommendations which can guide runners to their best possible finish time and help them avoid the potentially catastrophic effects of hitting the wall.</p>
