    <h3>Improving Data Efficiency for Recommenders and LLMs (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Caverlee, Noveen Sachdeva, Jianmo Ni, Benjamin Coleman, Ed Chi, Lichan Hong, Wang-Cheng Kang, Derek Cheng</p>
    <p>In recent years, massive transformer-based architectures have driven breakthrough performance in practical applications like autoregressive text-generation (LLMs) and click-prediction (recommenders). A common recipe for success is to train large models on massive web-scale datasets, e.g., modern recommenders are trained on billions of user-item click events, and LLMs are trained on trillions of tokens extracted from the public internet. We are close to hitting the computational and economical limits of scaling up the size of these models, and we expect the next frontier of gains to come from improving the: (i) data quality of the training dataset, and (ii) data efficiency of the extremely expensive training procedure. Inspired by this shift, we present a set of “data-centric” techniques for recommendation and language models that summarizes a dataset into a terse data summary, which is both (i) high-quality, i.e., trains better quality models, and (ii) improves the data-efficiency of the overall training procedure. We propose techniques from two disparate data frameworks: (i) data selection (a.k.a., coreset construction) methods that sample portions of the dataset using grounded heuristics, and(ii) data distillation techniques that generate synthetic examples which are optimized to retain the signals needed for training high-quality models. Overall, this work sheds light on the challenges and opportunities offered by data optimization in web-scale systems, a particularly relevant focus as the recommendation community grapples with the grand challenge of leveraging LLMs.</p>

    <h3>Gradient Matching for Categorical Data Distillation in CTR Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixuan Li, Zhenhua Dong, Jiacheng Sun, Cheng Wang, Rui Zhang</p>
    <p>The cost of hardware and energy consumption on training a click-through rate (CTR) model is highly prohibitive. A recent promising direction for reducing such costs is data distillation with gradient matching, which aims to synthesize a small distilled dataset to guide the model to a similar parameter space as those trained on real data. However, there are two main challenges to implementing such a method in the recommendation field: (1) The categorical recommended data are high dimensional and sparse one- or multi-hot data which will block the gradient flow, causing backpropagation-based data distillation invalid. (2) The data distillation process with gradient matching is computationally expensive due to the bi-level optimization. To this end, we investigate efficient data distillation tailored for recommendation data with plenty of side information where we formulate the discrete data to the dense and continuous data format. Then, we further introduce a one-step gradient matching scheme, which performs gradient matching for only a single step to overcome the inefficient training process. The overall proposed method is called Categorical data distillation with Gradient Matching (CGM), which is capable of distilling a large dataset into a small of informative synthetic data for training CTR models from scratch. Experimental results show that our proposed method not only outperforms the state-of-the-art coreset selection and data distillation methods but also has remarkable cross-architecture performance. Moreover, we explore the application of CGM on continual updating and mitigate the effect of different random seeds on the training results.</p>
