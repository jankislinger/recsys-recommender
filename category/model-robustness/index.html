    <h3>Scale-Invariant Learning-to-Rank (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ye-Sheen Lim, Alessio Petrozziello, Xiaoke Liu, Christian Sommeregger</p>
    <p>At Expedia, learning-to-rank (LTR) models plays a key role on our website in sorting and presenting information more relevant to users, such as search filters, property rooms, amenities, and images. A major challenge in deploying these models is ensuring consistent feature scaling between training and production data, as discrepancies can lead to unreliable rankings when deployed. Normalization techniques like feature standardization and batch normalization could address these issues but are impractical in production due to latency impacts and the difficulty of distributed real-time inference. To address consistent feature scaling issue, we introduce a scale-invariant LTR framework which combines a deep and a wide neural network to mathematically guarantee scale-invariance in the model at both training and prediction time.</p>

    <h3>Beyond the Sequence: Statistics-driven Pre-training for Stabilizing Sequential Recommendation Model (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongzhi Zhang, Sirui Wang, Yunsen Xian, Peiguang Li</p>
    <p>The sequential recommendation task aims to predict the item that user is interested in according to his/her historical action sequence. However, inevitable random action, i.e. user randomly accesses an item among multiple candidates or clicks several items at random order, cause the sequence fails to provide stable and high-quality signals. To alleviate the issue, we propose the StatisTics-Driven Pre-traing framework (called STDP briefly). The main idea of the work lies in the exploration of utilizing the statistics information along with the pre-training paradigm to stabilize the optimization of recommendation model. Specifically, we derive two types of statistical information: item co-occurrence across sequence and attribute frequency within the sequence. And we design the following pre-training tasks: 1) The co-occurred items prediction task, which encourages the model to distribute its attention on multiple suitable targets instead of just focusing on the next item that may be unstable. 2) We generate a paired sequence by replacing items with their co-occurred items and enforce its representation close with the original one, thus enhancing the model’s robustness to the random noise. 3) To reduce the impact of random on user’s long-term preferences, we encourage the model to capture sequence-level frequent attributes. The significant improvement over six datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposal, and further analysis verified the generalization of the STDP framework on other models.</p>

    <h3>Denoising Explicit Social Signals for Robust Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youchen Sun</p>
    <p>Social recommender system assumes that user’s preferences can be influenced by their social connections. However, social networks are inherently noisy and contain redundant signals that are not helpful or even harmful for the recommendation task. In this extended abstract, we classify the noise in the explicit social links into intrinsic noise and extrinsic noise. Intrinsic noises are those edges that are natural in the social network but do not have an influence on the user preference modeling; Extrinsic noises, on the other hand, are those social links that are introduced intentionally through malicious attacks such that the attackers can manipulate the social influence to bias the recommendation outcome. To tackle this issue, we first propose a denoising framework that utilizes the information bottleneck principle and contrastive learning to filter out the noisy social edges and use the edges that are socially influential to enhance item prediction. Experiments will be conducted on the real-world datasets for the Top-K ranking evaluation as well as the model’s robustness to simulated social noises. Finally, we discuss the future plan about how to defend against extrinsic noise, which results from the malicious attack.</p>

    <h3>Making the Most of Preference Feedback by Modeling Feature Dependencies (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sutanu Chakraborty, S Chandra Mouli</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems help users navigate through the product space by exploiting feedback. In conversational systems based on preference-based feedback, the user selects the most preferred item from a list of recommended products. Modelling user’s preferences then becomes important in order to recommend relevant items. Several existing recommender systems accomplish this by assuming the features to be independent. Here we will attempt to forego this assumption and exploit the dependencies between the features to build a robust user preference model.</p>
