    <h3>User knowledge prompt for sequential recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuuki Tachioka</p>
    <p>The large language model (LLM) based recommendation system is effective for sequential recommendation, because general knowledge of popular items is included in the LLM. To add domain knowledge of items, the conventional method uses a knowledge prompt obtained from the item knowledge graphs and has achieved SOTA performance. However, for personalized recommendation, it is necessary to consider user knowledge, which the conventional method does not fully consider because user knowledge is not included in the item knowledge graphs; thus, we propose a user knowledge prompt, which converts a user knowledge graph into a prompt using the relationship template. The existing prompt denoising framework is extended to prevent hallucination caused by undesirable interactions between knowledge graph prompts. We propose user knowledge prompts of user traits and user preferences and associate relevant items. Experiments on three types of dataset (movie, music, and book) show the significant and consistent improvement of our proposed user knowledge prompt.</p>

    <h3>TALLRec: An Effective and Efficient Tuning Framework to Align Large Language Model with Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keqin Bao, Jizhi Zhang, Xiangnan He, Fuli Feng, Wenjie Wang, Yang Zhang</p>
    <p>The impressive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various fields has encouraged researchers to investigate their potential in recommendation tasks. To harness the LLMs’ extensive knowledge and powerful generalization abilities, initial efforts have tried to design instructions for recommendation tasks through In-context Learning. However, the recommendation performance of LLMs remains limited due to (i) significant differences between LLMs’ language-related pre-training tasks and recommendation tasks, and (ii) inadequate recommendation data during the LLMs’ pre-training. To fill the gap, we consider further tuning LLMs for recommendation tasks. To this end, we propose a lightweight tuning framework for LLMs-based recommendation, namely LLM4Rec, which constructs the recommendation data as tuning samples and utilizes LoRA for lightweight tuning. We conduct experiments on two datasets, validating that LLM4Rec is highly efficient w.r.t. computing costs (e.g., a single RTX 3090 is sufficient for tuning LLaMA-7B), and meanwhile, it can significantly enhance the recommendation capabilities of LLMs in the movie and book domains, even with limited tuning samples (< 100 samples). Furthermore, LLM4Rec exhibits strong generalization ability in cross-domain recommendation. Our code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM4rec.</p>

    <h3>Challenging the Myth of Graph Collaborative Filtering: a Reasoned and Reproducibility-driven Analysis (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Pomo, Eugenio Di Sciascio, Daniele Malitesta, Tommaso Di Noia, Vito Walter Anelli, Alejandro Bellogin</p>
    <p>Among the most successful research directions in recommender systems, there are undoubtedly graph neural network-based models (GNNs). Through the natural modeling of users and items as a bipartite, undirected graph, GNNs have pushed up the performance bar for modern recommenders. Unfortunately, most of the original graph-based works cherry-pick results from previous baseline papers without bothering to check whether the results are valid for the configuration under analysis. Thus, our work stands first and foremost as a work on the replicability of results. We provide a code that succeeds in replicating the results proposed in the articles introducing six of the most popular and recent graph recommendation models (i.e., NGCF, DGCF, LightGCN, SGL, UltraGCN, and GFCF). In our experimental setup, we test these six models on three common benchmarking datasets (i.e., Gowalla, Yelp 2018, and Amazon Book). In addition, to understand how these models perform with respect to traditional models for collaborative filtering, we compare the graph models under analysis with some models that have historically emerged as the best performers in an offline evaluation context. Then, the study is extended on two new datasets (i.e., Allrecipes and BookCrossing) for which no known setup exists in the literature. Since the performance on such datasets is not entirely aligned with the previous benchmarking one, we further analyze the possible impact of specific dataset characteristics on the recommendation accuracy performance. By investigating the information flow to the users from their neighborhoods, the analysis aims to identify for which models these intrinsic features in the dataset structure impact accuracy performance. The code to reproduce the experiments is available at: https://split.to/Graph-Reproducibility.</p>

    <h3>Modeling User Repeat Consumption Behavior for Online Novel Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cunxiang Yin, Leeven Luo, Yuncong Li, Yancheng He, Guoqiang Xu, Jing Cai, Sheng-hua Zhong</p>
    <p>Given a user’s historical interaction sequence, online novel recommendation suggests the next novel the user may be interested in. Online novel recommendation is important but underexplored. In this paper, we concentrate on recommending online novels to new users of an online novel reading platform, whose first visits to the platform occurred in the last seven days. We have two observations about online novel recommendation for new users. First, repeat novel consumption of new users is a common phenomenon. Second, interactions between users and novels are informative. To accurately predict whether a user will reconsume a novel, it is crucial to characterize each interaction at a fine-grained level. Based on these two observations, we propose a neural network for online novel recommendation, called NovelNet. NovelNet can recommend the next novel from both the user’s consumed novels and new novels simultaneously. Specifically, an interaction encoder is used to obtain accurate interaction representation considering fine-grained attributes of interaction, and a pointer network with a pointwise loss is incorporated into NovelNet to recommend previously-consumed novels. Moreover, an online novel recommendation dataset is built from a well-known online novel reading platform and is released for public use as a benchmark. Experimental results on the dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of NovelNet 1.</p>

    <h3>Towards Source-Aligned Variational Models for Cross-Domain Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aghiles Salah, Hady Lauw, Thanh Binh Tran</p>
    <p>Data sparsity is a long-standing challenge in recommender systems. Among existing approaches to alleviate this problem, cross-domain recommendation consists in leveraging knowledge from a source domain or category (e.g., Movies) to improve item recommendation in a target domain (e.g., Books). In this work, we advocate a probabilistic approach to cross-domain recommendation and rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) as our latent variable models. More precisely, we assume that we have access to a VAE trained on the source domain that we seek to leverage to improve preference modeling in the target domain. To this end, we propose a model which learns to fit the target observations and align its hidden space with the source latent space jointly. Since we model the latent spaces by the variational posteriors, we operate at this level, and in particular, we investigate two approaches, namely rigid and soft alignments. In the former scenario, the variational model in the target domain is set equal to the source variational model. That is, we only learn a generative model in the target domain. In the soft-alignment scenario, the target VAE has its variational model, but which is encouraged to look like its source counterpart. We analyze the proposed objectives theoretically and conduct extensive experiments to illustrate the benefit of our contribution. Empirical results on six real-world datasets show that the proposed models outperform several comparable cross-domain recommendation models.</p>

    <h3>Don’t Judge a Book by its Cover: Exploring Book Traits Children Favor (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashlee Milton, Levesson Batista, Siqi Gao, Yiu-Kai Ng, Garrett Allen, Maria Soledad Pera</p>
    <p>We present the preliminary exploration we conducted to identify traits that can influence children’s preferences in books.

    <h3>What does BERT know about books, movies and music? Probing BERT for Conversational Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudia Hauff, Gustavo Penha</p>
    <p>Heavily pre-trained transformer models such as BERT have recently shown to be remarkably powerful at language modelling, achieving impressive results on numerous downstream tasks. It has also been shown that they implicitly store factual knowledge in their parameters after pre-training. Understanding what the pre-training procedure of LMs actually learns is a crucial step for using and improving them for Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS). We first study how much off-the-shelf pre-trained BERT “knows” about recommendation items such as books, movies and music. In order to analyze the knowledge stored in BERT’s parameters, we use different probes (i.e., tasks to examine a trained model regarding certain properties) that require different types of knowledge to solve, namely content-based and collaborative-based. Content-based knowledge is knowledge that requires the model to match the titles of items with their content information, such as textual descriptions and genres. In contrast, collaborative-based knowledge requires the model to match items with similar ones, according to community interactions such as ratings. We resort to BERT’s Masked Language Modelling (MLM) head to probe its knowledge about the genre of items, with cloze style prompts. In addition, we employ BERT’s Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) head and representations’ similarity (SIM) to compare relevant and non-relevant search and recommendation query-document inputs to explore whether BERT can, without any fine-tuning, rank relevant items first. Finally, we study how BERT performs in a conversational recommendation downstream task. To this end, we fine-tune BERT to act as a retrieval-based CRS. Overall, our experiments show that: (i) BERT has knowledge stored in its parameters about the content of books, movies and music; (ii) it has more content-based knowledge than collaborative-based knowledge; and (iii) fails on conversational recommendation when faced with adversarial data.</p>

    <h3>Auto-Surprise: An Automated Recommender-System (AutoRecSys) Library with Tree of Parzens Estimator (TPE) Optimization (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohan Anand, Joeran Beel</p>
    <p>We introduce Auto-Surprise1, an automated recommender system library. Auto-Surprise is an extension of the Surprise recommender system library and eases the algorithm selection and configuration process. Compared to an out-of-the-box Surprise library, without hyper parameter optimization, AutoSurprise performs better, when evaluated with MovieLens, Book Crossing and Jester datasets. It may also result in the selection of an algorithm with significantly lower runtime. Compared to Surprise’s grid search, Auto-Surprise performs equally well or slightly better in terms of RMSE, and is notably faster in finding the optimum hyperparameters.</p>

    <h3>ClusterExplorer: Enable User Control over Related Recommendations via Collaborative Filtering and Clustering (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kati Launis, Denis Kotkov, Mats Neovius, Qian Zhao</p>
    <p>Related item recommendations have a long history in recommender systems, but they tend to be a static list of similar items with respect to a target item of interest without any support of user control. In this paper, we propose ClusterExplorer, a novel approach for enabling user control over related recommendations. The approach allows users to explore the latent space of user-item interactions through controlling related recommendations. We evaluated ClusterExplorer in the book domain with 42 participants recruited in a public library and found that our approach has higher user satisfaction of browsing items and is more helpful in finding interesting items compared to traditional related item recommendations.</p>

    <h3>User Preferences in Recommendation Algorithms: The Influence of User Diversity, Trust, and Product Category on Privacy Perceptions in Recommender Algorithms (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> André Calero Valdez, Johannes Nakayama, Martina Ziefle, Nils Plettenberg, Laura Burbach</p>
    <p>The use of recommendation systems is widespread in online commerce. Depending on the algorithm that is used in the recommender system different types of data are recorded from user interactions. Typically better recommendations are achieved when more detailed data about the user and product is available. However, users are often unaware of what data is stored and how it is used in recommendation. In a survey study with 197 participants we introduced different recommendation techniques (collaborative filtering, content-based recommendation, trust-based and social recommendation) to the users and asked participants to rate what type of algorithm should be used for what type of product category (books, mobile phones, contraceptives). We found different patterns of preferences for different product categories. The more sensitive the product the higher the preference for content-based filtering approaches that could work without storing personal data. Trust-based and social approaches utilizing data from social media were generally rejected.</p>

    <h3>Automating Readers’ Advisory to Make Book Recommendations for K-12 Readers (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Pera, Yiu-Kai Ng</p>
    <p>The academic performance of students is affected by their reading ability, which explains why reading is one of the most important aspects of school curriculums. Promot- ing good reading habits among K-12 students is essential, given the enormous influence of reading on students’ de- velopment as learners and members of society. In doing so, it is indispensable to provide readers with engaging and motivating reading selections. Unfortunately, existing book recommenders have failed to offer adequate choices for K- 12 readers, since they either ignore the reading abilities of their users or cannot acquire the much-needed information to make recommendations due to privacy issues. To address these problems, we have developed Rabbit, a book recom- mender that emulates the readers’ advisory service offered at school/public libraries. Rabbit considers the readability levels of its readers and determines the facets, i.e., appeal factors, of books that evoke subconscious, emotional reac- tions on a reader. The design of Rabbit is unique, since it adopts a multi-dimensional approach to capture the reading abilities, preferences, and interests of its readers, which goes beyond the traditional book content/topical analysis. Con- ducted empirical studies have shown that Rabbit outper- forms a number of (readability-based) book recommenders.</p>

    <h3>Coverage, Redundancy and Size-Awareness in Genre Diversity for Recommender Systems (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saul Vargas, Pablo Castells, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Linas Baltrunas</p>
    <p>There is increasing awareness in the Recommender Systems field that diversity is as a key property that enhances the usefulness of recommendations. Genre information can serve as a means to measure and enhance the diversity of recommendations and is readily available in domains such as movies, music or books. In this work we propose a new Binomial framework for defining genre diversity in recommender systems that takes into account three key properties: genre coverage, genre redundancy and recommendation list size-awareness. We show that methods previously proposed for measuring and enhancing recommendation diversity -including those adapted from search result diversification- fail to address adequately these three properties. We also propose an efficient greedy optimization technique to optimize Binomial diversity. Experiments with the Netflix dataset show the properties of our framework and comparison with state of the art methods.</p>
