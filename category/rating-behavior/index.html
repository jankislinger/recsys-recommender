    <h3>Exploring the Value of Personality in Predicting Rating Behaviors: A Study of Category Preferences on MovieLens (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph A. Konstan, Raghav Pavan Karumur, Tien T. Nguyen</p>
    <p>Prior work relevant to incorporating personality into recommender systems falls into two categories: social science studies and algorithmic ones. Social science studies of preference have found only small relationships between personality and category preferences, whereas, algorithmic approaches found a little improvement when incorporating personality into recommendations. As a result, despite good reasons to believe personality assessments should be useful in recommenders, we are left with no substantial demonstrated impact. In this work, we start with user data from a live recommender system, but study category-by-category variations in preference (both rating levels and distribution) across different personality types. By doing this, we hope to isolate specific areas where personality is most likely to provide value in recommender systems, while also modeling an analytic process that can be used in other domains. After controlling for the family-wise error rate, we find that High Agreeableness users rate at least 0.5 stars higher on a 5-star scale compared to low Agreeableness users. We also find differences in consumption in four different personality types between people who manifested high and low levels of that personality.</p>

    <h3>Asymmetric Recommendations: The Interacting Effects of Social Ratings’ Direction and Strength on Users’ Ratings (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oded Nov, Ofer Arazy</p>
    <p>In social recommendation systems, users often publicly rate objects such as photos, news articles or consumer products. When they appear in aggregate, these ratings carry social signals such as the direction and strength of the raters’ average opinion about the product. Using a controlled experiment we manipulated two central social signals – the direction and strength of social ratings of five popular consumer products – and examined their interacting effects on users’ ratings. The results show an asymmetric user behavior, where the direction of perceived social rating has a negative effect on users’ ratings if the direction of perceived social rating is negative, but no effect if the direction is positive. The strength of perceived social ratings did not have a significant effect on users’ ratings. The findings highlight the potential for cascading adverse effects of small number of negative user ratings on subsequent users’ opinions.</p>
