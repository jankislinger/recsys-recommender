    <h3>RPAF: A Reinforcement Prediction-Allocation Framework for Cache Allocation in Large-Scale Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiqiao Zhan, Kun Gai, Xiaoshuang Chen, Yao Wang, Ziqiang Zhang, Ben Wang, Yulin Wu, Shuo Su</p>
    <p>Modern recommender systems are built upon computation-intensive infrastructure, and it is challenging to perform real-time computation for each request, especially in peak periods, due to the limited computational resources. Recommending by user-wise result caches is widely used when the system cannot afford a real-time recommendation. However, it is challenging to allocate real-time and cached recommendations to maximize the users’ overall engagement. This paper shows two key challenges to cache allocation, i.e., the temporal dependency and the streaming allocation. Then, we propose a reinforcement prediction-allocation framework (RPAF) to address these issues. RPAF is a reinforcement-learning-based two-stage framework containing prediction and allocation stages. The prediction stage estimates the values of the cache choices considering the strategy and value dependencies, while the allocation stage determines the cache choices for each request. We show that the challenge of training RPAF includes globality and the strictness of budget constraints, and a relaxed local allocator (RLA) is proposed to address this issue. Moreover, a PoolRank algorithm is used in the allocation stage to deal with the streaming allocation problem. Experiments show that RPAF significantly improves users’ engagement under computational budget constraints.</p>

    <h3>User-Centric Conversational Recommendation: Adapting the Need of User with Large Language Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gangyi Zhang</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) promise to provide a more natural user experience for exploring and discovering items of interest through ongoing conversation. However, effectively modeling user preferences during conversations and generating personalized recommendations in real time remain challenging problems. Users often express their needs in a vague and evolving manner, and CRS must adapt to capture the dynamics and uncertainty in user preferences to have productive interactions. This research develops user-centric methods for building conversational recommendation system that can understand complex and changing user needs. We propose a graph-based conversational recommendation framework that represents multi-turn conversations as reasoning over a user-item-attribute graph. Enhanced conversational path reasoning incorporates graph neural networks to improve representation learning in this framework. To address uncertainty and dynamics in user preferences, we present the vague preference multi-round conversational recommendation scenario and an adaptive vague preference policy learning solution that employs reinforcement learning to determine recommendation and preference elicitation strategies tailored to the user. Looking to the future, large language models offer promising opportunities to enhance various aspects of CRS, including user modeling, policy learning, response generation.  Overall, this research takes a user-centered perspective in designing conversational agents that can adapt to the inherent ambiguity involved in natural language dialogues with people.</p>

    <h3>Recommendations: They’re in fashion (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiago Lacerda, Diogo Gonçalves, Carlos Carvalheira</p>
    <p>Farfetch, the leading online platform for luxury fashion, has spent several years developing a recommender system. In fact, recommendations have been quite successful in improving both the user experience and the company’s own business metrics [3 – 9]. In this talk we will shed some light on how we built our recommender system at Farfetch, the main obstacles we faced, and some plans for the future. Recommendations started their journey at Farfetch somewhere around 2015. At the time, we had a single model that trained once per day that updated the users’ recommendations with the same frequency. Currently, we have around 20 models in production and the majority of them are designed to handle streaming data from the users and adapt in realtime to user actions. How can we balance training and improving existing models, creating new models, serving them in real time and still keep our code in check, our tests up to date and our pipelines moving? We will discuss the three main components that we created in order to tackle our real world issue of providing ever-improving recommendations to our customers: The Gym, The Recommenders and The API. The Gym (Fig. 1) is the place where model training takes place. Inspired by the gyms from Open-AI and Criteo [ 1, 2], it mixes Spark and Python according to what we need to process. It has three main goals. Process the data that is going to feed the models, train the models, and evaluate the models. The Gym is equipped to handle every model from deep neural networks to simple collaborative models. It provides a fluid platform for multi model creation. The Recommenders (Fig. 2) define the common structure and interface for each recommender model. From applying the literature and our own experience, we found a predetermined behaviour that every recommendation follows, even though the models can be quite different from one another. It’s the individual components of a specific recommender that change. The components determine which products or brands are the candidates for a recommendation, what the right context for the recommendation is and how to score the candidates in light of the context. We can then mix and match these components to achieve the right recommender model. The Recommenders define these components and the common path that uses them. It’s Strategy Pattern all the way down. The API (Fig. 3), which we call Precog, loads and serves the models previously trained in The Gym and defined in The Recommenders. Every request made to this application triggers an execution for the particular context of the request, which means we can deliver highly personalized and context-aware recommendations. Since every recommender model is defined as implementing a recommend method, the API is simultaneously flexible in the variety of models it handles, but also quite unconcerned with the specific implementation of a recommender model and the libraries/packages needed to train it. Finally, with this presentation, we aim to give an overview and understanding of our recommendations cycle, going in detail about how these three components communicate among them. The final goal is to give a personalised experience to our customers, which given the luxury ecosystem in which Farfetch is involved, has high demands and expectations associated with it.</p>

    <h3>CAEN: A Hierarchically Attentive Evolution Network for Item-Attribute-Change-Aware Recommendation in the Growing E-commerce Environment (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingsong Yuan, Rui Ma, Jiandong Zhang, Huafeng Yang, Ning Liu</p>
    <p>Traditional recommendation systems mainly focus on modeling user interests. However, the dynamics of recommended items caused by attribute modifications (e.g. changes in prices) are also of great importance in real systems, especially in the fast-growing e-commerce environment, which may cause the users’ demands to emerge, shift and disappear. Recent studies that make efforts on dynamic item representations treat the item attributes as side information but ignore its temporal dependency, or model the item evolution with a sequence of related users but do not consider item attributes. In this paper, we propose Core Attribute Evolution Network (CAEN), which partitions the user sequence according to the attribute value and thus models the item evolution over attribute dynamics with these users. Under this framework, we further devise a hierarchical attention mechanism that applies attribute-aware attention for user aggregation under each attribute, as well as personalized attention for activating similar users in assessing the matching degree between target user and item. Results from the extensive experiments over actual e-commerce datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-art methods and achieves significant improvements on the items with rapid changes over attributes, therefore helping the item recommendation to adapt to the growth of the e-commerce platform.</p>

    <h3>Reducing Energy Waste in Households Through Real-Time Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iraklis Varlamis, Akshay Anil Pagar, Janhavi Dahihande, Ajinkya Thakare, Magdalini Eirinaki, Akshay Anil Jaiswal</p>
    <p>The energy consumption of households has steadily increased over the last couple of decades. Research suggests that user behavior is the most influential factor in the energy waste of a household. Thus, there’s a need for helping consumers change their behavior to make it more energy efficient and environment friendly. In this work we propose a real-time recommender system that assists consumers in improving their household’s energy usage. By monitoring the power demand of each appliance in the household, the system detects the device status (on/off) at any moment, and using pattern mining creates a household profile comprising energy consumption patterns for different periods of the day. An intuitive UI allows users to set energy consumption goals and preferences on the appliances they’d like to save energy from. Based on the household profile, the user’s preferences and the actual power demand the system generates personalized real-time recommendations on which appliances should be turned off at a moment. We employ the UK-DALE (UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity) dataset to model and evaluate the entire process, from data preprocessing and transformation of the appliance power demand input to various pattern mining algorithms used to generate appliance usage profiles and recommendations, showing that even small changes in appliance usage behavior can lead to energy savings between 2-17%.</p>

    <h3>On the Heterogeneous Information Needs in the Job Domain: A Unified Platform for Student Career (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Reiter-Haas</p>
    <p>Finding the right job is a difficult task for anyone as it usually depends on many factors like salary, job description, or geographical location. Students with almost no prior experience, especially, have a hard time on the job market, which is very competitive in nature. Additionally, students often suffer a lack of orientation, as they do not know what kind of job is suitable for their education. At Talto1, we realized this and have built a platform to help Austrian university students with finding their career paths as well as providing them with content that is relevant to their career possibilities. This is mainly achieved by guiding the students toward different types of entities that are related to their career, i.e., job postings, company profiles, and career-related articles.<br>In this talk, we share our experiences with solving the recommendation problem for university students. One trait of the student-focused job domain is that behaviour of the students differs depending on their study progression. At the beginning of their studies, they need study-specific career information and part-time jobs to earn additional money. Whereas, when they are nearing graduation, they require information about their potential future employers and entry-level full-time jobs. Moreover, we can observe seasonal patterns in user activity in addition to the need of handling both logged-in and anonymous session users at the same time.<br>To cope with the requirements of the job domain, we built hybrid models based on a microservice architecture that utilizes popular algorithms from the literature such as Collaborative Filtering, Content-based Filtering as well as various neural embedding approaches (e.g., Doc2Vec, Autoencoders, etc.). We further adapted our architecture to calculate relevant recommendations in real-time (i.e., after a recommendation is requested) as individual user sessions in Talto are usually short-lived and context-dependent. Here we found that the online performance of the utilized approach also depends on the location context [1]. Hence, the current location of a user on the mobile or web application impacts the expected recommendations.<br>One optimization criterion on the Talto career platform is to provide relevant cross-entity recommendations as well as explain why those were shown. Recently, we started to tackle this by learning embeddings of entities that lie in the same embedding space [2]. Specifically, we pre-train word embeddings and link different entities by shared concepts, which we use for training the network embeddings. This embeds both the concepts and the entities into a common vector space, where the common vector space is a result of considering the textual content, as well as the network information (i.e., links to concepts). This way, different entity types (e.g., job postings, company profiles, and articles) are directly comparable and are suited for a real-time recommendation setting. Interestingly enough, with such an approach we also end up with individual words sharing the same embedding space. This, in turn, can be leveraged to enhance the textual search functionality of a platform, which is most commonly based just on a TF-IDF model.<br>Furthermore, we found that such embeddings allow us to tackle the problem of explainability in an algorithm-agnostic way. Since the Talto platform utilizes various recommendation algorithms as well as continuously conducts AB tests, an algorithm-agnostic explainability model would be best suited to provide the students with meaningful explanations. As such, we will also go into the details on how we can adapt our explanation model to not rely on the utilized recommendation algorithm.</p>

    <h3>Multi-Armed Recommender System Bandit Ensembles (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcos Redondo, Rocío Cañamares, Pablo Castells</p>
    <p>It has long been found that well-configured recommender system ensembles can achieve better effectiveness than the combined systems separately. Sophisticated approaches have been developed to automatically optimize the ensembles’ configuration to maximize their performance gains. However most work in this area has targeted simplified scenarios where algorithms are tested and compared on a single non-interactive run. In this paper we consider a more realistic perspective bearing in mind the cyclic nature of the recommendation task, where a large part of the system’s input is collected from the reaction of users to the recommendations they are delivered. The cyclic process provides the opportunity for ensembles to observe and learn about the effectiveness of the combined algorithms, and improve the ensemble configuration progressively. In this paper we explore the adaptation of a multi-armed bandit approach to achieve this, by representing the combined systems as arms, and the ensemble as a bandit that at each step selects an arm to produce the next round of recommendations. We report experiments showing the effectiveness of this approach compared to ensembles that lack the iterative perspective. Along the way, we find illustrative pitfall examples that can result from common, single-shot offline evaluation setups. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Pace My Race: Recommendations for Marathon Running (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barry Smyth, Aonghus Lawlor, Jakim Berndsen</p>
    <p>We propose marathon running as a novel domain for recommender systems and machine learning. Using high-resolution marathon performance data from multiple marathon races (n=7931), we build in-race recommendations for runners. We show that we can outperform the existing techniques which are currently employed for in-race finish-time prediction, and we demonstrate how such predictions may be used to make real time recommendations to runners. The recommendations are made at critical points in the race to provide personalised guidance so the runner can adjust their race strategy. Through the association of model features and the expert domain knowledge of marathon runners we generate explainable, adaptable pacing recommendations which can guide runners to their best possible finish time and help them avoid the potentially catastrophic effects of hitting the wall.</p>

    <p>In this work, we present the findings of an online study, where we explore the impact of utilizing embeddings to recommend job postings under real-time constraints. On the Austrian job platform Studo Jobs, we evaluate two popular recommendation scenarios: (i) providing similar jobs and, (ii) personalizing the job postings that are shown on the homepage. Our results show that for recommending similar jobs, we achieve the best online performance in terms of Click-Through Rate when we employ embeddings based on the most recent interaction. To personalize the job postings shown on a user’s homepage, however, combining embeddings based on the frequency and recency with which a user interacts with job postings results in the best online performance. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <p>CheckInShop is an app that employs sensors to capture the user preferences  in physical stores and provide either micro-location marketing or product recommendations. By utilizing iBeacon technology and with the exploitation of a mobile app, we keep track of customer’s preferences in physical stores. Then, based on the time that a product is viewed by a customer and his micro-location inside the store, we send to him either product offers or recommendations of similar products to the ones he is looking at. These recommendations are accurate because they are provided at the right time and in the right place.</p>

    <h3>Using Navigation to Improve Recommendations in Real-Time (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander J Smola, Justin Basilico, Christopher V Alvino, Chao-Yuan Wu</p>
    <p>Implicit feedback is a key source of information for many recommendation and personalization approaches. However, using it typically requires multiple episodes of interaction and roundtrips to a recommendation engine. This adds latency and neglects the opportunity of immediate personalization for a user the user is navigating recommendations. We propose a novel strategy to address the above problem in a principled manner. The key insight is that as we observe a user’s interactions, it reveals much more information about her desires. We exploit this by inferring the within-session user intent based on navigation interactions, since they offer valuable clues into a user’s current state of mind. Using navigation patterns and adapting recommendations in real-time creates an opportunity to provide more accurate recommendations. By prefetching a larger amount of content, this can be carried out entirely in the client (such as a browser) without added latency. We define a new Bayesian model with an efficient inference algorithm. We demonstrate significant improvements with this novel approach on a real-world, large-scale dataset from Netflix on the problem of adapting the recommendations on a user’s homepage.</p>

    <h3>Parallel Recurrent Neural Network Architectures for Feature-rich Session-based Recommendations (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Domonkos Tikk, Balázs Hidasi, Massimo Quadrana, Alexandros Karatzoglou</p>
    <p>Real-life recommender systems often face the daunting task of providing recommendations based only on the clicks of a user session. Methods that rely on user profiles — such as matrix factorization — perform very poorly in this setting, thus item-to-item recommendations are used most of the time. However the items typically have rich feature representations such as pictures and text descriptions that can be used to model the sessions. Here we investigate how these features can be exploited in Recurrent Neural Network based session models using deep learning. We show that obvious approaches do not leverage these data sources. We thus introduce a number of parallel RNN (p-RNN) architectures to model sessions based on the clicks and the features (images and text) of the clicked items. We also propose alternative training strategies for p-RNNs that suit them better than standard training. We show that p-RNN architectures with proper training have significant performance improvements over feature-less session models while all session-based models outperform the item-to-item type baseline.</p>

    <p>This paper tackles the problem of recommendations in eBay’s large semi-structured marketplace. eBay’s variable inventory and lack of structured information about listings makes traditional collaborative filtering algorithms difficult to use. We discuss how to overcome these data limitations to produce high quality recommendations in real time with a combination of a customized scalable architecture as well as a widely applicable machine learned ranking model. A pointwise ranking approach is utilized to reduce the ranking problem to a binary classification problem optimized on past user purchase behavior. We present details of a sampling strategy and feature engineering that have been critical to achieve a lift in both purchase through rate (PTR) and revenue.</p>

    <h3>Configuring and Monitoring Recommender System as a Service (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Tsikinovsky, Johannes Hörle, David Ben-Shimon, Michael Friedman</p>
    <p>Many small and medium e-commerce retailers and publishers use recommender systems (RS) to personalize the website content. Many of them do not have an on premise solution for doing that, but rather contact a company that delivers the RS as a service to their website. The service is then responsible for collecting and storing the data, building recommendation models, and answering recommendation requests.<br>Once the integration to such a service is done, the e-commerce retailer still wish to have some control on the service. Control that allows him to configure the recommendation models, turn off/on the service, apply filters on recommendations, define fallback models and more. In this demo we provide an overview of a real backend system which enables to a typical website owner exactly these capabilities.

    <h3>Tell Me Where to Go and What to Do Next, but Do Not Bother Me (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Liu, Gang Wu</p>
    <p>In this demonstration, we present a system that recommends to the user the locations and activities she/he might be interested in according to history GPS trajectories and public places of interest (POI) data. Its innovation lies in the acceptable performance of recommendations in cases where no user comments on activity types are available. Such situations are more realistic considering the restrictions on mobile devices' abilities, users' privacies, or business secret. For this purpose, we first extract stay points according to uses' trajectories, and label them with the top-k common activities which have the most possibility in terms of the POI dataset. Then, by taking stay points as observations, and activities as hidden states, a Hidden Markov model is built to learn the transfer possibilities between activities and the generation probabilities between activities and stay points. Finally, with the obtained model, our system can perform two types of recommendation, i.e. the history based recommendation and the similarity based recommendation. The results of former type are those stay points from user's own history positions. While, the latter one conducts collaborative filtering by taking history based recommendation results from similar users. The demonstration shows the running effects of the implemented prototype system, in which the Microsoft GeoLife trajectories dataset and the "DianPing.com" POI dataset were loaded. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate the feasibility.</p>

    <h3>Speeding Up the Xbox Recommender System Using a Euclidean Transformation for Inner-Product Spaces (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ulrich Paquet, Noam Koenigstein, Nir Nice, Ran Gilad-Bachrach, Liran Katzir, Yoram Bachrach, Yehuda Finkelstein</p>
    <p>A prominent approach in collaborative filtering based recommender systems is using dimensionality reduction (matrix factorization) techniques to map users and items into low-dimensional vectors. In such systems, a higher inner product between a user vector and an item vector indicates that the item better suits the user’s preference. Traditionally, retrieving the most suitable items was done by scoring and sorting all items. Real world online recommender systems must adhere to strict response-time constraints. Therefore, when the number of items is too large, scoring all items becomes infeasible. We propose a novel order preserving transformation, mapping the maximum inner product search problem to Euclidean space nearest neighbor search problem. Utilizing this transformation, we study the efficiency of several (approximate) nearest neighbor data structures. Our final solution is based on a novel use of the PCA-Tree data structure in which results are augmented using paths one hamming distance away from the query (neighborhood boosting). The end result is a system which allows approximate matches (items with relatively high inner product, but not necessarily the highest one). We evaluate our techniques on two large-scale recommendation datasets, Xbox Movies and Yahoo~Music, and show that this technique allow trading off a slight degradation in the recommendation quality for a significant improvement in the retrieval time.</p>
