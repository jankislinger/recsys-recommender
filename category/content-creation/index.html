    <h3>Optimizing for Participation in Recommender System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourabh Bansod, Yaping Zhang, Bibang Liu, Mingyan Gao, Yuan Shao, Arnab Bhadury</p>
    <p>The traditional recommender system has been designed to mostly optimize for viewer consumption, and with the rise of short form videos, the boundaries between consumption and participation have blurred. This shift presents an opportunity to optimize recommender systems not only for passive consumption, but also for active participation in content creation. In this paper, we document the development of a recommender system that provides inspiration to existing content uploaders and new future content uploaders to encourage participation. Our contributions are two-fold: 1) Inspiration Framework: We present a novel framework for building a recommender system that goes beyond traditional consumption-focused metrics, specifically addressing the need for creative inspiration to lower barriers for participation. This framework is adaptable in the design of large-scale recommender systems in other domains. 2) Empirical Evaluation: We conduct systematic evaluation via live experiments to prove the values of the proposed system in increasing daily participation and participants.</p>

    <h3>Co-optimize Content Generation and Consumption in a Large Scale Video Recommendation System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuening Li, Mingyan Gao, Qingyun Liu, Sourabh Bansod, Shuchao Bi, Liang Liu, Yaping Zhang, Zhen Zhang</p>
    <p>Multi-task prediction models and value models are the de-facto standard ranking components in modern large-scale content recommendation systems. However, they are typically optimized to model users’ passive consumption behaviors, and rank content in a way to grow only consumption-centric values. In this talk, we discuss the key insight that it is possible to model sparse participatory content-generation actions as well and grow ecosystem value through a new ranking system. We made the following key technical contributions in this system: (1) introducing ranking for content generation based on a categorization of user participation actions of different sparsity, including proxy intent action or access point clicks. (2) improving sparse task prediction quality and stability by causal task relationship modeling, conditional loss modeling and ResNet based shared bottom network. (3) personalizing the value model to minimize conflicts between different values, through e.g. ranking inspiring content higher for users who actively generate content. (4) conducting systematic evaluation of proposed approach in a large short-form video UGC (User-Generated Content) platform.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation Systems for Ad Creation: A View from the Trenches (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manisha Verma, Shaunak Mishra</p>
    <p>Creative design is one of the key components of generating engaging content on the web. E-commerce websites need engaging product descriptions, social networks require user posts to have different types of content such as videos, images and hashtags, and traditional media formats such as blogs require content creators to constantly innovate their writing style, and choice of content they publish to engage with their intended audience. Designing the right content, irrespective of the industry, is a time consuming task, often requires several iterations of content selection and modification. Advertising is one such industry where content is the key to capture user interest and generate revenue. Designing engaging and attention grabbing advertisements requires extensive domain knowledge and market trend awareness. This motivates companies to hire marketing specialists to design specific advertising content, most often tasked to create text, image or video advertisements. This process is tedious and iterative which limits the amount of content that can be produced manually. In this talk, we summarize our work focused on automating ad creative design by leveraging state of the art approaches in text mining, ranking, generation, multimodal (visual-linguistic) representations, multilingual text understanding, and recommendation. We discuss how such approaches can help to reduce the time spent on designing ads, and showcase their impact on real world advertising systems and metrics.</p>

    <h3>Image Discovery and Insertion for Custom Publishing (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerry Liu, Shanchan Wu, Lei Liu</p>
    <p>Images in reading materials make the content come alive. Aside from providing additional information to the text, reading material containing illustration engages our spatial memory, increases memory retention of the material. However, despite the plethora of available multimedia, adding illustrations to text continues to be a difficult task for the amateur content publisher. To address this problem, we present a semantic-aware image discovery and insertion system for custom publishing. Compared to image search engines, our system has the advantage of being able to discern among different topics within a long text passage and recommend the most relevant images for each detected topic with semantic “visual words” based relevance.</p>
