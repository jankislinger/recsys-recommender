    <h3>The Fault in Our Recommendations: On the Perils of Optimizing the Measurable (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshit Kumar, Yash Kanoria, Omar Besbes</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems play a pivotal role on digital platforms by curating content, products and services for users. These systems are widespread, and through customized recommendations, promise to match users with options they will like. To that end,  data on engagement is collected and used, with, e.g., measurements of clicks, but also  purchases or consumption times.   Most recommendation systems are ranking-based, where they rank and recommend items based on their predicted engagement.  However, the engagement signals  are often only a crude proxy for user utility, as data on the latter is rarely collected or available. This paper explores the following critical research question: By optimizing for measurable proxies, are recommendation systems at risk of significantly under-delivering on user utility? If that is indeed the case, how can one improve utility which is seldom measured? To study these questions, we introduce a model of repeated user consumption in which, at each interaction, users select between an outside option and the best option from a recommendation set. Our model accounts for user heterogeneity, with the majority preferring “popular” content, and a minority favoring “niche” content. The system initially lacks knowledge of individual user preferences but can learn these preferences through observations of users’ choices over time. Our theoretical and numerical analysis demonstrate that optimizing for engagement signals can lead to significant utility losses. Instead, we propose a utility-aware policy that initially recommends a mix of popular and niche content. We show that such a policy substantially improves  utility despite not measuring it. In fact, in the limit of a forward-looking platform with discount factor $\delta \to 1$, our utility-aware policy achieves the best of both worlds: near-optimal user utility and near-optimal engagement simultaneously. Our study elucidates  an important feature of recommendation systems; given the ability to suggest multiple items, one can perform significant exploration without incurring significant reductions in short term engagement. By recommending high-risk, high-reward items alongside popular items, systems can enhance discovery of high utility items without significantly affecting engagement.</p>

    <h3>Bridging Viewpoints in News with Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia Hua Jeng</p>
    <p>News Recommender systems (NRSs) aid in decision-making in news media. However, undesired effects can emerge. Among these are selective exposures that may contribute to polarization, potentially reinforcing existing attitudes through belief perseverance—discounting contrary evidence due to their opposing attitudinal strength. This can be unsafe for people, making it difficult to accept information objectively. A crucial issue in news recommender system research is how to mitigate these undesired effects by designing recommender interfaces and machine learning models that enable people to consider to be more open to different perspectives. Alongside accurate models, the user experience is an equally important measure. Indeed, the core statistics are based on users’ behaviors and experiences in this research project. Therefore, this research agenda aims to steer the choices of readers’ based on altering their attitudes. The core methods plan to concentrate on the interface design and ML model building involving manipulations of cues, users’ behaviors prediction, NRSs algorithm and changing the nudges. In sum, the project aims to provide insight in the extent to which news recommender systems can be effective in mitigating polarized opinions.</p>

    <h3>Instructing and Prompting Large Language Models for Explainable Cross-domain Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Petruzzelli, Cataldo Musto, Pasquale Lops, Marco de Gemmis, Ivan Rinaldi, Giovanni Semeraro, Lucrezia Laraspata</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present a strategy to provide users with explainable cross-domain recommendations (CDR) that exploits large language models (LLMs). Generally speaking, cross-domain recommender systems typically suffer of data sparsity issues, since they require a large amount of data labeled in both base and target domains, which are not easy to collect. Accordingly, our approach relies on the intuition that the knowledge that is already encoded in LLMs can be used to bridge the domains and seamlessly provide users with personalized cross-domain suggestions. To this end, we designed a pipeline to: (a) instruct a LLM to handle a CDR task; (b) design a personalized prompt, based on the preferences of the user in a base domain, in both zero-shot and one-shot settings; (c) feed the LLM with the prompt, and process the answer in order to extract the recommendations in a target domain, together with a natural language explanation supporting the suggestion. As shown in the experimental evaluation, our approach beats several established state-of-the-art baselines for CDR in most of the experimental settings, thus showing the effectiveness of LLMs also in this novel and scarcely investigated scenario.</p>

    <h3>Biased User History Synthesis for Personalized Long-Tail Item Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elan Markowitz, Greg Ver Steeg, Abdulla Alshabanah, Keshav Balasubramanian, Murali Annavaram</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems connect users to items and create value chains in the internet economy. Recommendation systems learn from past user-item interaction histories. As such, items that have short interaction histories, either because they are new or not popular, are disproportionately under-recommended. This long-tail item problem can exacerbate model bias, and reinforce poor recommendation of tail items. In this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm, <i>biased user history synthesis</i>, to not only address this problem but also achieve better personalization in recommendation systems. As a result, we concurrently improve tail and head item recommendation performance. Our approach is built on a tail item biased User Interaction History (UIH) sampling strategy and a synthesis model that produces an augmented user representation from the sampled user history. We provide a theoretical justification for our approach using information theory and demonstrate through extensive experimentation, that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on tail, head, and overall recommendation. the source code is available at https://github.com/lkp411/BiasedUserHistorySynthesis.</p>

    <h3>Context-based Entity Recommendation for Knowledge Workers: Establishing a Benchmark on Real-life Data (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahta Bakhshizadeh, Heiko Maus, Andreas Dengel</p>
    <p>In recent decades, recommender systems have undergone significant advancements, particularly in popular domains like movies, music, and product recommendations. Yet, progress has been notably slower in leveraging these systems for personal information management and knowledge assistance. In addition to challenges that complicate the adoption of recommender systems in this domain (such as privacy concerns, heterogeneous recommendation items, and frequent context switching), a significant barrier to progress in this area has been the absence of a standardized benchmark for researchers to evaluate their approaches. In response to this gap, this paper presents a benchmark built upon a publicly available dataset of real-life knowledge work in context (RLKWiC). This benchmark focuses on evaluating context-based entity recommendation, a use case for leveraging recommender systems to support knowledge workers in their daily digital tasks. By providing this benchmark, it is aimed to facilitate and accelerate research efforts in enhancing personal knowledge assistance through recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Reproducibility of LLM-based Recommender Systems: the case study of P5 paradigm (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Polignano, Cataldo Musto, Giovanni Semeraro, Pasquale Lops, Antonio Silletti</p>
    <p>Recommender systems field may greatly benefit of the availability of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs), which can serve as the core mechanism to generate recommendations based on detailed user and item data, such as textual descriptions, user reviews, and metadata.  On one hand this new generation of LLM-based recommender systems paves the way to deal with traditional limitations, such as cold-start and data sparsity, but on the other hand this poses fundamental challenges for their accountability.  Reproducing experiments in the new context of LLM-based recommender systems is very challenging for several reasons. New approaches are published at an unprecedented pace, which makes difficult to have a clear picture of the main protocols and good practices in the experimental evaluation. Moreover, the lack of proper frameworks for LLM-based recommendation development and evaluation makes the process of benchmarking models complex and uncertain. In this work, we discuss the main issues encountered when trying to reproduce P5 (Pretrain, Personalized Prompt, and Prediction Paradigm), one of the first works unifying different recommendation tasks in a shared language modeling and natural language generation framework.  Starting from this study, we have developed OurFramework4LLM (anonymized name), a framework for training and evaluating LLMs, specifically for the recommendation task. It has been used to perform several experiments to assess the impact of different LLMs, personalization and novel set of more informative prompts on the overall performance of recommendations, in a fully reproducible environment.</p>

    <h3>How to Evaluate Serendipity in Recommender Systems: the Need for a Serendiptionnaire (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brett Binst</p>
    <p>Recommender systems can assist in various user tasks and serve diverse values, including exploring the item space. Serendipity has recently received considerable attention, often seen as a way to broaden users’ tastes and counteract filter bubbles. However, the field of research on serendipity is fragmented regarding its evaluation methods, which impedes the progress of knowledge accumulation. This research plan proposes two studies to address these issues. First, a systematic literature review will be conducted to provide insights into how serendipity is currently studied in the field. This review will serve as a reference for novice researchers and help mitigate fragmentation by presenting a thorough overview of the field. This systematic literature review has already revealed a significant gap: the lack of a validated, widely accepted method for evaluating serendipity. Therefore, the second part of this research plan is to develop a validated questionnaire, the serendiptionnaire, to measure serendipity. This tool will provide a ground truth for evaluating serendipity, aiding in answering fundamental questions within the field and validating offline metrics.</p>

    <h3>Explainable and Faithful Educational Recommendations through Causal Language Modelling via Knowledge Graphs (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neda Afreen</p>
    <p>The rapid expansion of digital education has significantly increased the need for recommender systems to help learners navigate the extensive variety of available learning resources. Recent advancements in these systems have notably improved the personalization of course recommendations. However, many existing systems fail to provide clear explanations for their recommendations, making it difficult for learners to understand why a particular suggestion was made. This lack of transparency can negatively impact trust and acceptance of the system. Researchers have emphasized the importance of explanations in various other domains such as ecommerce, media, and entertainment, demonstrating how explanations can enhance system transparency, foster user trust, and improve decision-making processes. Despite these insights, such approaches have been rarely applied to the educational domain, and their effectiveness in practical use remains largely unexamined. My research focuses on developing explainable recommender systems for digital education. First, I aim to design knowledge graphs that can support high-quality recommendations in the context of education. Second, I will create models backed by these knowledge graphs that not only deliver accurate recommendations but also provide faithful explanations for each suggestion, helping learners make informed decisions. Third, I will evaluate the effectiveness of these explainable recommender systems in real-world scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Putting Popularity Bias Mitigation to the Test: A User-Centric Evaluation in Music Recommenders (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Ungruh, Karlijn Dinnissen, Maria Soledad Pera, Hanna Hauptmann, Anja Volk</p>
    <p>Popularity bias is a prominent phenomenon in recommender systems (RS), especially in the music domain. Although popularity bias mitigation techniques are known to enhance the fairness of RS while maintaining their high performance, there is a lack of understanding regarding users’ actual perception of the suggested music. To address this gap, we conducted a user study (n=40) exploring user satisfaction and perception of personalized music recommendations generated by algorithms that explicitly mitigate popularity bias. Specifically, we investigate item-centered and user-centered bias mitigation techniques, aiming to ensure fairness for artists or users, respectively. Results show that neither mitigation technique harms the users’ satisfaction with the recommendation lists despite promoting underrepresented items. However, the item-centered mitigation technique impacts user perception; by promoting less popular items, it reduces users’ familiarity with the items. Lower familiarity evokes discovery—the feeling that the recommendations enrich the user’s taste. We demonstrate that this  can ultimately lead to higher satisfaction, highlighting the potential of less-popular recommendations to improve the user experience.</p>

    <p>This is a dissertation plan built around human-centered empirical experiments evaluating recommender systems (RecSys). We see this as an important research theme since many AI-based RecSys algorithmic studies lack real human assessment. Therefore, we do not know how they work in the wild that only human experiments can tell us. We split this extended abstract into two parts — 1) A series of individual studies focusing on open questions about different human values or recommendation algorithms. Our completed works include user control over content diversity, user appreciation on DL-RecSys algorithms, and human-LLMRec interaction study. We also propose three future works to understand news recommendation depolarization, personalized news podcast, and interactive user representation; 2) An experimentation infrastructure named POPROX. As a personalized news recommendation platform, it aims to support the longitudinal study needs from the general AI and RecSys research community.</p>

    <h3>Democratizing Urban Mobility Through an Open-Source, Multi-Criteria Route Recommendation System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Eggerth, Javier Argota Sánchez-Vaquerizo, Sachit Mahajan, Dirk Helbing</p>
    <p>Urban navigation systems traditionally optimize for efficiency, thereby overlooking environmental factors and personal preferences. This paper introduces Routify, a novel multi-criteria recommender system for personalized urban route selection. Routify advances the state-of-the-art in route recommendation through: (1) integration of diverse environmental data (air quality, noise levels, green spaces) with real-time IoT inputs; (2) a dynamic weighting algorithm allowing fine-grained user control over routing parameters; (3) transparent decision-making via an interactive interface displaying edge-level information; and (4) a community-driven feedback mechanism that continuously refines recommendations. We have implemented Routify as an open-source platform, facilitating further research and development. Experimental results from 1000 origin-destination pairs demonstrate significant improvements in user-defined environmental metrics (up to 32.98% increase in green index for walking and 16.91% reduction in noise levels for cycling) compared to traditional routing systems. These improvements come with slight trade-offs in distance, especially in walking mode. Our research contributes a comprehensive framework for multi-criteria route recommendation, balancing individual preferences, environmental factors, and community insights in urban navigation.</p>

    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Kaufman, Franklin Horn, Aurelia Alston, Won You</p>
    <p>News publishers, who are seeking to grow their digital audience, face a challenge in providing relevant content recommendations for unregistered users arriving directly to article pages. In these cold start scenarios, classic techniques, like asking a user to register and select topics of interest, fall short. We present a contextual targeting approach that leverages the user’s current article choice itself as an implicit signal of user interests. We designed and developed an interface with recommendations to help users discover more articles. Our online A/B testing demonstrated that our models increased click-through rates by 39.4% over a popularity baseline. One of them, a large language model (LLM), generates relevant recommendations that balance immersion and novelty. We discuss the implications of using LLMs for responsibly enhancing user experiences while upholding editorial standards. We identify key opportunities in detecting nuanced user preferences and identifying and interrupting filter bubbles on news publisher sites.</p>

    <h3>Towards Sustainable Recommendations in Urban Tourism (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel Merinov</p>
    <p>In the context of urban tourism promotion, I am exploring how recommender systems (RSs) can personalise information in order to shift tourists behaviour from typically popularity-biased towards more niche and urban-friendly. This problem has a great importance in sustainability online promotion campaigns. Urban destination managers strive to prevent overcrowding at popular points of interest (POIs), by attracting visitors to less popular POIs, while still providing personalised access to information. It is assumed, that this approach will maintain a healthy distribution of tourists in a city; both reducing tourist congestion, and, considering each POI as a local business, maintaining the long-term economic viability in a city. This problem has already received some attention in the literature, targeting major European touristic cities. However, many complex issues still need to be resolved for a comprehensive solution. In this extended abstract, I highlight open research problems, and identify key research questions (RQs) that are crucial for advancing sustainable tourism development leveraging RSs. Although the proposed methods are focused on urban tourism, their application extends to different areas of recommendations because the RQs and the proposed methods and techniques are general.</p>

    <h3>FedLoCA: Low-Rank Coordinated Adaptation with Knowledge Decoupling for Federated Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yong Liao, Boyu Fan, Pengyuan Zhou, Siqing Zhang, Yuchen Ding, Wei Sun</p>
    <p>Privacy protection in recommendation systems is gaining increasing attention, for which federated learning has emerged as a promising solution. Current federated recommendation systems grapple with high communication overhead due to sharing dense global embeddings, and also poorly reflect user preferences due to data heterogeneity. To overcome these challenges, we propose a two-stage Federated Low-rank Coordinated Adaptation (FedLoCA) framework to decouple global and client-specific knowledge into low-rank embeddings, which significantly reduces communication overhead while enhancing the system’s ability to capture individual user preferences amidst data heterogeneity. Further, to tackle gradient estimation inaccuracies stemming from data sparsity in federated recommendation systems, we introduce an adversarial gradient projected descent approach in low-rank spaces, which significantly boosts model performance while maintaining robustness. Remarkably, FedLoCA also alleviates performance loss even under the stringent constraints of differential privacy. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that FedLoCA significantly outperforms existing methods in both recommendation accuracy and communication efficiency.</p>
