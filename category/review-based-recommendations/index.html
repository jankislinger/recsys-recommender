    <h3>Neural Gaussian Mixture Model for Review-based Rating Prediction (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haofei Zhou, Jian Yu, Dong Deng, Liping Jing, Sun Shaolong</p>
    <p>Reviews has been proven to be an important information in recommendation. Different from the overall user-item rating matrix, it can provide textual information that exhibits why a user likes an item or not. Recently, more and more researchers have paid attention on review-based rating prediction. There are two challenging issues: how to extract representative features to characterize users / items from reviews and how to leverage them for recommendation system. In this paper, we propose a Neural Gaussian Mixture Model for review-based rating prediction task (NGMM). Among it, the textual review information is used to construct two parallel neural networks for users and items respectively, so that the users’ preferences and items’ properties can be sufficiently extracted and written as two latent vectors. A shared layer is introduced on the top to couple these two networks together and model user-item rating based on the features learned from reviews. Specifically, each rating is modeled via a Gaussian mixture model, where each Gaussian component has zero variance, the mean described by the corresponding component in user’s latent vector and the weight indicated by the corresponding component in item’s latent vector. Extensive experiments are conducted on five real-world Amazon review datasets. The experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed NGMM model achieves the state-of-the-art performance in review-based rating prediction task.</p>

    <h3>Ratings Meet Reviews, a Combined Approach to Recommend (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guang Ling, Irwin King, Michael Lyu</p>
    <p>Most existing recommender systems focus on modeling the ratings while ignoring the abundant information embedded in the review text. In this paper, we propose a unified model that combines content-based filtering with collaborative filtering, harnessing the information of both ratings and reviews. We apply topic modeling techniques on the review text and align the topics with rating dimensions to improve prediction accuracy. With the information embedded in the review text, we can alleviate the cold-start problem. Furthermore, our model is able to learn latent topics that are interpretable. With these interpretable topics, we can explore the prior knowledge on items or users and recommend completely “cold” items. Empirical study on 27 classes of real-life datasets show that our proposed model lead to significant improvement compared with strong baseline methods, especially for datasets which are extremely sparse where rating-only methods cannot make accurate predictions.</p>
