    <h3>Private Matrix Factorization with Public Item Features (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Walid Krichene, Mihaela Curmei, Li Zhang</p>
    <p>We consider the problem of training private recommendation models with access to public item features. Training with Differential Privacy (DP) offers strong privacy guarantees, at the expense of loss in recommendation quality. We show that incorporating public item features during training can help mitigate this loss in quality. We propose a general approach based on collective matrix factorization, that works by simultaneously factorizing two matrices: the user feedback matrix (representing sensitive data) and an item feature matrix that encodes publicly available (non-sensitive) item information. The method is conceptually simple, easy to tune, and highly scalable. It can be applied to different types of public data, including: (1) categorical item features; (2) item-item similarities learned from public sources; and (3) publicly available user feedback. Evaluating our method on a standard DP recommendation benchmark, we find that using public item features significantly narrows the quality gap between the private models and their non-private counterpart. As privacy constraints become more stringent, the increased reliance on public side features leads to recommendations becoming more depersonalized, resulting in a smooth transition from collaborative filtering to item-based contextual recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Closed-Form Models for Collaborative Filtering with Side-Information (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Van Balen, Bart Goethals, Olivier Jeunen</p>
    <p>Recent work has shown that, despite their simplicity, item-based models optimised through ridge regression can attain highly competitive results on collaborative filtering tasks. As these models are analytically computable and thus forgo the need for often expensive iterative optimisation procedures, they are an attractive choice for practitioners. We study the applicability of such closed-form models to implicit-feedback collaborative filtering when additional side-information or metadata about items is available. Two complementary extensions to the easer paradigm are proposed, based on collective and additive models. Through an extensive empirical analysis on several large-scale datasets, we show that our methods can effectively exploit side-information whilst retaining a closed-form solution, and improve upon the state-of-the-art without increasing the computational complexity of the original easer approach. Additionally, empirical results demonstrate that the use of side-information leads to more “long tail” items being recommended, benefiting the recommendations’ coverage of the item catalogue.</p>

    <h3>Unifying Nearest Neighbors Collaborative Filtering (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koen Verstrepen, Bart Goethals</p>
    <p>We study collaborative filtering for applications in which there exists for every user a set of items about which the user has given binary, positive-only feedback (one-class collaborative filtering). Take for example an on-line store that knows all past purchases of every customer. An important class of algorithms for one-class collaborative filtering are the nearest neighbors algorithms, typically divided into user-based and item-based algorithms. We introduce a reformulation that unifies user- and item-based nearest neighbors algorithms and use this reformulation to propose a novel algorithm that incorporates the best of both worlds and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, we propose a method for naturally explaining the recommendations made by our algorithm and show that this method is also applicable to existing user-based nearest neighbors methods.</p>
