    <h3>Not All Videos Become Outdated: Short-Video Recommendation by Learning to Deconfound Release Interval Bias (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aixin Sun, Guoxiu He, Lulu Dong</p>
    <p>Short-video recommender systems often exhibit a biased preference to recently released videos. However, not all videos become outdated; certain classic videos can still attract user’s attention. Such bias along temporal dimension can be further aggravated by the matching model between users and videos, because the model learns from preexisting interactions. From real data, we observe that different videos have varying sensitivities to recency in attracting users’ attention. Our analysis, based on a causal graph modeling short-video recommendation, suggests that the release interval serves as a confounder, establishing a backdoor path between users and videos. To address this confounding effect, we propose a model-agnostic causal architecture called Learning to Deconfound the Release Interval Bias (LDRI). LDRI enables jointly learning of the matching model and the video recency sensitivity perceptron. In the inference stage, we apply a backdoor adjustment, effectively blocking the backdoor path by intervening on each video. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that LDRI consistently outperforms backbone models and exhibits superior performance against state-of-the-art models. Additional comprehensive analyses confirm the deconfounding capability of LDRI. Our code is available online: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LDRI/.</p>

    <h3>Sequential Recommendation Models: A Graph-based Perspective (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Peintner</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RecSys) traditionally leverage the users’ rich interaction data with the system, but ignore the sequential dependency of items. Sequential recommender systems aim to predict the next item the user will interact with (e.g., click on, purchase, or listen to) based on the preceding interactions of the user. Current state-of-the-art approaches focus on transformer-based architectures and graph neural networks. Specifically, the modeling of sequences as graphs has shown to be a promising approach to introduce a structured bias into the recommendation learning framework. In this work, we will outline our research of exploring different applications of graphs in sequential recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Trending Now: Modeling Trend Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anoop Deoras, Venkataramana Kini, Hao Wang, Yupeng Gu, Fei Wang, Youngsuk Park, Ravi Divvela, Yifei Ma, Branislav Kveton, Hao Ding</p>
    <p>Modern recommender systems usually include separate recommendation carousels such as ‘trending now’ to list trending items and further boost their popularity, thereby attracting active users. Though widely useful, such ‘trending now‘ carousels typically generate item lists based on simple heuristics, e.g., the number of interactions within a time interval, and therefore still leave much room for improvement. This paper aims to systematically study this under-explored but important problem from the new perspective of time series forecasting. We first provide a set of rigorous definitions related to item trendiness with associated evaluation protocols, and then propose a deep latent variable model, dubbed Trend Recommender (TrendRec), to forecast items’ future trend and generate trending item lists. Experiments on real-world datasets from various domains show that our TrendRec significantly outperforms the baselines, verifying our model’s effectiveness.</p>

    <h3>Progressive Horizon Learning: Adaptive Long Term Optimization for Personalized Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Ni, Shreya Chakrabarti, Congrui Yi, David Zumwalt</p>
    <p>As B2C companies such as Amazon, Netflix, Spotify scale, personalized recommender systems are often needed to further drive long term business growth in acquisition, engagement, and retention of customers. However, long-term metrics associated with these goals can require several months to mature. Additionally, deep personalization also demands a large volume of training data that take a long time to collect. These factors incur substantial lead time for training a model to optimize a long-term metric. Before such model is deployed, a recommender system has to rely on a simple policy (e.g. random) to collect customer feedback data for training, inflicting high opportunity cost and delaying optimization of the target metric. Besides, as customer preferences can shift over time, a large temporal gap between inputs and outcome poses a high risk of data staleness and suboptimal learning. Existing approaches involve various compromises. For instance, contextual bandits often optimize short-term surrogate metrics with simple model structure, which can be suboptimal in the long run, while Reinforcement Learning approaches rely on an abundance of historical data for offline training, which essentially means long lead time before deployment. To address these problems, we propose Progressive Horizon Learning Recommender (PHLRec), a personalized model that can progressively learn metric patterns and adaptively evolve from short- to long-term optimization over time. Through simulations and real data experiments, we demonstrated that PHLRec outperforms competing methods, achieving optimality in both deployment speed and long-term metric performances.</p>

    <h3>Incorporating Time in Sequential Recommendation Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Caverlee, Mostafa Rahmani, Fei Wang</p>
    <p>Sequential models are designed to learn sequential patterns in data based on the chronological order of user interactions. However, they often ignore the timestamps of these interactions. Incorporating time is crucial because many sequential patterns are time-dependent, and the model cannot make time-aware recommendations without considering time. This article demonstrates that providing a rich representation of time can significantly improve the performance of sequential models. The existing literature treats time as a one-dimensional time-series obtained by quantizing time. In this study, we propose treating time as a multi-dimensional time-series and explore representation learning methods, including  a kernel based method and an embedding-based algorithm. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the inclusion of time significantly enhances the model’s performance, and multi-dimensional methods outperform the one-dimensional method by a substantial margin.</p>

    <h3>Towards Self-Explaining Sequence-Aware Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Boratto, Alejandro Ariza-Casabona, Maria Salamo, Gianni Fenu</p>
    <p>Self-explaining models are becoming an important perk of recommender systems, as they help users understand the reason behind certain recommendations, which encourages them to interact more often with the platform. In order to personalize recommendations, modern recommender approaches make the model aware of the user behavior history for interest evolution representation. However, existing explainable recommender systems do not consider the past user history to further personalize the explanation based on the user interest fluctuation. In this work, we propose a SEQuence-Aware Explainable Recommendation model (SEQUER) that is able to leverage the sequence of user-item review interactions to generate better explanations while maintaining recommendation performance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposal on multiple recommendation scenarios. Our source code and preprocessed datasets are available at https://tinyurl.com/SEQUER-RECSYS23.</p>

    <h3>Ti-DC-GNN: Incorporating Time-Interval Dual Graphs for Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Ivanova, Nikita Severin, Ivan Kireev, Ilya Makarov, Andrey Savchenko, Dmitrii Kiselev</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are essential for personalized content delivery and have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, traditional recommender systems are limited in their ability to capture complex relationships between users and items. Recently, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a promising solution for improving recommender systems by incorporating temporal and sequential information in dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel method, “Ti-DC-GNN” (Time-Interval Dual Causal Graph Neural Networks), based on an intermediate representation of graph evolution as a sequence of time-interval graphs. The main parts of the method are the novel forms of interval graphs: graph of causality and graph of consequence that explicitly preserve inter-relationships between edges (user-items interactions). The local and global message passing are developed based on edge memory to identify both short-term and long-term dependencies. Experiments on several well-known datasets show that our method consistently outperforms modern temporal GNNs with node memory alone in dynamic edge prediction tasks.</p>

    <h3>Multi-Relational Contrastive Learning for Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lianghao Xia, Chao Huang, Wei Wei</p>
    <p>Dynamic behavior modeling has become a crucial task for personalized recommender systems that aim to learn users’ time-evolving preferences on online platforms. However, many recommendation models rely on a single type of behavior learning, which significantly limits their ability to represent user-item relationships in real-life applications where interactions between users and items often come in multiple types (e.g., click, tag-as-favorite, review, and purchase). To offer better recommendations, this paper proposes the Evolving Graph Contrastive Memory Network (EGCM) to model dynamic interaction heterogeneity. Firstly, we develop a multi-relational graph encoder to capture short-term preference heterogeneity and preserve the dedicated relation semantics for different types of user-item interactions. Additionally, we design a dynamic cross-relational memory network that enables EGCM to capture users’ long-term multi-behavior preferences and the underlying evolving cross-type behavior dependencies over time. To obtain robust and informative user representations with both commonality and diversity across multi-behavior interactions, we design a multi-relational contrastive learning paradigm with heterogeneous short- and long-term interest modeling. We further provide theoretical analyses to support the modeling of commonality and diversity from the perspective of enhancing model optimization. Experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our recommender system over various state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

    <h3>Ex2Vec: Characterizing Users and Items from the Mere Exposure Effect (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Sguerra, Romain Hennequin</p>
    <p>The traditional recommendation framework seeks to connect user and content, by finding the best match possible based on users past interaction. However, a good content recommendation is not necessarily similar to what the user has chosen in the past. One limitation of basing future interaction on what happened in the past is that it ignores the fact that both sides of the problems are dynamic. As human, users naturally evolve, learn, forget, get bored, they change their perspective of the world and in consequence, of the recommendable content. In this work we present Ex2Vec our framework for accounting to the dynamic of the human side of the recommendation problem. We introduce the Mere Exposure Effect as a common phenomenon in music streaming platforms. We then present our model that leverage the effect for jointly characterizing users and music. We validate our model through predicting future music consumption based on repetition and discuss its implications.</p>

    <h3>Exploring the Impact of Temporal Bias in Point-of-Interest Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Tourani, Hossein A. Rahmani, Yashar Deldjoo, Mohammadmehdi Naghiaei</p>
    <p>Recommending appropriate travel destinations to consumers based on contextual information such as their check-in time and location is a primary objective of Point-of-Interest (POI) recommender systems. However, the issue of contextual bias (i.e., how much consumers prefer one situation over another) has received little attention from the research community. This paper examines the effect of temporal bias, defined as the difference between users’ check-in hours, leisure vs. work hours, on the consumer-side fairness of context-aware recommendation algorithms. We believe that eliminating this type of temporal (and geographical) bias might contribute to a drop in traffic-related air pollution, noting that rush-hour traffic may be more congested. To surface effective POI recommendation, we evaluated the sensitivity of state-of-the-art context-aware models to the temporal bias contained in users’ check-in activities on two POI datasets, namely Gowalla and Yelp. The findings show that the examined context-aware recommendation models prefer one group of users over another based on the time of check-in and that this preference persists even when users have the same amount of interactions.</p>

    <h3>Burst-induced Multi-Armed Bandit for Learning Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrigo Alves, Antoine Ledent, Marius Kloft</p>
    <p>In this paper, we introduce a non-stationary and context-free Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem and a novel algorithm (which we refer to as BMAB) to solve it. The problem is context-free in the sense that no side information about users or items is needed. We work in a continuous-time setting where each timestamp corresponds to a visit by a user and a corresponding decision regarding recommendation. The main novelty is that we model the reward distribution as a consequence of variations in the intensity of the activity, and thereby we assist the exploration/exploitation dilemma by exploring the temporal dynamics of the audience. To achieve this, we assume that the recommendation procedure can be split into two different states: the loyal and the curious state. We identify the current state by modelling the events as a mixture of two Poisson processes, one for each of the possible states. We further assume that the loyal audience is associated with a single stationary reward distribution, but each bursty period comes with its own reward distribution. We test our algorithm and compare it to several baselines in two strands of experiments: synthetic data simulations and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that BMAB achieves competitive results when compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>Learning An Adaptive Meta Model-Generator for Incrementally Updating Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Zhang, Sinno Jialin Pan, Danni Peng, Anxiang Zeng</p>
    <p>Recommender Systems (RSs) in real-world applications often deal with billions of user interactions daily. To capture the most recent trends effectively, it is common to update the model incrementally using only the newly arrived data. However, this may impede the model’s ability to retain long-term information due to the potential overfitting and forgetting issues. To address this problem, we propose a novel Adaptive Sequential Model Generation (ASMG) framework, which generates a better serving model from a sequence of historical models via a meta generator. For the design of the meta generator, we propose to employ Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to leverage its ability to capture the long-term dependencies. We further introduce some novel strategies to apply together with the GRU meta generator, which not only improve its computational efficiency but also enable more accurate sequential modeling. By instantiating the model-agnostic framework on a general deep learning-based RS model, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets and one industrial dataset.</p>

    <h3>Sequential User-based Recurrent Neural Network Recommendations (2017)</h3>

    <p>Recurrent Neural Networks are powerful tools for modeling sequences. They are flexibly extensible and can incorporate various kinds of information including temporal order. These properties make them well suited for generating sequential recommendations. In this paper, we extend Recurrent Neural Networks by considering unique characteristics of the Recommender Systems domain. One of these characteristics is the explicit notion of the user recommendations are specifically generated for. We show how individual users can be represented in addition to sequences of consumed items in a new type of Gated Recurrent Unit to effectively produce personalized next item recommendations. Offline experiments on two real-world datasets indicate that our extensions clearly improve objective performance when compared to state-of-the-art recommender algorithms and to a conventional Recurrent Neural Network.</p>

    <p>Repeat Purchases have become increasingly important in measuring customer’s satisfaction and loyalty to e-commerce websites in regard to online shopping. In this paper, we first propose a model for estimating repeat purchase frequency in a given time period from a given product category using Poisson/Gamma model. Second, we estimate the purchase probabilities of different product types in a product category for each customer using Dirichlet model. Experimental results on data collected by a real-world e-commerce website show that it can predict a user’s average repeat purchase frequency along with their product types with decent accuracy. We also argue that the output of our models can be used as prior information to enhance the performance of time-sensitive recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Temporal Influence in Online Recommendation (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Palovics, Tamas Kiss, Andras Benczur, Erzsebet Frigo, Levente Kocsis</p>
    <p>In this paper we give methods for time aware music recommendation in a social media service with the potential of exploiting immediate temporal influences between users. We consider events when a user listens to an artist the first time and this event follows some friend listening to the same artist short time before. We train a blend of matrix factorization methods that model the relation of the influencer, the influenced and the artist, both the individual factor decompositions and their weight learned by variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Special care is taken since events of influence form a subset of the positive implicit feedback data and hence we have to cope with two different definitions of the positive and negative implicit training data. In addition, in the time aware setting we have to use online learning and evaluation methods. While SGD can easily be trained online, evaluation is cumbersome by traditional measures since we will have potentially different top recommendations at different times. Our experiments are carried over the two-year scrobble history of 70,000 Last.fm users and show a 4% increase in recommendation quality by predicting temporal influences.</p>
