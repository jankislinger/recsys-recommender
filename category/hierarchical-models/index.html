    <h3>Personalized Category Frequency prediction for Buy It Again recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kunal Ghosh, Rankyung Park, Amit Pande</p>
    <p>Buy It Again (BIA) recommendations are crucial to retailers to help improve user experience and site engagement by suggest- ing items that customers are likely to buy again based on their own repeat purchasing patterns. Most existing BIA studies analyze guests’ personalized behaviour at item granularity. This finer level of granularity might be appropriate for small businesses or small datasets for search purposes. However, this approach can be infea- sible for big retailers like Amazon, Walmart, or Target which have hundreds of millions of guests and tens of millions of items. For such data sets, it is more practical to have a coarse-grained model that captures customer behaviour at the item category level. In addition, customers commonly explore variants of items within the same categories, e.g., trying different brands or flavors of yogurt. A category-based model may be more appropriate in such scenarios. We propose a recommendation system called a hierarchical PCIC model that consists of a personalized category model (PC model) and a personalized item model within categories (IC model). PC model generates a personalized list of categories that customers are likely to purchase again. IC model ranks items within categories that guests are likely to reconsume within a category. The hierarchical PCIC model captures the general consumption rate of products using survival models. Trends in consumption are captured using time series models. Features derived from these models are used in training a category-grained neural network. We compare PCIC to twelve existing baselines on four standard open datasets. PCIC improves NDCG up to 16% while improving recall by around 2%. We were able to scale and train (over 8 hours) PCIC on a large dataset of 100M guests and 3M items where repeat categories of a guest outnumber repeat items. PCIC was deployed and A/B tested on the site of a major retailer, leading to significant gains in guest engagement.</p>

    <h3>Hierarchical Latent Relation Modeling for Collaborative Metric Learning (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillaume Salha-Galvan, Romain Hennequin, Viet-Anh Tran, Manuel Moussallam</p>
    <p>Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for recommendation based on implicit feedback collaborative filtering. However, standard CML methods learn fixed user and item representations, which fails to capture the complex interests of users. Existing extensions of CML also either ignore the heterogeneity of user-item relations, i.e. that a user can simultaneously like very different items, or the latent item-item relations, i.e. that a user’s preference for an item depends, not only on its intrinsic characteristics, but also on items they previously interacted with. In this paper, we present a hierarchical CML model that jointly captures latent user-item and item-item relations from implicit data. Our approach is inspired by translation mechanisms from knowledge graph embedding and leverages memory-based attention networks. We empirically show the relevance of this joint relational modeling, by outperforming existing CML models on recommendation tasks on several real-world datasets. Our experiments also emphasize the limits of current CML relational models on very sparse datasets.</p>

    <h3>A Hierarchical Bayesian Model for Size Recommendation in Fashion (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuen King Ho, Abdul-Saboor Sheikh, Evgenyi Koryagin, Reza Shirvany, Urs Bergmann, Romain Guigourès</p>
    <p>We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian approach to tackle the challenging problem of size recommendation in e-commerce fashion. Our approach jointly models a size purchased by a customer, and its possible return event: 1. no return, 2. returned too small 3. returned too big. Those events are drawn following a multinomial distribution parameterized on the joint probability of each event, built following a hierarchy combining priors. Such a model allows us to incorporate extended domain expertise and article characteristics as prior knowledge, which in turn makes it possible for the underlying parameters to emerge thanks to sufficient data. Experiments are presented on real (anonymized) data from millions of customers along with a detailed discussion on the efficiency of such an approach within a large scale production system.</p>

    <h3>Content Driven User Profiling for Comment-Worthy Recommendations of News and Blog Articles (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mrinal Das, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Trapit Bansal</p>
    <p>We consider the problem of recommending articles such as news and blog-posts. An article is defined to be comment-worthy for a particular user if that user is interested to leave a comment on it. We note that recommending comment-worthy articles calls for elicitation of of the user from the of both the articles and the past comments made by users. We thus propose to develop user profiles to elicit these latent interests of users in commenting and use them to recommend articles for future commenting. The difficulty of modeling comment content and the varied nature of users’ commenting interests make the problem technically challenging. The problem of recommending comment-worthy articles is resolved by leveraging article and comment content through topic modeling and the co-commenting pattern of users through collaborative filtering, combined within a novel hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach. Our solution, Collaborative Correspondence Topic Models (CCTM), generates user profiles which are leveraged to provide a personalized ranking of articles for each user. Through these -driven user profiles, CCTM effectively handle the ubiquitous problem of without relying on additional meta-data. The inference problem for the model is intractable with no off-the-shelf solution and we develop an efficient Monte Carlo EM algorithm. CCTM is evaluated on three real world data-sets, crawled from two , ArsTechnica (AT) Gadgets (102,087 comments) and AT-Science (71,640 comments), and a site, DailyMail (33,500 comments). We show average improvement of 14% (warm-start) and 18% (cold-start) in AUC, and 80% (warm-start) and 250% (cold-start) in Hit-Rank@5, over state of the art.</p>
