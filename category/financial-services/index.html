    <h3>A Tool for Explainable Pension Fund Recommendations using Large Language Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edleno Silva de Moura, Eduardo Alves da Silva, Leandro Balby Marinho, Altigran Soares da Silva</p>
    <p>In this demo, we present a prototype tool designed to help financial advisors recommend private pension funds to investors based on their preferences, offering personalized investment suggestions. The tool leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), which enhance explainability by providing clear and understandable rationales for recommendations and effectively handles both sequential and cold-start scenarios. We outline the design, implementation, and results of a user-based evaluation using real-world data. The evaluation shows a high recommendation acceptance rate among financial advisors, highlighting the tool’s potential to improve decision-making in financial advisory services.</p>

    <h3>Task Aware Feature Extraction Framework for Sequential Dependence Multi-Task Learning (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Cheng, Wenfang Lin, Xuewen Tao, Mingming Ha, Qiongxu Ma, Xiaobo Guo</p>
    <p>In online recommendation, financial service, etc., the most common application of multi-task learning (MTL) is the multi-step conversion estimations. A core property of the multi-step conversion is the sequential dependence among tasks. Most existing works focus far more on the specific post-view click-through rate (CTR) and post-click conversion rate (CVR) estimations, which neglect the generalization of sequential dependence multi-task learning (SDMTL). Besides, the performance of the SDMTL framework is also deteriorated by the interference derived from implicitly conflict information passing between adjacent tasks. In this paper, a systematic learning paradigm of the SDMTL problem is established for the first time, which can transform the SDMTL problem into a general MTL problem and be applicable to more general multi-step conversion scenarios with longer conversion path or stronger task dependence. Also, the distribution dependence between adjacent task spaces is illustrated from a theoretical point of view. On the other hand, an SDMTL architecture, named Task Aware Feature Extraction (TAFE), is developed to enable dynamic task representation learning from a sample-wise view. TAFE selectively reconstructs the implicit shared information corresponding to each sample case and performs explicit task-specific extraction under dependence constraints. Extensive experiments on offline public and real-world industrial datasets, and online A/B implementations demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of proposed theoretical and implementation frameworks.</p>

    <h3>A Multi-Stakeholder Recommender System for Rewards Recommendations (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Leontjeva, Thireindar Min, Luiz Pizzato, Naime Ranjbar Kermany, Callum Scott</p>
    <p>Australia’s largest bank, Commonwealth Bank (CBA) has a large data and analytics function that focuses on building a brighter future for all using data and decision science. In this work, we focus on creating better services for CBA customers by developing a next generation recommender system that brings the most relevant merchant reward offers that can help customers save money. Our recommender provides CBA cardholders with cashback offers from merchants, who have different objectives when they create offers. This work describes a multi-stakeholder, multi-objective problem in the context of CommBank Rewards (CBR) and describes how we developed a system that balances the objectives of the bank, its customers, and the many objectives from merchants into a single recommender system.</p>

    <h3>Recommender Systems for Banking and Financial Services (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Danele Regoli, Andrea Gigli, Fabrizio Lillo</p>
    <p>In this work we demonstrate the usefulness of the application of Recommender Systems in the financial domain. Specifically we investigate a dataset, made available by a major European bank, containing the purchases of a large set of investment assets by 200k investors. We also present some preliminary results of the application of network analysis via statistical validation to identify clusters of investment assets.</p>
