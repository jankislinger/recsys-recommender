    <h3>Traversing Semantically Annotated Queries for Task-oriented Query Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Câmara, Rodrygo L. T. Santos</p>
    <p>As search systems gradually turn into intelligent personal assistants, users increasingly resort to a search engine to accomplish a complex task, such as planning a trip, renting an apartment, or investing in stocks. A key challenge for the search engine is to understand the user’s underlying task given a sample query like ‘tickets to panama’, ‘studios in los angeles’, or ‘spotify stocks’, and to suggest other queries to help the user complete the task. In this paper, we investigate several strategies for query recommendation by traversing a semantically annotated query log using a mixture of explicit and latent representations of entire queries and of query segments. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in terms of utility and diversity, as well as their complementarity, with significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art query recommendation baselines adapted for this task. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Guided Walk: A Scalable Recommendation Algorithm for Complex Heterogeneous Social Networks (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uzi Cohen, Roy Levin, Hassan Abassi</p>
    <p>Online social networks have become predominant in recent years and have grown to encompass massive scales of data. In addition to data scale, these networks can be heterogeneous and contain complex structures between different users, between social entities and various interactions between users and social entities. This is especially true in enterprise social networks where hierarchies explicitly exist between employees as well. In such networks, producing the best recommendations for each user is a very challenging problem for two main reasons. First, the complex structures in the social network need to be properly mined and exploited by the algorithm. Second, these networks contain millions or even billions of edges making the problem very difficult computationally. In this paper we present Guided Walk, a supervised graph based algorithm that learns the significance of different network links for each user and then produces entity recommendations based on this learning phase. We compare the algorithm with a set of baseline algorithms using offline evaluation techniques as well as a user survey. The offline results show that the algorithm outperforms the next best algorithm by a factor of 3.6. The user survey further confirms that the recommendation are not only relevant but also rank high in terms of personal relevance for each user. To deal with large scale social networks, the Guided Walk algorithm is formulated as a Pregel program which allows us to utilize the power of distributed parallel computing. This would allow horizontally scaling the algorithm for larger social networks by simply adding more compute nodes to the cluster.</p>

    <h3>RecExp: A Semantic Recommender System with Explanation Based on Heterogeneous Information Network (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip Yu, Jiawei Hu, Jian Liu, Chuan Shi, Zhiqiang Zhang, Bai Wang</p>
    <p>In recent years, there is a surge of research on recommender system to alleviate the information overload. Many recommendation techniques have been proposed and they have achieved great successes in many applications. However, the explanation of recommendation results is an important but seldom addressed problem. In this paper, we organize the objects and relations in a recommender system with a heterogeneous information network, which integrates more informations and contains rich semantics. Then we employ a semantic meta path based personalized recommendation model and design a recommender system with explanation, called RecExp. The RecExp system has two unique features. (1) Semantic recommendation. RecExp provides different recommendation models to comply with users’ requirements through setting of meta paths. (2) Interpretive recommendation. Under a hybrid recommendation model, RecExp provides the explanations for the recommendation results.</p>
