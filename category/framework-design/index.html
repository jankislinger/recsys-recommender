    <h3>Optimizing for Participation in Recommender System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourabh Bansod, Yaping Zhang, Bibang Liu, Mingyan Gao, Yuan Shao, Arnab Bhadury</p>
    <p>The traditional recommender system has been designed to mostly optimize for viewer consumption, and with the rise of short form videos, the boundaries between consumption and participation have blurred. This shift presents an opportunity to optimize recommender systems not only for passive consumption, but also for active participation in content creation. In this paper, we document the development of a recommender system that provides inspiration to existing content uploaders and new future content uploaders to encourage participation. Our contributions are two-fold: 1) Inspiration Framework: We present a novel framework for building a recommender system that goes beyond traditional consumption-focused metrics, specifically addressing the need for creative inspiration to lower barriers for participation. This framework is adaptable in the design of large-scale recommender systems in other domains. 2) Empirical Evaluation: We conduct systematic evaluation via live experiments to prove the values of the proposed system in increasing daily participation and participants.</p>

    <h3>Together is Better: Hybrid Recommendations Combining Graph Embeddings and Contextualized Word Representations (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco de Gemmis, Cataldo Musto, Marco Polignano, Pasquale Lops, Giovanni Semeraro</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present a hybrid recommendation framework based on the combination of graph embeddings and contextual word representations. Our approach is based on the intuition that each of the above mentioned representation models heterogeneous (and equally important) information, that is worth to be taken into account to generate a recommendation. Accordingly, we propose a strategy to combine both the features, which is based on the following steps: first, we separately generate graph embeddings and contextual word representations by exploiting state-of-the-art techniques. Next, these embeddings are used to feed a deep architecture that learns a hybrid representation based on the combination of the single groups of features. Finally, we exploit the resulting embedding to identify suitable recommendations. In the experimental session, we evaluate the effectiveness of our strategy on two datasets and results show that the use of a hybrid representation leads to an improvement of the predictive accuracy. Moreover, our approach overcomes several competitive baselines, thus confirming the validity of this work.</p>

    <h3>A Common Approach for Consumer and Provider Fairness in Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyriakos Mouratidis, Dimitris Sacharidis, Dimitrios Kleftogiannis</p>
    <p>We present a common approach for handling consumer and provider fairness in recommendations. Our solution requires defining two key components, a classification of items and a target distribution, which together define the case of perfect fairness. This formulation allows distinct fairness concepts to be specified in a common framework. We further propose a novel reranking algorithm that optimizes for a desired trade-off between utility and fairness of a recommendation list.</p>

    <h3>IRF: Interactive Recommendation through Dialogue (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oznur Alkan, Massimiliano Mattetti, Elizabeth M. Daly, Inge Vejsbjerg, Adi Botea</p>
    <p>Recent research focuses beyond recommendation accuracy, towards human factors that influence the acceptance of recommendations, such as user satisfaction, trust, transparency and sense of control. We present a generic interactive recommender framework that can add interaction functionalities to non-interactive recommender systems. We take advantage of dialogue systems to interact with the user and we design a middleware layer to provide the interaction functions, such as providing explanations for the recommendations, managing users' preferences learnt from dialogue, preference elicitation and refining recommendations based on learnt preferences.</p>

    <h3>ExpLOD: A Framework for Explaining Recommendations based on the Linked Open Data Cloud (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fedelucio Narducci, Pasquale Lops, Marco De Gemmis, Giovanni Semeraro, Cataldo Musto</p>
    <p>In this paper we present ExpLOD, a framework which exploits the information available in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud to generate a natural language explanation of the suggestions produced by a recommendation algorithm. The methodology is based on building a graph in which the items liked by a user are connected to the items recommended through the properties available in the LOD cloud. Next, given this graph, we implemented some techniques to rank those properties and we used the most relevant ones to feed a module for generating explanations in natural language. In the experimental evaluation we performed a user study with 308 subjects aiming to investigate to what extent our explanation framework can lead to more transparent, trustful and engaging recommendations. The preliminary results provided us with encouraging findings, since our algorithm performed better than both a non-personalized explanation baseline and a popularity-based one.</p>
