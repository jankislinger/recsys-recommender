    <h3>Recommender Systems for Personalized User Experience: Lessons learned at Booking.com (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Kangas</p>
    <p>Booking.com is the world’s leading online travel platform where users make many decisions supported by our recommendations, such as destinations, travel dates, facilities, etc. This leads to a complex User Interface (UI) containing many widgets of different relevance for different users. We address the problem of constructing an optimal UI, a non-trivial problem, mainly due to user preferences evolving over time and multiple independent teams collaboratively building the UI. Our goal is to provide a personalized User Experience (UX) which adapts to changes in the environment and ensures governable, collaborative product development. The solution relies on a Multi Armed Bandits (MAB) framework currently allowing product teams to collaborate on the construction of UIs and serving millions of users every day. We present examples of our solution and lessons learned during their implementation.</p>

    <h3>History-Augmented Collaborative Filtering for Financial Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baptiste Barreau, Laurent Carlier</p>
    <p>In many businesses, and particularly in finance, the behavior of a client might drastically change over time. It is consequently crucial for recommender systems used in such environments to be able to adapt to these changes. In this study, we propose a novel collaborative filtering algorithm that captures the temporal context of a user-item interaction through the users’ and items’ recent interaction histories to provide dynamic recommendations. The algorithm, designed with issues specific to the financial world in mind, uses a custom neural network architecture that tackles the non-stationarity of users’ and items’ behaviors. The performance and properties of the algorithm are monitored in a series of experiments on a G10 bond request for quotation proprietary database from BNP Paribas Corporate and Institutional Banking.</p>

    <h3>Providing Explainable Race-Time Predictions and Training Plan Recommendations to Marathon Runners (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barry Smyth, Aonghus Lawlor, Brian Caulfield, Ciara Feely</p>
    <p>Millions of people participate in marathon events every year, typically devoting at least 12-16 weeks to building their endurance and fitness so that they can safely complete these gruelling 42.2km races. Most runners follow a training plan that is tailored to their expected finish-time (e.g. sub-4 hours or 4-5 hours), and these plans will prescribe a complex mixture of training sessions to help them achieve these times. However, such plans cannot adapt to the individual needs (fitness levels, changing goals, personal preferences) of runners, providing only broad training guidance rather than more personalised support. The development of wearable sensors and mobile fitness applications facilitates the collection of a large amount of training data from runners. In this paper, we propose a recommender system that utilizes such training data to deliver more personalised training advice to runners, using ideas from case-based reasoning to reuse and adapt the training habits of similar runners. Explainability plays a significant role in this type of system, and we also describe how the predictions and recommendation advice can be presented to runners. An initial off-line evaluation is presented based on a large-scale, real-world dataset.</p>
