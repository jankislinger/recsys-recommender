    <h3>Gradient Matching for Categorical Data Distillation in CTR Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixuan Li, Zhenhua Dong, Jiacheng Sun, Cheng Wang, Rui Zhang</p>
    <p>The cost of hardware and energy consumption on training a click-through rate (CTR) model is highly prohibitive. A recent promising direction for reducing such costs is data distillation with gradient matching, which aims to synthesize a small distilled dataset to guide the model to a similar parameter space as those trained on real data. However, there are two main challenges to implementing such a method in the recommendation field: (1) The categorical recommended data are high dimensional and sparse one- or multi-hot data which will block the gradient flow, causing backpropagation-based data distillation invalid. (2) The data distillation process with gradient matching is computationally expensive due to the bi-level optimization. To this end, we investigate efficient data distillation tailored for recommendation data with plenty of side information where we formulate the discrete data to the dense and continuous data format. Then, we further introduce a one-step gradient matching scheme, which performs gradient matching for only a single step to overcome the inefficient training process. The overall proposed method is called Categorical data distillation with Gradient Matching (CGM), which is capable of distilling a large dataset into a small of informative synthetic data for training CTR models from scratch. Experimental results show that our proposed method not only outperforms the state-of-the-art coreset selection and data distillation methods but also has remarkable cross-architecture performance. Moreover, we explore the application of CGM on continual updating and mitigate the effect of different random seeds on the training results.</p>

    <h3>Efficient Similarity Computation for Collaborative Filtering in Dynamic Environments (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Jeunen, Bart Goethals, Koen Verstrepen</p>
    <p>The problem of computing all pairwise similarities in a large collection of vectors is a well-known and common data mining task. As the number and dimensionality of these vectors keeps increasing, however, currently existing approaches are often unable to meet the strict efficiency requirements imposed by the environments they need to perform in. Real-time neighbourhood-based collaborative filtering (CF) is one example of such an environment in which performance is critical. In this work, we present a novel algorithm for efficient and exact similarity computation between sparse, high-dimensional vectors. Our approach exploits the sparsity that is inherent to implicit feedback data-streams, entailing significant gains compared to other methods. Furthermore, as our model learns incrementally, it is naturally suited for dynamic real-time CF environments. We propose a MapReduce-inspired parallellisation procedure along with our method, and show how even more speed-up can be achieved. Additionally, in many real-world systems, many items are actually not recommendable at any given time, due to recency, stock, seasonality, or enforced business rules. We exploit this fact to further improve the computational efficiency of our approach. Experimental evaluation on both real-world and publicly available datasets shows that our approach scales up to millions of processed user-item interactions per second, and well advances the state-of-the-art. ,</p>
