    <h3>Knowledge-Aware Recommender Systems based on Multi-Modal Information Sources (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giuseppe Spillo</p>
    <p>The last few years saw a growing interest in Knowledge-Aware Recommender Systems (KARSs), given their capability in encoding and exploiting several data sources, both structured (such as <i>knowledge graphs</i>) and unstructured (such as plain text); indeed, several pieces of research show the competitiveness of these models. Nowadays, a lot of models at the state-of-the-art in KARSs use deep learning, enabling them to exploit large amounts of information, including knowledge graphs (KGs), user reviews, plain text, and multimedia content (pictures, audio, videos). In my Ph.D. I will explore and study techniques for designing KARSs leveraging embeddings deriving from multi-modal information sources; the models I will design will aim at providing fair, accurate, and explainable recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Quality Metrics in Recommender Systems: Do We Calculate Metrics Consistently? (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rinchin Damdinov, Alexey Vasilev, Yan-Martin Tamm</p>
    <p>Offline evaluation is a popular approach to determine the best algorithm in terms of the chosen quality metric. However, if the chosen metric calculates something unexpected, this miscommunication can lead to poor decisions and wrong conclusions. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate quality metrics used for recommender systems evaluation. We look at the practical aspect of implementations found in modern RecSys libraries and at the theoretical aspect of definitions in academic papers. We find that Precision is the only metric universally understood among papers and libraries, while other metrics may have different interpretations. Metrics implemented in different libraries sometimes have the same name but measure different things, which leads to different results given the same input. When defining metrics in an academic paper, authors sometimes omit explicit formulations or give references that do not contain explanations either. In 47% of cases, we cannot easily know how the metric is defined because the definition is not clear or absent. These findings highlight yet another difficulty in recommender system evaluation and call for a more detailed description of evaluation protocols.</p>

    <h3>Using Citation-Context to Reduce Topic Drifting on Pure Citation-Based Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anita Khadka, Petr Knoth</p>
    <p>Recent works in the area of academic recommender systems have demonstrated the effectiveness of co-citation and citation closeness in related-document recommendations. However, documents recommended from such systems may drift away from the main concept of the query document. In this work, we investigate whether incorporating the textual information in close proximity to a citation as well as the citation position could reduce such drifting and further increase the performance of the recommender system. To investigate this, we run experiments with several recommendation methods on a newly created and now publicly available dataset containing 53 million unique citation based records. We then conduct a user-based evaluation with domain-knowledgeable participants. Our results show that a new method based on the combination of Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA), topic modelling and word embeddings achieve more than 20% improvement in Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) compared to CPA.</p>
