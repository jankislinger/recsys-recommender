    <h3>RecQR: Using Recommendation Systems for Query Reformulation to correct unseen errors in spoken dialog systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleg Poliannikov, Mingxian Wang, Manik Bhandari, Kanna Shimizu</p>
    <p>As spoken dialog systems like Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant become widespread, it becomes apparent that relying solely on global, one-size-fits-all models of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Entity Resolution (ER), is inadequate for delivering a friction-less customer experience. To address this issue, Query Reformulation (QR) has emerged as a crucial technique for personalizing these systems and reducing customer friction. However, existing QR models, trained on personal rephrases in history face a critical drawback – they are unable to reformulate unseen queries to unseen targets. To alleviate this, we present RecQR, a novel system based on collaborative filters, designed to reformulate unseen defective requests to target requests that a customer may never have requested for in the past. RecQR anticipates a customer’s future requests and rewrites them using state of the art, large-scale, collaborative filtering and query reformulation models. Based on experiments we find that it reduces errors by nearly 40% (relative) on the reformulated utterances.</p>

    <h3>Automate Page Template Optimization: An Offline Deep Q-Learning Approach (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenyang Liu, Zhou Qin</p>
    <p>The modern e-commerce web pages have brought better customer experience and more profitable services by whole page optimization at different granularity, e.g., page layout optimization, item ranking optimization, etc. Generating the proper page layout per customer’s request is one of the vital tasks during the web page rendering process, which can directly impact customers’ shopping experience and their decision-making. In this paper, we formulate the request-rendering interactions as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it by deep reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we present the design and implementation of applying offline Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to the contextual page layout optimization problem. Through the offline evaluation method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, i.e., the RL agent has the potential to perform better than the baseline ranker by learning from the offline data set, e.g., the RL agent can improve the average cumulative rewards up to 36.69% comparing to the baseline ranker.</p>

    <h3>Behavior-based Popularity Ranking on Amazon Video (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lakshmi Ramachandran</p>
    <p>With the growth in the number of video streaming services, providers have to strive hard to make relevant content available and keep customers engaged. A good experience would help customers discover new and popular videos to stream with ease. Customer streaming behavior tends to be a strong indicator of whether they found a video engaging. Aggregate customer behavior serves as a useful predictor of popularity. We discuss the use of past streaming behavior to learn patterns and predict a video’s popularity using tree ensembles.</p>

    <h3>Cosibon: An e-Commerce Like Platform Enabling Bricks-and-Mortar Stores to Use Sophisticated Product Recommender Systems (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthias Raffelsieper, Thorben Keller</p>
    <p>Compared to online-retailers, bricks-and-mortar stores have only limited possibilities to understand consumer preferences, their intentions, and their feedback. The first are able to evaluate clickstream data collected on their webpages alongside the actual purchase data to put together a comprehensive view on individual customers. Bricks-and-mortar stores on the other hand have to rely solely on the evaluation of scanner data collected at the point of sale. Thus, akin to the Event Horizon in physics, describing the boundary beyond which events are unobservable, we introduce the term Receipt Horizon to describe the natural boundary beyond which a retailing company is unable to observe the behavior of individual customers. In this demo paper we present our comprehensive approach on how bricks-and-mortar stores can go beyond the Receipt Horizon. We demonstrate how existing customer loyalty programs can be leveraged by an extensive mobile app, transferring proven ecommerce concepts to physical retailers and collecting numerous novel information about consumers.</p>
