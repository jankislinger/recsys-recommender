    <h3>OutRank: Speeding up AutoML-based Model Search for Large Sparse Data sets with Cardinality-aware Feature Ranking (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Blaž Škrlj, Blaž Mramor</p>
    <p>The design of modern recommender systems relies on understanding which parts of the feature space are relevant for solving a given recommendation task. However, real-world data sets in this domain are often characterized by their large size, sparsity, and noise, making it challenging to identify meaningful signals. Feature ranking represents an efficient branch of algorithms that can help address these challenges by identifying the most informative features and facilitating the automated search for more compact and better-performing models (AutoML). We introduce OutRank, a system for versatile feature ranking and data quality-related anomaly detection. OutRank was built with categorical data in mind, utilizing a variant of mutual information that is normalized with regard to the noise produced by features of the same cardinality. We further extend the similarity measure by incorporating information on feature similarity and combined relevance. The proposed approach’s feasibility is demonstrated by speeding up the state-of-the-art AutoML system on a synthetic data set with no performance loss. Furthermore, we considered a real-life click-through-rate prediction data set where it outperformed strong baselines such as random forest-based approaches. The proposed approach enables exploration of up to 300% larger feature spaces compared to AutoML-only approaches, enabling faster search for better models on off-the-shelf hardware.</p>

    <h3>Uncertainty-adjusted Inductive Matrix Completion with Graph Neural Networks (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Ledent, Petr Kasalicky, Rodrigo Alves</p>
    <p>We propose a robust recommender systems model which performs matrix completion and a ratings-wise uncertainty estimation jointly. Whilst the prediction module is purely based on an implicit low-rank assumption imposed via nuclear norm regularization, our loss function is augmented by an uncertainty estimation module which learns an anomaly score for each individual rating via a Graph Neural Network: data points deemed more anomalous by the GNN are downregulated in the loss function used to train the low-rank module. The whole model is trained in an end-to-end fashion, allowing the anomaly detection module to tap on the supervised information available in the form of ratings. Thus, our model’s predictors enjoy the favourable generalization properties that come with being chosen from small function space (i.e., low-rank matrices), whilst exhibiting the robustness to outliers and flexibility that comes with deep learning methods. Furthermore, the anomaly scores themselves contain valuable qualitative information. Experiments on various real-life datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms standard matrix completion and other baselines, confirming the usefulness of the anomaly detection module.</p>

    <h3>FineNet: A Joint Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Network Model to Forecast and Recommend Anomalous Financial Items (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Che Tsai, You-Jia Chen, Chih-Yao Chen, Cheng-Te Li, Pei-Chi Wang, Shao-Lun Ma, Yu-Chieh Chang</p>
    <p>Financial technology (FinTech) draws much attention in these years, with the advances of machine learning and deep learning. In this work, given historical time series of stock prices of companies, we aim at forecasting upcoming anomalous financial items, i.e., abrupt soaring or diving stocks, in financial time series, and recommending the corresponding stocks to support financial operations. We propose a novel joint convolutional and recurrent neural network model, Financial Event Neural Network (FineNet), to forecast and recommend anomalous stocks. Experiments conducted on the time series of stock prices of 300 well-known companies exhibit the promising performance of FineNet in terms of precision and recall. We build FineNet as a Web platform for live demonstration.</p>

    <h3>Quick and Accurate Attack Detection in Recommender Systems through User Attributes (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ismail Uysal, Yasin Yilmaz, Mehmet Aktukmak</p>
    <p>Malicious profiles have been a credible threat to collaborative recommender systems. Attackers provide fake item ratings to systematically manipulate the platform. Attack detection algorithms can identify and remove such users by observing rating distributions. In this study, we aim to use the user attributes as an additional information source to improve the accuracy and speed of attack detection. We propose a probabilistic factorization model which can embed mixed data type user attributes and observed ratings into a latent space to generate anomaly statistics for new users. To identify the persistent outliers in the system, we also propose a sequential attack detection algorithm to enable quick and accurate detection based on the probabilistic model learned from genuine users. The proposed model demonstrates significant improvements in both accuracy and speed when compared to baseline algorithms on a popular benchmark dataset.</p>

    <h3>Securing Tag-based recommender systems against profile injection attacks: A comparative study (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heri Ramampiaro, Helge Langseth, Georgios Pitsilis</p>
    <p>This work addresses challenges related to attacks on social tagging systems, which often comes in a form of malicious annotations or profile injection attacks. In particular, we study various countermeasures against two types of threats for such systems, the Overload and the Piggyback attacks. The studied countermeasures include baseline classifiers such as, Naive Bayes filter and Support Vector Machine, as well as a deep learning-based approach. Our evaluation performed over synthetic spam data, generated from del.icio.us, shows that in most cases, the deep learning-based approach provides the best protection against threats.</p>
