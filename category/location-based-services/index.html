    <h3>SeCor: Aligning Semantic and Collaborative representations by Large Language Models for Next-Point-of-Interest Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling Ding, Yang Xiang, Jianting Chen, Shirui Wang, Xiaoying Gao, Bohan Xie</p>
    <p>The widespread adoption of location-based applications has created a growing demand for point-of-interest (POI) recommendation, which aims to predict a user’s next POI based on their historical check-in data and current location. However, existing methods often struggle to capture the intricate relationships within check-in data. This is largely due to their limitations in representing temporal and spatial information and underutilizing rich semantic features. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful semantic comprehension to solve them, they are limited by hallucination and the inability to incorporate global collaborative information. To address these issues, we propose a novel method SeCor, which treats POI recommendation as a multi-modal task and integrates semantic and collaborative representations to form an efficient hybrid encoding. SeCor first employs a basic collaborative filtering model to mine interaction features. These embeddings, as one modal information, are fed into LLM to align with semantic representation, leading to efficient hybrid embeddings. To mitigate the hallucination, SeCor recommends based on the hybrid embeddings rather than directly using the LLM’s output text. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that SeCor outperforms all baselines, achieving improved recommendation performance by effectively integrating collaborative and semantic information through LLMs.</p>

    <h3>Scene-wise Adaptive Network for Dynamic Cold-start Scenes Optimization in CTR Prediction (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Tang, Wenhao Li, Jie Zhou, Shixiong Zhao, Chuan Luo, Kun Zhang</p>
    <p>In the realm of modern mobile E-commerce, providing users with nearby commercial service recommendations through location-based online services has become increasingly vital. While machine learning approaches have shown promise in multi-scene recommendation, existing methodologies often struggle to address cold-start problems in unprecedented scenes: the increasing diversity of commercial choices, along with the short online lifespan of scenes, give rise to the complexity of effective recommendations in online and dynamic scenes. In this work, we propose Scene-wise Adaptive Network (SwAN), a novel approach that emphasizes high-performance cold-start online recommendations for new scenes. Our approach introduces several crucial capabilities, including scene similarity learning, user-specific scene transition cognition, scene-specific information construction for the new scene, and enhancing the diverged logical information between scenes. We demonstrate SwAN’s potential to optimize dynamic multi-scene recommendation problems by effectively online handling cold-start recommendations for any newly arrived scenes. More encouragingly, SwAN has been successfully deployed in Company M’s online catering recommendation service, which serves millions of customers per day, and SwAN has achieved a 5.64% CTR index improvement relative to the baselines and a 5.19% increase in daily order volume proportion.</p>

    <h3>Exploring the Impact of Temporal Bias in Point-of-Interest Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Tourani, Hossein A. Rahmani, Yashar Deldjoo, Mohammadmehdi Naghiaei</p>
    <p>Recommending appropriate travel destinations to consumers based on contextual information such as their check-in time and location is a primary objective of Point-of-Interest (POI) recommender systems. However, the issue of contextual bias (i.e., how much consumers prefer one situation over another) has received little attention from the research community. This paper examines the effect of temporal bias, defined as the difference between users’ check-in hours, leisure vs. work hours, on the consumer-side fairness of context-aware recommendation algorithms. We believe that eliminating this type of temporal (and geographical) bias might contribute to a drop in traffic-related air pollution, noting that rush-hour traffic may be more congested. To surface effective POI recommendation, we evaluated the sensitivity of state-of-the-art context-aware models to the temporal bias contained in users’ check-in activities on two POI datasets, namely Gowalla and Yelp. The findings show that the examined context-aware recommendation models prefer one group of users over another based on the time of check-in and that this preference persists even when users have the same amount of interactions.</p>

    <h3>Geographical Diversification in POI Recommendation: Toward Improved Coverage on Interested Areas (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jungkyu Han, Hayato Yamana</p>
    <p>In recommending POIs, the accuracy is important. However, merely accurate recommendations are useless in real life. Thus, beyond accuracy – such as the diversity of the recommended POIs – is as important as accuracy for a good recommendation. Although existing diversification methods can help POI recommender systems recommend more diverse POIs, they lack “geographical diversification” that results in concentration of “diverse” recommended POIs on “a small portion” of the most active areas of the target-user. This is caused by the neglect of POI locations in the diversification i.e., existing diversification methods try to diversify the categories of recommended items (POIs). However, geographical diversification is indispensable for the user whose activity district consists of many sub-areas and who requires variety of recommended POIs over his/her activity sub-areas. In this paper, we propose a novel proportional geographical diversification method to recommend variety of POIs located in his/her activity district but variety of sub-areas in the district proportional to the frequency of his/her activity to each sub-area. We compared our proposed method with existing diversification methods with real datasets. The evaluation result shows that no methods except for our proposed method can significantly increase geographical diversity at the expense of tolerable accuracy loss.</p>

    <h3>Detecting Trending Venues Using Foursquare’s Data (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stephanie Yang, Max Sklar</p>
    <p>Foursquare is a search and discovery tool which helps users discover venues around the world. Much of the data for these recommendations come from its sister app Swarm, which is a location based social network where users can “check in” to places they visit. Older versions of Foursquare had a strongly static component to its recommendations. For instance, the top restaurants in New York City do not vary from month to month, and venues with years of consistently strong signals will dominate search results. In this paper we outline a new algorithm which Foursquare uses in order to discover fresh recommendations. Promoting younger venues with fewer check-ins or older venues with a recent surge of activity increases turnover in our recommen- dations and yields a better user experience</p>

    <h3>Event Recommendation using Twitter Activity (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deepa Mallela, Axel Magnuson, Vijay Dialani</p>
    <p>User interactions with Twitter (social network) frequently take place on mobile devices – a user base that it strongly caters to. As much of Twitter’s traffic comes with geotagging information associated with it, it is a natural platform for geographic recommendations. This paper proposes an event recommender system for Twitter users, which identifies twitter activity co-located with previous events, and uses it to drive geographic recommendations via item-based collaborative filtering.</p>
