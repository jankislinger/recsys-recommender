    <h3>Informfully – Research Platform for Reproducible User Studies (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian A. Croci, Madhav Sachdeva, Abraham Bernstein, Lucien Heitz</p>
    <p>This paper presents Informfully, a research platform for content distribution and user studies. Informfully allows to push algorithmically curated text, image, audio, and video content to users and automatically generates a detailed log of their consumption history. As such, it serves as an open-source platform for conducting user experiments to investigate the impact of item recommendations on users’ consumption behavior. The platform was designed to accommodate different experiment types through versatility, ease of use, and scalability. It features three core components: 1) a front end for displaying and interacting with recommended items, 2) a back end for researchers to create and maintain user experiments, and 3) a simple JSON-based exchange format for ranked item recommendations  to interface with third-party frameworks. We provide a system overview and outline the three core components of the platform. A sample workflow is shown for conducting field studies incorporating multiple user groups, personalizing recommendations, and measuring the effect of algorithms on user engagement. We present evidence for the versatility, ease of use, and scalability of Informfully by showcasing previous studies that used our platform.</p>

    <h3>Integrating Matrix Factorization with Graph based Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rachana Mehta</p>
    <p>Graph based Recommender models make use of user-item rating and user-user social relationships to elicit recommendation performance by extracting inherent geometrical knowledge. In a social graph scenario, user-user trust plays a significant role in reducing sparsity and has varied characteristics that can be exploited. Existing models limit themselves to learning from either a high order interaction graph of user-item ratings or a user-user social graph from trust value. They explore other trust characteristics in a very limited setting. The graph based model, designed using entire user-user social information, impacts performance and escalates complexities in model learning. To alleviate these issues of graph learning, graph recommender seeks assistance from matrix factorization techniques. Incorporating graph based model with matrix factorization brings its own set of challenges of model integration, leveraging trust, graph learning, and optimization. This article presents the existing work in that line and future possibilities and challenges to be catered to through novel developments</p>
