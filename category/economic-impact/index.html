    <h3>Towards Sustainable Recommendations in Urban Tourism (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel Merinov</p>
    <p>In the context of urban tourism promotion, I am exploring how recommender systems (RSs) can personalise information in order to shift tourists behaviour from typically popularity-biased towards more niche and urban-friendly. This problem has a great importance in sustainability online promotion campaigns. Urban destination managers strive to prevent overcrowding at popular points of interest (POIs), by attracting visitors to less popular POIs, while still providing personalised access to information. It is assumed, that this approach will maintain a healthy distribution of tourists in a city; both reducing tourist congestion, and, considering each POI as a local business, maintaining the long-term economic viability in a city. This problem has already received some attention in the literature, targeting major European touristic cities. However, many complex issues still need to be resolved for a comprehensive solution. In this extended abstract, I highlight open research problems, and identify key research questions (RQs) that are crucial for advancing sustainable tourism development leveraging RSs. Although the proposed methods are focused on urban tourism, their application extends to different areas of recommendations because the RQs and the proposed methods and techniques are general.</p>

    <h3>Selection and Ordering of Linear Online Video Ads (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Viswanathan Swaminathan, Wreetabrata Kar, Paulo Albuquerque</p>
    <p>This paper studies the selection and ordering of in-stream ads in videos shown in online content publishers. We propose an allocation algorithm that uses a collective measure of price and quality for each ad and factors in slot-specific continuation probabilities to maximize publisher revenue. The algorithm is based on cascade models and uses a dynamic programming method to assign linear (video) ads to slots in an online video. The approach accounts for the negative externality created by lower quality ads placed in a video, leading to viewer exit and thereby preventing the publisher from showing the subsequent ads scheduled in that session. Our algorithm is scalable and suited for real-time applications. A large log of viewer activity from a video ad platform is used to empirically test the algorithm. A series of simulations show that our algorithm, when compared to other algorithms currently practiced in industry, generates more revenue for the publisher and increases viewer retention.</p>
