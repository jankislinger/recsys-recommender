    <h3>DREAM: Decoupled Representation via Extraction Attention Module and Supervised Contrastive Learning for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommender (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoxin Ye, Yun Li, Lina Yao</p>
    <p>Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation(CDSR) aims to generate accurate predictions for future interactions by leveraging users’ cross-domain historical interactions.  One major challenge of CDSR is how to jointly learn the single- and cross-domain user preferences efficiently. To enhance the target domain’s performance, most existing solutions start by learning the single-domain user preferences within each domain and then transferring the acquired knowledge from the rich domain to the target domain. However, this approach ignores the inter-sequence item relationship and also limits the opportunities for target domain knowledge to enhance the rich domain performance. Moreover, it also ignores the information within the cross-domain sequence. Despite cross-domain sequences being generally noisy and hard to learn directly, they contain valuable user behavior patterns with great potential to enhance performance. Another key challenge of CDSR is data sparsity, which also exists in other recommendation system problems. In the real world, the data distribution of the recommendation system is highly skewed to the popular products, especially on the large-scale dataset with millions of users and items. One more challenge is the class imbalance problem, inherited by the Sequential Recommendation problem. Generally, each sample only has one positive and thousands of negative samples. To address the above problems together, an innovative Decoupled Representation via Extraction Attention Module (DREAM) is proposed for CDSR to simultaneously learn single- and cross-domain user preference via decoupled representations. A novel Supervised Contrastive Learning framework is introduced to model the inter-sequence relationship as well as address the data sparsity via data augmentations. DREAM also leverages Focal Loss to put more weight on misclassified samples to address the class-imbalance problem, with another uplift on the overall model performance. Extensive experiments had been conducted on two cross-domain recommendation datasets, demonstrating DREAM outperforms various SOTA cross-domain recommendation algorithms achieving up to a 75% uplift in Movie-Book Scenarios.</p>
