    <h3>Pairwise Intent Graph Embedding Learning for Context-Aware Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhao Wu, Zhong Ming, Xiaolian Zhang, Hao Wang, Qinjuan Yang, Dugang Liu, Weixin Li</p>
    <p>Although knowledge graph have shown their effectiveness in mitigating data sparsity in many recommendation tasks, they remain underutilized in context-aware recommender systems (CARS) with the specific sparsity challenges associated with the contextual features, i.e., feature sparsity and interaction sparsity. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel pairwise intent graph embedding learning (PING) framework to efficiently integrate knowledge graph into CARS. Specifically, our PING contains three modules: 1) a graph construction module is used to obtain a pairwise intent graph (PIG) containing nodes for users, items, entities and enhanced intent, where enhanced intent nodes are generated by applying user intent fusion (UIF) on relational intent and contextual intent, and two sub-intents are derived from the semantic information and contextual information, respectively; 2) a pairwise intent joint graph convolution module is used to obtain the refined embeddings of all the features by executing a customized convolution strategy on PIG, where each enhanced intent node acts as a hub to efficiently propagate information among different features and between all the features and knowledge graph; 3) a recommendation module with the refined embeddings is used to replace the randomly initialized embeddings of downstream recommendation models to improve model performance. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to verify the effectiveness and compatibility of our PING.</p>

    <h3>Generative Next-Basket Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqi Sun, Ji-Rong Wen, Ruobing Xie, Junjie Zhang, Leyu Lin, Wayne Xin Zhao</p>
    <p>Next-basket Recommendation (NBR) refers to the task of predicting a set of items that a user will purchase in the next basket. However, most of existing works merely focus on the relevance between user preferences and predicted items, ignoring the essential relationships among items in the next basket, which often results in over-homogenization of items. In this work, we presents a novel Generative next-basket Recommendation model (GeRec), a new NBR paradigm that generates the recommended items one by one to form the next basket via an autoregressive decoder. This generative NBR paradigm contributes to capturing and considering item relationships inside each baskets in both training and serving. Moreover, we jointly consider user’s both item- and basket-level contextual information to better capture user’s multi-granularity preferences. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</p>

    <h3>Large-Scale Modeling of Mobile User Click Behaviors Using Deep Learning (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Li, Xin Zhou</p>
    <p>Modeling tap or click sequences of users on a mobile device can improve our understandings of interaction behavior and offers opportunities for UI optimization by recommending next element the user might want to click on. We analyzed a large-scale dataset of over 20 million clicks from more than 4,000 mobile users who opted in. We then designed a deep learning model that predicts the next element that the user clicks given the user’s click history, the structural information of the UI screen, and the current context such as the time of the day. We thoroughly investigated the deep model by comparing it with a set of baseline methods based on the dataset. The experiments show that our model achieves 48% and 71% accuracy (top-1 and top-3) for predicting next clicks based on a held-out dataset of test users, which significantly outperformed all the baseline methods with a large margin. We discussed a few scenarios for integrating the model in mobile interaction and how users can potentially benefit from the model.</p>

    <h3>A Probabilistic Model for Intrusive Recommendation Assessment (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rim Faiz, Mohand Boughanem, Imen Akermi</p>
    <p>The overwhelming advances in mobile technologies allow recommender systems to be highly contextualized and able to deliver recommendation without an explicit request. However, it is no longer enough for a recommender system to determine what to recommend according to the users’ needs, but it also has to deal with the risk of disturbing the user during recommendation. We believe that mobile technologies along with contextual information may help alleviate this issue. In this paper, we address intrusiveness as a probabilistic approach that makes use of the several embedded applications within the user’s device and the user’s contextual information in order to figure out intrusive recommendations that are subject to rejection. The experiments that we conducted have shown that the proposed approach yields promising results.</p>
