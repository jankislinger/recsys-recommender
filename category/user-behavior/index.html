    <h3>LLMs for User Interest Exploration: A Hybrid Approach (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> He Ma, Haokai Lu, Yueqi Wang, Yifan Liu, Ed H. Chi, Lexi Baugher, Ningren Han, Shuzhou Zhang, Yang Gu, Jianling Wang, Minmin Chen, Shuchao Bi</p>
    <p>Traditional recommendation systems are subject to a strong feedback loop by learning from and reinforcing past user-item interactions, which in turn limits the discovery of novel user interests. To address this, we introduce a hybrid hierarchical framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and classic recommendation models for user interest exploration. The framework controls the interfacing between the LLMs and the classic recommendation models through “interest clusters”, the granularity of which can be explicitly determined by algorithm designers. It recommends the next novel interests by first representing “interest clusters” using language, and employs a fine-tuned LLM to generate novel interest descriptions that are strictly within these predefined clusters. At the low level, it grounds these generated interests to an item-level policy by restricting classic recommendation models, in this case a transformer-based sequence recommender to return items that fall within the novel clusters generated at the high level. We showcase the efficacy of this approach on an industrial-scale commercial platform serving billions of users. Live experiments show a significant increase in both exploration of novel interests and overall user enjoyment of the platform.</p>

    <h3>The Fault in Our Recommendations: On the Perils of Optimizing the Measurable (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshit Kumar, Yash Kanoria, Omar Besbes</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems play a pivotal role on digital platforms by curating content, products and services for users. These systems are widespread, and through customized recommendations, promise to match users with options they will like. To that end,  data on engagement is collected and used, with, e.g., measurements of clicks, but also  purchases or consumption times.   Most recommendation systems are ranking-based, where they rank and recommend items based on their predicted engagement.  However, the engagement signals  are often only a crude proxy for user utility, as data on the latter is rarely collected or available. This paper explores the following critical research question: By optimizing for measurable proxies, are recommendation systems at risk of significantly under-delivering on user utility? If that is indeed the case, how can one improve utility which is seldom measured? To study these questions, we introduce a model of repeated user consumption in which, at each interaction, users select between an outside option and the best option from a recommendation set. Our model accounts for user heterogeneity, with the majority preferring “popular” content, and a minority favoring “niche” content. The system initially lacks knowledge of individual user preferences but can learn these preferences through observations of users’ choices over time. Our theoretical and numerical analysis demonstrate that optimizing for engagement signals can lead to significant utility losses. Instead, we propose a utility-aware policy that initially recommends a mix of popular and niche content. We show that such a policy substantially improves  utility despite not measuring it. In fact, in the limit of a forward-looking platform with discount factor $\delta \to 1$, our utility-aware policy achieves the best of both worlds: near-optimal user utility and near-optimal engagement simultaneously. Our study elucidates  an important feature of recommendation systems; given the ability to suggest multiple items, one can perform significant exploration without incurring significant reductions in short term engagement. By recommending high-risk, high-reward items alongside popular items, systems can enhance discovery of high utility items without significantly affecting engagement.</p>

    <h3>Oh, Behave! Country Representation Dynamics Created by Feedback Loops in Music Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Kowald, Markus Schedl, Oleg Lesota, Jonas Geiger, Max Walder</p>
    <p>Recent work suggests that music recommender systems are prone to disproportionally frequent recommendations of music from countries more prominently represented in the training data, notably the US. However, it remains unclear to what extent feedback loops in music recommendation influence the dynamics of such imbalance. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of representation of local (i.e., country-specific) and US-produced music in user profiles and recommendations. To this end, we conduct a feedback loop simulation study using the standardized LFM-2b dataset. The results suggest that most of the investigated recommendation models decrease the proportion of music from local artists in their recommendations. Furthermore, we find that models preserving average proportions of US and local music do not necessarily provide country-calibrated recommendations. We also look into popularity calibration and, surprisingly, find that the most popularity-calibrated model in our study (ItemKNN) provides the least country-calibrated recommendations. In addition, users from less represented countries (e.g., Finland) are, in the long term, most affected by the under-representation of their local music in recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Context-based Entity Recommendation for Knowledge Workers: Establishing a Benchmark on Real-life Data (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahta Bakhshizadeh, Heiko Maus, Andreas Dengel</p>
    <p>In recent decades, recommender systems have undergone significant advancements, particularly in popular domains like movies, music, and product recommendations. Yet, progress has been notably slower in leveraging these systems for personal information management and knowledge assistance. In addition to challenges that complicate the adoption of recommender systems in this domain (such as privacy concerns, heterogeneous recommendation items, and frequent context switching), a significant barrier to progress in this area has been the absence of a standardized benchmark for researchers to evaluate their approaches. In response to this gap, this paper presents a benchmark built upon a publicly available dataset of real-life knowledge work in context (RLKWiC). This benchmark focuses on evaluating context-based entity recommendation, a use case for leveraging recommender systems to support knowledge workers in their daily digital tasks. By providing this benchmark, it is aimed to facilitate and accelerate research efforts in enhancing personal knowledge assistance through recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>What to compare? Towards understanding user sessions on price comparison platforms (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Neidhardt, Ahmadou Wagne</p>
    <p>E-commerce and online shopping have become integral to the lives of many, with various user behavior types historically identified. Beyond deciding what to buy, determining where to make a purchase has led to the importance of price comparison platforms. However, user behavior on these platforms remains underexplored. Furthermore, web analytics often struggle with tracking users over time and deriving meaningful user types from data. This paper addresses these gaps by defining session types through the analysis and clustering of user logs from a major price comparison platform. The study identifies six distinct session clusters: quick peek, major purchase, constraint-based browsing, knowledge seeking, search and browse and heavy browsing. These findings are intended to inform the design and development of a conversational recommender system (CRS). Often, CRS development occurs without adequate consideration of the existing system into which it will be integrated. The study’s findings, derived from both quantitative analysis and expert interviews, provide valuable contributions, including identified session clusters, their interpretation and indicators on which users might benefit from a CRS on these platforms.</p>

    <h3>The MovieLens Beliefs Dataset: Collecting Pre-Choice Data for Online Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guy Aridor, Duarte Goncalves, Daniel Kluver, Ruoyan Kong, Joseph Konstan</p>
    <p>An increasingly important aspect of designing recommender systems involves considering how recommendations will influence consumer choices. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a method for collecting user beliefs about un-experienced items – a critical predictor of choice behavior. We implemented this method on the MovieLens platform, resulting in a rich dataset that combines user ratings, beliefs, and observed recommendations. We document challenges to such data collection, including selection bias in response and limited coverage of the product space. This unique resource empowers researchers to delve deeper into user behavior and analyze user choices absent recommendations, measure the effectiveness of recommendations, and prototype algorithms that leverage user belief data, ultimately leading to more impactful recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Touch the Core: Exploring Task Dependence Among Hybrid Targets for Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiuqiang He, Xing Tang, Dugang Liu, Yang Qiao, Fuyuan Lyu</p>
    <p>As user behaviors become complicated on business platforms, online recommendations focus more on how to touch the core conversions, which are highly related to the interests of platforms. These core conversions are usually continuous targets, such as watch time, revenue, and so on, whose predictions can be enhanced by previous discrete conversion actions. Therefore, multi-task learning (MTL) can be adopted as the paradigm to learn these hybrid targets. However, existing works mainly emphasize investigating the sequential dependence among discrete conversion actions, which neglects the complexity of dependence between discrete conversions and the final continuous conversion. Moreover, simultaneously optimizing hybrid tasks with stronger task dependence will suffer from volatile issues where the core regression task might have a larger influence on other tasks. In this paper, we study the MTL problem with hybrid targets for the first time and propose the model named Hybrid Targets Learning Network (HTLNet) to explore task dependence and enhance optimization. Specifically, we introduce label embedding for each task to explicitly transfer the label information among these tasks, which can effectively explore logical task dependence. We also further design the gradient adjustment regime between the final regression task and other classification tasks to enhance the optimization. Extensive experiments on two offline public datasets and one real-world industrial dataset are conducted to validate the effectiveness of HTLNet. Moreover, online A/B tests on the financial recommender system also show our model has superior improvement.</p>

    <h3>Informfully – Research Platform for Reproducible User Studies (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian A. Croci, Madhav Sachdeva, Abraham Bernstein, Lucien Heitz</p>
    <p>This paper presents Informfully, a research platform for content distribution and user studies. Informfully allows to push algorithmically curated text, image, audio, and video content to users and automatically generates a detailed log of their consumption history. As such, it serves as an open-source platform for conducting user experiments to investigate the impact of item recommendations on users’ consumption behavior. The platform was designed to accommodate different experiment types through versatility, ease of use, and scalability. It features three core components: 1) a front end for displaying and interacting with recommended items, 2) a back end for researchers to create and maintain user experiments, and 3) a simple JSON-based exchange format for ranked item recommendations  to interface with third-party frameworks. We provide a system overview and outline the three core components of the platform. A sample workflow is shown for conducting field studies incorporating multiple user groups, personalizing recommendations, and measuring the effect of algorithms on user engagement. We present evidence for the versatility, ease of use, and scalability of Informfully by showcasing previous studies that used our platform.</p>

    <h3>It’s (not) all about that CTR: A Multi-Stakeholder Perspective on News Recommender Metrics (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanne Vandenbroucke, Annelien Smets</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems are increasingly adopted by news media organizations. Existing literature examines various aspects of news recommendation systems (NRS) from a computational, user-centric, or normative perspective. Yet, scholars have argued to study the complexity of real-world applications surrounding the development and evaluation of NRS. More specifically, understand why different stakeholders within the organization prioritize different values for developing NRS and how those values are operationalized into metrics. Recently, a multi-stakeholder approach to NRS has been adopted, allowing to capture this complexity more comprehensively. However, limited research has focused on the distinct key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics considered valuable by different stakeholders in evaluating NRS. Based on 11 interviews conducted with different professionals from two commercial media organizations in Flanders and The Netherlands, this paper shows that stakeholders prioritize different KPIs and metrics related to the reach-engagement-conversion-retention funnel. The evaluation of NRS performance is often limited to short-term metrics like CTR, overlooking the multiplicity of stakeholders involved. Our findings reveal how different purposes, KPIs, and metrics are valued from the journalistic, commercial, and tech logic. In doing so, this paper contributes to the multi-stakeholder approach to NRS, advancing our understanding of the real-world complexity of NRS development and evaluation.</p>

    <h3>Disentangling Motives behind Item Consumption and Social Connection for Mutually-enhanced Joint Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yew Soon Ong, Jie Zhang, Zhu Sun, Youchen Sun, Xiao Sha</p>
    <p>Item consumption and social connection, as common user behaviors in many web applications, have been extensively studied. However, most current works separately perform either item or social link prediction tasks, possibly with the help of the other as an auxiliary signal. Moreover, they merely consider the behaviors in a holistic manner yet neglect the multi-faceted motives behind them (e.g., watching movies to kill time or with friends; connecting with others due to friendships or colleagues). To fill the gap, we propose to disentangle the multi-faceted motives in each network, defined respectively by the two types of behaviors, for mutually- enhanced joint prediction (DMJP). Specifically, we first learn the disentangled user representations driven by motives of multi-facets in both networks. Thereafter, the mutual influence of the two networks is subtly discriminated at the facet-to-facet level. The fine-grained mutual influence, proven to be asymmetric, is then exploited to help refine user representations in both networks, with the goal of achieving a mutually-enhanced joint item and social link prediction. Empirical studies on three public datasets showcase the superiority of DMJP against state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on both tasks.</p>

    <h3>Exploring Unlearning Methods to Ensure the Privacy, Security, and Usability of Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jens Leysen</p>
    <p>Machine learning algorithms have proven highly effective in analyzing large amounts of data and identifying complex patterns and relationships. One application of machine learning that has received significant attention in recent years is recommender systems, which are algorithms that analyze user behavior and other data to suggest items or content that a user may be interested in. However useful, these systems may unintentionally retain sensitive, outdated, or faulty information. Posing a risk to user privacy, system security, and limiting a system’s usability. In this research proposal, we aim to address these challenges by investigating methods for machine “unlearning”, which would allow information to be efficiently “forgotten” or “unlearned” from machine learning models. The main objective of this proposal is to develop the foundation for future machine unlearning methods. We first evaluate current unlearning methods and explore novel adversarial attacks on these methods’ verifiability, efficiency, and accuracy to gain new insights and further develop the theory of machine unlearning. Using our gathered insights, we seek to create novel unlearning methods that are verifiable, efficient, and limit unnecessary accuracy degradation. Through this research, we seek to make significant contributions to the theoretical foundations of machine unlearning while also developing unlearning methods that can be applied to real-world problems.</p>

    <h3>Interface Design to Mitigate Inflation in Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rana Shahout, Nikhil Garg, Sasha Stoikov, Yehonatan Peisakhovsky</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems rely on user-provided data to learn about item quality and provide personalized recommendations. An implicit assumption when aggregating ratings into item quality is that ratings are strong indicators of item quality. In this work, we analyze this assumption using data collected from a music discovery application. Our study focuses on two factors that cause rating inflation: heterogeneous user rating behavior and the dynamics of personalized recommendations. We show that user rating behavior is significantly variable, leading to item quality estimates that reflect the users who rated an item more than the item quality itself. Additionally, items that are more likely to be shown via personalized recommendations can experience a substantial increase in their exposure and potential bias toward them. To mitigate these effects, we conducted a randomized controlled trial where the rating interface was modified. This resulted in a substantial improvement in user rating behavior and a reduction in item quality inflation. These findings highlight the importance of carefully considering the assumptions underlying recommendation systems and designing interfaces that encourage accurate rating behavior.</p>

    <h3>AutoOpt: Automatic Hyperparameter Scheduling and Optimization for Deep Click-through Rate Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yimin Huang, Bo Chen, Yujun Li, Zhenguo Li, Xing Tang, Ruiming Tang</p>
    <p>Click-through Rate (CTR) prediction is essential for commercial recommender systems. Recently, to improve the prediction accuracy, plenty of deep learning-based CTR models have been proposed, which are sensitive to hyperparameters and difficult to optimize well. General hyperparameter optimization methods fix these hyperparameters across the entire model training and repeat them multiple times. This trial-and-error process not only leads to suboptimal performance but also requires non-trivial computation efforts. In this paper, we propose an automatic hyperparameters scheduling and optimization method for deep CTR models, <i>AutoOpt</i>, making the optimization process more stable and efficient. Specifically, the whole training regime is firstly divided into several consecutive stages, where a data-efficient model is learned to model the relation between model states and prediction performance. To optimize the stage-wise hyperparameters, AutoOpt uses the <i>global</i> and <i>local</i> scheduling modules to propose proper hyperparameters for the next stage based on the training in the current stage. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks are conducted to validate the effectiveness of AutoOpt. Moreover, AutoOpt has been deployed onto an advertising platform and a music platform, where online A/B tests also demonstrate superior improvement.</p>

    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rana Abdullah, Juliane A. Lischka, Laura Laugwitz, Lucien Heitz, Hendrik Meyer, Abraham Bernstein</p>
    <p>News recommender systems are an increasingly popular field of study that attracts a growing, interdisciplinary research community. As these systems play an important role in our daily lives, the mechanisms behind their curation processes are under close scrutiny. In the domain of personalized news, many platforms make design choices that are driven by economic incentives. In contrast to such systems that optimize for financial gains, there exists norm-driven diversity objectives, putting normative and democratic goals first. Their impact on users, however, in terms of triggering behavioral changes or affecting knowledgeability, is still under-researched. In this paper, we contribute to the field of news recommender system design by conducting a user study that looks at the impact of these normative approaches. We a.) operationalize the notion of deliberative democracy for news recommendations, show b.) the impact on political knowledgeability and c.) the influence on voting behavior. We found that exposure to small parties is associated with an increase in knowledge about their candidates and that intensive news consumption about a party can change the direction of attitudes towards their issues.</p>

    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martijn C. Willemsen, Yu Liang</p>
    <p>Previous studies on exploration have shown that users can be nudged to explore further away from their current preferences. However, these effects were shown in a single session study, while it often takes time to explore new tastes and develop new preferences. In this work, we present a longitudinal study on users’ exploration behavior and behavior change over time after they have used a music genre exploration tool for four sessions in six weeks. We test two relevant nudges to help them explore more: the starting point (the personalization of the default initial playlist) and the visualization of users’ previous position(s). Our results show that the personalization level of the default initial playlist in the first session influences the preferred personalization level users set in the second session but fades away in later sessions as users start exploring in different directions. Visualization of users’ previous positions did not anchor users to stay closer to the initial defaults. Over time, users perceived the playlist to be more personalized to their tastes and helpful to explore the genre. Perceived helpfulness increased more when users explored further away from their current preferences. Apart from differences in self-reported measures, we also find some objective evidence for preference change in users’ top tracks from their Spotify profile, that over the period of 6 weeks moved somewhat closer to the genre that users selected to explore with the tool.</p>
