    <h3>NU:BRIEF – A Privacy-aware Newsletter Personalization Engine for Publishers (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reshma Narayanan Kutty, Igor Brigadir, Ernesto Diaz-Aviles, Claudia Orellana-Rodriguez</p>
    <p>Newsletters have (re-) emerged as a powerful tool for publishers to engage with their readers directly and more effectively. Despite the diversity in their audiences, publishers’ newsletters remain largely a one-size-fits-all offering, which is suboptimal. In this paper, we present NU:BRIEF, a web application for publishers that enables them to personalize their newsletters without harvesting personal data. Personalized newsletters build a habit and become a great conversion tool for publishers, providing an alternative readers-generated revenue model to a declining ad/clickbait-centered business model.<br>Demo: https://demo.nubrief.com/md03PaAJSwXMegL5BbKpQlArK3elb3hDUglcHodx4gE=/<br>Explainer video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUZGuyPJYH4</p>

    <h3>Horizontal Cross-Silo Federated Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saikishore Kalloori</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RSs) completely rely on the knowledge of training information to generate recommendations. However, due to privacy, ownership, and protection of users’ information, such training information is not easily accessible or shared with an RS. Moreover, with recent regulations in privacy laws (e.g, GDPR), collecting user preferences and perform centralized training may not be feasible. Federated Learning (FL) is a form of machine learning technique where the goal is to learn a high-quality recommendation model without never directly accessing raw training data. In this work, we specifically focus on situations where multiple stakeholders (referred to as corporate companies like e-commerce business partners, hospitals, banks, news media publishers) participate in federated learning to build a shared recommendation model. We performed offline experiments by simulating a real federated learning setup and investigated the benefits federated learning brings to stakeholders in terms of ranking compared to an RS model trained without participating in federated learning. Our experimental results reveal that stakeholders can significantly benefit from federated learning to generate accurate recommendations. Moreover, we also study the use and benefits of federated learning in situations when there are not enough preferences available for users.</p>

    <h3>Data Masking for Recommender Systems: Prediction Performance and Rating Hiding (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martha Larson, Alan Hanjalic, Manel Slokom</p>
    <p>Data science challenges allow companies, and other data holders, to collaborate with the wider research community. In the area of recommender systems, the potential of such challenges to move forward the state of the art is limited due to concerns about releasing user interaction data. This paper investigates the potential of privacy-preserving data publishing for supporting recommender system challenges. We propose a data masking algorithm, Shuffle-NNN, with two steps: Neighborhood selection and value swapping. Neighborhood selection preserves valuable item similarity information. The data shuffling technique hides (ie, changes) ratings of users for individual items. Our experimental results demonstrate that the relative performance of algorithms, which is the key property that a data science challenge must measure, is comparable between the original data and the data masked with Shuffle-NNN.</p>

    <h3>Applying Differential Privacy to Matrix Factorization (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arik Friedman, Arnaud Berlioz, Roksana Boreli, Shlomo Berkovsky, Mohamed Ali Kafaar</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are increasingly becoming an integral part of on-line services. As the recommendations rely on personal user information, there is an inherent loss of privacy resulting from the use of such systems. While several works studied privacy-enhanced neighborhood-based recommendations, little attention has been paid to privacy preserving latent factor models, like those represented by matrix factorization techniques. In this paper, we address the problem of privacy preserving matrix factorization by utilizing differential privacy, a rigorous and provable privacy preserving method. We propose and study several approaches for applying differential privacy to matrix factorization, and evaluate the privacy-accuracy trade-offs offered by each approach. We show that input perturbation yields the best recommendation accuracy, while guaranteeing a solid level of privacy protection.</p>
