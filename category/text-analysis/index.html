    <h3>Tip Ranker: A M.L. Approach to Ranking Short Reviews (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enrique Cruz, Berk Kapicioglu</p>
    <p>Foursquare is a local search and discovery app where as part of the experience users leave tips, short reviews and suggestions to help other users find great places. This poster summarizes the strategy we use to select the best tips for a given venue. Our new ranking model to select the tips that provide our users with the most informative and high quality content. The introduction of the new model yielded significant and positive results in our metrics from various applications within the Foursquare app ecosystem.</p>

    <h3>Is Readability a Valuable Signal for Hashtag Recommendations? (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Soledad Pera, Ion Madrazo</p>
    <p>We present an initial study oriented to examine the benefits of considering readability indicators in addressing social network-related tasks. In order to do so, we introduce TweetRead, a readability assessment tool specifically designed for Twitter, and use it to inform the hashtag prediction process, highlighting the importance of a readability signal in recommendation tasks.</p>

    <h3>Learning Distributed Representations from Reviews for Collaborative Filtering (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aaron Courville, Kyle Kastner, Amjad Almahairi, Kyunghyun Cho</p>
    <p>Recent work has shown that collaborative filter-based recommender systems can be improved by incorporating side information, such as natural language reviews, as a way of regularizing the derived product representations. Motivated by the success of this approach, we introduce two different models of reviews and study their effect on collaborative filtering performance. While the previous state-of-the-art approach is based on a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model of reviews, the models we explore are neural network based: a bag-of-words product-of-experts model and a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that the increased flexibility offered by the product-of-experts model allowed it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Amazon review dataset, outperforming the LDA-based approach. However, interestingly, the greater modeling power offered by the recurrent neural network appears to undermine the modelâ€™s ability to act as a regularizer of the product representations.</p>
