    <h3>Stability of Explainable Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sairamvinay Vijayaraghavan, Prasant Mohapatra</p>
    <p>Explainable Recommendation has been gaining attention over the last few years in industry and academia. Explanations provided along with recommendations for each user in a recommender system framework have many uses: particularly reasoning why a suggestion is provided and how well an item aligns with a user’s personalized preferences. Hence, explanations can play a huge role in influencing users to purchase products. However, the reliability of the explanations under varying scenarios has not been strictly verified in an empirical perspective. Unreliable explanations can bear strong consequences such as attackers leveraging explanations for manipulating and tempting users to purchase target items: that the attackers would want to promote. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of existent feature-oriented explainable recommenders, particularly analyzing their performance under different levels of external noises added into model parameters. We conducted experiments by analyzing three important state-of-the-art explainable recommenders when trained on two widely used e-commerce based recommendation datasets of different scales. We observe that all the explainable models are vulnerable to increased noise levels. Experimental results verify our hypothesis that the ability to explain recommendations does decrease along with increasing noise levels and particularly adversarial noise does contribute to a much stronger decrease. Our study presents an empirical verification on the topic of robust explanations in recommender systems which can be extended to different types of explainable recommenders in RS.</p>

    <h3>Broadening the Scope: Evaluating the Potential of Recommender Systems beyond prioritizing Accuracy (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vito Walter Anelli, Dario Di Palma, Vincenzo Paparella, Tommaso Di Noia</p>
    <p>Although beyond-accuracy metrics have gained attention in the last decade, the accuracy of recommendations is still considered the gold standard to evaluate Recommender Systems (RSs). This approach prioritizes the accuracy of recommendations, neglecting the quality of suggestions to enhance user needs, such as diversity and novelty, as well as trustworthiness regulations in RSs for user and provider fairness. As a result, single metrics determine the success of RSs, but this approach fails to consider other criteria simultaneously. A downside of this method is that the most accurate model configuration may not excel in addressing the remaining criteria. This study seeks to broaden RS evaluation by introducing a multi-objective evaluation that considers all model configurations simultaneously under several perspectives. To achieve this, several hyper-parameter configurations of an RS model are trained, and the Pareto-optimal ones are retrieved. The Quality Indicators (QI) of Pareto frontiers, which are gaining interest in Multi-Objective Optimization research, are adapted to RSs. QI enables evaluating the model’s performance by considering various configurations and giving the same importance to each metric. The experiments show that this multi-objective evaluation overturns the ranking of performance among RSs, paving the way to revisit the evaluation approaches of the RecSys research community. We release codes and datasets in the following GitHub repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RecMOE-3ED3.</p>

    <h3>Evaluating Decision-Aware Recommender Systems (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Bellogin, Rus M. Mesas</p>
    <p>The main goal of Recommender Systems is to suggest relevant items to users, although other utility dimensions — such as diversity, novelty, confidence, possibility of providing explanations — are often considered. In this work, in order to increase the amount of relevant items presented to the user, we analyse how the system could measure the confidence on its own recommendations, so it has the capability of taking decisions about whether an item should be recommended or not. A direct consequence of this design is that the number of suggested items decreases, impacting in some of the beyond-accuracy dimensions (especially, coverage). We present an evaluation of different decision-aware techniques that can be applied to any recommender system or to some families of systems, and explore evaluation metrics that allow to combine more than one evaluation dimension.</p>
