    <h3>Leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search for Group Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Andres Diaz-Pace, Antonela Tommasel</p>
    <p>Group recommenders aim to provide recommendations that satisfy the collective preferences of multiple users, a challenging task due to the diverse individual tastes and conflicting interests to be balanced. This is often accomplished by using aggregation techniques that select items on which the group can agree. Traditional aggregators struggle with these complexities, as items are chosen independently, leading to sub-optimal recommendations lacking diversity, novelty, or fairness. In this paper, we propose an aggregation technique that leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance group recommendations. MCTS is used to explore and evaluate candidate recommendation sequences to optimize overall group satisfaction. We also investigate the integration of MCTS with LLMs aiming at better understanding interactions between user preferences and recommendation sequences to inform the search. Experimental evaluations, although preliminary, showed that our proposal outperforms existing aggregation techniques in terms of relevance and beyond-accuracy aspects of recommendations. The LLM integration achieved positive results for recommendations’ relevance. Overall, this work highlights the potential of heuristic search techniques to tackle the complexities of group recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Transfer Learning in Collaborative Recommendation for Bias Reduction (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weike Pan, Dugang Liu, Zinan Lin, Zhong Ming</p>
    <p>In a recommender system, a user’s interaction is often biased by the items’ displaying positions and popularity, as well as the user’s self-selection. Most existing recommendation models are built using such a biased user-system interaction data. In this paper, we first additionally introduce a specially collected unbiased data and then propose a novel transfer learning solution, i.e., transfer via joint reconstruction (TJR), to achieve knowledge transfer and sharing between the biased data and unbiased data. Specifically, in our TJR, we refine the prediction via the latent features containing bias information in order to obtain a more accurate and unbiased prediction. Moreover, we integrate the two data by reconstructing their interaction in a joint learning manner. We then adopt three representative methods as the backbone models of our TJR and conduct extensive empirical studies on two public datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of our transfer learning solution over some very competitive baselines.</p>

    <h3>Microsoft Recommenders – Tools to Accelerate Developing Recommender Systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Scott Graham, Tao Wu, Jun Min</p>
    <p>The purpose of this demonstration is to highlight the content of the Microsoft Recommenders repository and show how it can be used to reduce the time involved in developing recommender systems. The open source repository provides python utilities to simplify common recommender-related data science work as well as example Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate use of the algorithms and tools under various environments.</p>

    <h3>Context Adaptation in Interactive Recommender Systems (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Burke, Negar Hariri, Bamshad Mobasher</p>
    <p>Contextual factors can greatly influence the utility of recommendations for users. In many recommendation and personalization applications, particularly in domains where user context changes dynamically, it is difficult to represent and model contextual factors directly, but it is often possible to observe their impact on user preferences during the course of users’ interactions with the system. In this paper, we introduce an interactive recommender system that can detect and adapt to changes in context based on the user’s ongoing behavior. The system, then, dynamically tailors its recommendations to match the user’s most recent preferences. We formulate this problem as a multi-armed bandit problem and use Thompson sampling heuristic to learn a model for the user. Following the Thompson sampling approach, the user model is updated after each interaction as the system observes the corresponding rewards for the recommendations provided during that interaction. To generate contextual recommendations, the user’s preference model is monitored for changes at each step of interaction with the user and is updated incrementally. We will introduce a mechanism for detecting significant changes in the user’s preferences and will describe how it can be used to improve the performance of the recommender system.</p>
