    <h3>Hessian-aware Quantized Node Embeddings for Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Yang, Xia Hu, Kaixiong Zhou, Yan Zheng, Chin-Chia Michael Yeh, Huiyuan Chen, Kwei-Herng Lai</p>
    <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved  state-of-the-art  performance in recommender systems. Nevertheless, the process of  searching and ranking  from a large item corpus    usually requires high latency, which limits the widespread deployment of GNNs in industry-scale applications. To address this issue, many  methods quantize user/item representations into the binary embedding space  to reduce space requirements and accelerate inference.  Also, they use the Straight-through Estimator (STE) to prevent zero gradients during back-propagation.  However, the STE often causes  gradient mismatch problem, leading to sub-optimal results. In this work, we present the Hessian-aware Quantized GNN (HQ-GNN) as an effective solution for discrete representations of users/items that enable fast retrieval. HQ-GNN is composed of two components: a GNN encoder for learning continuous node embeddings and a quantized module for compressing full-precision embeddings into low-bit ones. Consequently, HQ-GNN benefits from both lower memory requirements and faster inference speeds compared to vanilla GNNs.  To address the gradient mismatch problem in STE,  we  further consider the quantized errors and its second-order derivatives for better stability. The experimental results on several large-scale datasets show that HQ-GNN achieves a good balance between latency and performance.</p>

    <h3>Deep Bayesian Bandits: Exploring in Online Personalized Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dalin Guo, Sourav Das, Michael Kneier, Pranay Kumar Kumar Myana, Alykhan Tejani, Sofia Ira Ira Ktena, Ferenc Huszar, Wenzhe Shi</p>
    <p>Recommender systems trained in a continuous learning fashion are plagued by the feedback loop problem, also known as algorithmic bias. This causes a newly trained model to act greedily and favor items that have already been engaged by users. This behavior is particularly harmful in personalised ads recommendations, as it can also cause new campaigns to remain unexplored. Exploration aims to address this limitation by providing new information about the environment, which encompasses user preference, and can lead to higher long-term reward. In this work, we formulate a display advertising recommender as a contextual bandit and implement exploration techniques that require sampling from the posterior distribution of click-through-rates in a computationally tractable manner. Traditional large-scale deep learning models do not provide uncertainty estimates by default. We approximate these uncertainty measurements of the predictions by employing a bootstrapped model with multiple heads and dropout units. We benchmark a number of different models in an offline simulation environment using a publicly available dataset of user-ads engagements. We test our proposed deep Bayesian bandits algorithm in the offline simulation and online AB setting with large-scale production traffic, where we demonstrate a positive gain of our exploration model.</p>

    <h3>Learning Consumer and Producer Embeddings for User-Generated Content Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian McAuley, Wang-Cheng Kang</p>
    <p>User-Generated Content (UGC) is at the core of web applications where users can both produce and consume content. This differs from traditional e-Commerce domains where content producers and consumers are usually from two separate groups. In this work, we propose a method CPRec (consumer and producer based recommendation), for recommending content on UGC-based platforms. Specifically, we learn a core embedding for each user and two transformation matrices to project the user’s core embedding into two ‘role’ embeddings (i.e., a producer and consumer role). We model each interaction by the ternary relation between the consumer, the consumed item, and its producer. Empirical studies on two large-scale UGC applications show that our method outperforms standard collaborative filtering methods as well as recent methods that model producer information via item features.</p>

    <h3>Addressing Cold Start for Next-song Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Hsuan Yang, Jyh-Shing Roger Jang, Szu-Yu Chou, Yu-Ching Lin</p>
    <p>The cold start problem arises in various recommendation applications. In this paper, we propose a tensor factorization-based algorithm that exploits content features extracted from music audio to deal with the cold start problem for the emerging application next-song recommendation. Specifically, the new algorithm learns sequential behavior to predict the next song that a user would be interested in based on the last song the user just listened to. A unique characteristic of the algorithm is that it learns and updates the mapping between the audio feature space and the item latent space each time during the iterations of the factorization process. This way, the content features can be better exploited in forming the latent features for both users and items, leading to more effective solutions for cold-start recommendation. Evaluation on a large-scale music recommendation dataset shows that the recommendation result of the proposed algorithm exhibits not only higher accuracy but also better novelty and diversity, suggesting its applicability in helping a user explore new items in next-item recommendation. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/fearofchou/ALMM.</p>
