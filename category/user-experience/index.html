    <h3>How to Evaluate Serendipity in Recommender Systems: the Need for a Serendiptionnaire (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brett Binst</p>
    <p>Recommender systems can assist in various user tasks and serve diverse values, including exploring the item space. Serendipity has recently received considerable attention, often seen as a way to broaden users’ tastes and counteract filter bubbles. However, the field of research on serendipity is fragmented regarding its evaluation methods, which impedes the progress of knowledge accumulation. This research plan proposes two studies to address these issues. First, a systematic literature review will be conducted to provide insights into how serendipity is currently studied in the field. This review will serve as a reference for novice researchers and help mitigate fragmentation by presenting a thorough overview of the field. This systematic literature review has already revealed a significant gap: the lack of a validated, widely accepted method for evaluating serendipity. Therefore, the second part of this research plan is to develop a validated questionnaire, the serendiptionnaire, to measure serendipity. This tool will provide a ground truth for evaluating serendipity, aiding in answering fundamental questions within the field and validating offline metrics.</p>

    <h3>GenUI(ne) CRS: UI Elements and Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Conversational Recommender Systems with LLMs (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lien Michiels, Annelien Smets, Ulysse Maes</p>
    <p>Previous research has used Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop personalized Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) with text-based user interfaces (UIs). However, the potential of LLMs to generate interactive graphical elements that enhance user experience remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce “GenUI(ne) CRS,” a novel framework designed to leverage LLMs for adaptive and interactive UIs. Our framework supports domain-specific graphical elements such as buttons and cards, in addition to text-based inputs. It also addresses the common LLM issue of outdated knowledge, known as the “knowledge cut-off,” by implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To illustrate its potential, we developed a prototype movie CRS. This work demonstrates the feasibility of LLM-powered interactive UIs and paves the way for future CRS research, including user experience validation, transparent explanations, and addressing LLM biases.</p>

    <h3>Towards Empathetic Conversational Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingfei Liang, Yougang Lyu, Zhaochun Ren, Zhanhui Kang, Pengjie Ren, Xin Xin, Xiaoyu Zhang, Bo Zhang, Maarten de Rijke, Ruobing Xie</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) are able to elicit user preferences through multi-turn dialogues. They typically incorporate external knowledge and pre-trained language models to capture the dialogue context. Most CRS approaches, trained on benchmark datasets, assume that the standard items and responses in these benchmarks are optimal. However, they overlook that users may express negative emotions with the standard items and may not feel emotionally engaged by the standard responses. This issue leads to a tendency to replicate the logic of recommenders in the dataset instead of aligning with user needs. To remedy this misalignment, we introduce empathy within a CRS. With empathy we refer to a system’s ability to capture and express emotions. We propose an empathetic conversational recommender (ECR) framework. ECR contains two main modules: emotion-aware item recommendation and emotion-aligned response generation. Specifically, we employ user emotions to refine user preference modeling for accurate recommendations. To generate human-like emotional responses, ECR applies retrieval-augmented prompts to fine-tune a pre-trained language model aligning with emotions and mitigating hallucination. To address the challenge of insufficient supervision labels, we enlarge our empathetic data using emotion labels annotated by large language models and emotional reviews collected from external resources. We propose novel evaluation metrics to capture user satisfaction in real-world CRS scenarios. Our experiments on the ReDial dataset validate the efficacy of our framework in enhancing recommendation accuracy and improving user satisfaction.</p>

    <h3>Bridging Viewpoints in News with Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia Hua Jeng</p>
    <p>News Recommender systems (NRSs) aid in decision-making in news media. However, undesired effects can emerge. Among these are selective exposures that may contribute to polarization, potentially reinforcing existing attitudes through belief perseverance—discounting contrary evidence due to their opposing attitudinal strength. This can be unsafe for people, making it difficult to accept information objectively. A crucial issue in news recommender system research is how to mitigate these undesired effects by designing recommender interfaces and machine learning models that enable people to consider to be more open to different perspectives. Alongside accurate models, the user experience is an equally important measure. Indeed, the core statistics are based on users’ behaviors and experiences in this research project. Therefore, this research agenda aims to steer the choices of readers’ based on altering their attitudes. The core methods plan to concentrate on the interface design and ML model building involving manipulations of cues, users’ behaviors prediction, NRSs algorithm and changing the nudges. In sum, the project aims to provide insight in the extent to which news recommender systems can be effective in mitigating polarized opinions.</p>

    <h3>Accelerating Creator Audience Building through Centralized Exploration (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilherme Dinis Junior, Olayinka S. Folorunso, Gösta Forsum, Maksym Lefarov, Lucas Maystre, Antonina Danylenko, Buket Baran, Yu Zhao</p>
    <p>On Spotify, multiple recommender systems enable personalized user experiences across a wide range of product features. These systems are owned by different teams and serve different goals, but all of these systems need to explore and learn about new content as it appears on the platform. In this work, we describe ongoing efforts at Spotify to develop an efficient solution to this problem, by centralizing content exploration and providing signals to existing, decentralized recommendation systems (a.k.a. exploitation systems). We take a creator-centric perspective, and argue that this approach can dramatically reduce the time it takes for new content to reach its full potential.</p>

    <p>Query understanding models extract attributes from search queries, like color, product type, brand, etc. Search engines rely on these attributes for ranking, advertising, and recommendation, etc. However, product search queries are usually short, three or four words on average. This information shortage limits the search engine’s power to provide high-quality services.<br>In this talk, we would like to share our year-long journey in solving the information shortage problem and introduce an end-to-end system for attribute recommendation at Amazon Search. We showcase how the system works and how the system contributes to the long-term user experience through offline and online experiments at Amazon Search. We hope this talk can inspire more follow-up works in understanding and improving attribute recommendations in product search.</p>

    <h3>Flow Moods: Recommending Music by Moods on Deezer (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marin Lorant, Benjamin Chapus, Mathieu Morlon, Guillaume Salha-Galvan, Théo Bontempelli, François Rigaud</p>
    <p>The music streaming service Deezer extensively relies on its Flow algorithm, which generates personalized radio-style playlists of songs, to help users discover musical content. Nonetheless, despite promising results over the past years, Flow used to ignore the moods of users when providing recommendations. In this paper, we present Flow Moods, an improved version of Flow that addresses this limitation. Flow Moods leverages collaborative filtering, audio content analysis, and mood annotations from professional music curators to generate personalized mood-specific playlists at scale. We detail the motivations, the development, and the deployment of this system on Deezer. Since its release in 2021, Flow Moods has been recommending music by moods to millions of users every day.</p>

    <h3>Recommending for a Multi-Sided Marketplace with Heterogeneous Contents (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian Xing Zhang, Yuyan Wang, Long Tao</p>
    <p>Many online personalization platforms today are recommending heterogeneous contents in a multi-sided marketplace consisting of consumers, merchants and other partners. For a recommender system to be successful in these contexts, it faces two main challenges. First, each side in the marketplace has different and potentially conflicting utilities. Recommending for a multi-sided marketplace therefore entails jointly optimizing multiple objectives with trade-offs. Second, the off-the-shelf recommendation algorithms are not applicable to the heterogeneous content space, where a recommendation item could be an aggregation of other recommendation items. In this work, we develop a general framework for recommender systems in a multi-sided marketplace with heterogeneous and hierarchical contents. We propose a constrained optimization framework with machine learning models for each objective as inputs, and a probabilistic structural model for users’ engagement patterns on heterogeneous contents. Our proposed structural modeling approach ensures consistent user experience across different levels of aggregation of the contents, and provides levels of transparency to the merchants and content providers. We further develop an efficient optimization solution for ranking and recommendation in large-scale online systems in real time. We implement the framework at Uber Eats, one of the largest online food delivery platforms in the world and a three-sided marketplace consisting of eaters, restaurant partners and delivery partners. Online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in ranking heterogeneous contents and optimizing for the three sides in the marketplace. Our framework has been deployed globally as the recommendation algorithm for Uber Eats’ homepage.</p>

    <h3>Values of Exploration in Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohit Sharma, Ya Le, Yuyan Wang, Minmin Chen, Ed Chi, Can Xu, Lee Richardson</p>
    <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been sought after to bring next-generation recommender systems to further improve user experience on recommendation platforms. While the exploration-exploitation tradeoff is the foundation of RL research, the value of exploration in (RL-based) recommender systems is less well understood. Exploration, commonly seen as a tool to reduce model uncertainty in regions of sparse user interaction/feedback, is believed to cost user experience in the short term, while the indirect benefit of better model quality arrives at a later time. We focus on another aspect of exploration, which we refer to as user exploration to help discover new user interests, and argue it can improve user experience even in the more imminent term.<br>We examine the role of user exploration in changing different facets of recommendation quality that more directly impact user experience. To do so, we introduce a series of methods inspired by exploration research in RL to increase user exploration in an RL-based recommender system, and study their effect on the end recommendation quality, more specifically, on accuracy, diversity, novelty and serendipity. We propose a set of metrics to measure (RL based) recommender systems in these four aspects and evaluate the impact of exploration-induced methods against these metrics. In addition to the offline measurements, we conduct live experiments on an industrial recommendation platform serving billions of users to showcase the benefit of user exploration. Moreover, we use conversion of casual users to core users as an indicator of the holistic long-term user experience and study the values of user exploration in helping platforms convert users. Through offline analyses and live experiments, we study the correlation between these four facets of recommendation quality and long term user experience, and connect serendipity to improved long term user experience.</p>

    <p>In this paper, we provide insights into users’ needs regarding the inclusion of explanations in a movie recommender system. We have developed different variants of a movie recommender system prototype corresponding to different types of explanations and conducted an online user study to evaluate related explanations. The experimental results show that users do not always appreciate explanations. They want to see explanations when they are not satisfied with the recommended items. They expect to see explanations showing how well the recommended item meets their preferences. Moreover, explanation goals are interdependent and affect the overall satisfaction of users with the recommender system.</p>

    <h3>Recommendations and Results Organization in Netflix Search (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudarshan Lamkhede</p>
    <p>Personalized recommendations on the Netflix Homepage are based on a user’s viewing habits and the behavior of similar users. These recommendations, organized for efficient browsing, enable users to discover the next great video to watch and enjoy without additional input or an explicit expression of their intents or goals. The Netflix Search experience, on the other hand, allows users to take active control of discovering new videos by explicitly expressing their entertainment needs via search queries. In this talk, we discuss the importance of producing search results that go beyond traditional keyword-matches to effectively satisfy users’ search needs in the Netflix entertainment setting. Motivated by users’ various search intents, we highlight the necessity to improve Search by applying approaches that have historically powered the Homepage. Specifically, we discuss our approach to leverage recommendations in the context of Search and to effectively organize search results to provide a product experience that meaningfully adds value for our users.</p>

    <p>We developed a generic framework which enables Customer Relationship Management (CRM) organizations to deploy an automated ranking system for leads (commonly known as ‘lead scoring’). Leads are records that represent non-customers who might become customers. Lead ranking is a fundamental CRM problem with many flavors. Ranking serves as a prioritization management tool for CRM organizations, with many characteristics similar to those of recommender systems.<br>We present the system with its most recent developments, emphasizing challenges that go beyond the core of the learning algorithm, and that have played an instrumental role in maturing the system into a trustable feature, robust to different types of organizations and datasets. Particularly, we present features which enable Human in the Loop [1], a dominant concept in both configuration and result consumption. Another type of features demonstrates the addition of domain knowledge into the machine learning based process.<br>We present the concepts of feature selection, with and without human help, prediction explanations, insights on model inputs, data quality issues, training for UX consistency, and actionability for each individual prediction.</p>

    <p>After multiple years of successfully applying recommendation algorithms at ZDF, a German Public Service Media provider, we have faced certain challenges in regards to the optimization of our systems and the resulting recommendations. The design and the optimization of our systems are guided by various, partially competing objectives and are, therefore, influenced by various factors. Similarly to commercial video on demand services, ZDF is interested in binding its audience by providing personalized recommendations in its streaming media service. However, more importantly, as a Public Service Media provider, we are committed to offer diverse, universal, unbiased, and transparent recommendations while following established editorial guidelines and strict privacy regulations. Additionally, we are committed to provide environmentally-friendly or green recommendations optimizing our systems for run time and power consumption.

    <h3>Keeping Dataset Biases out of the Simulation: A Debiased Simulator for Reinforcement Learning based Recommender Systems (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Herke van Hoof, Jin Huang, Maarten de Rijke, Harrie Oosterhuis</p>
    <p>Reinforcement learning for recommendation (RL4Rec) methods are increasingly receiving attention as an effective way to improve long-term user engagement. However, applying RL4Rec online comes with risks: exploration may lead to periods of detrimental user experience. Moreover, few researchers have access to real-world recommender systems. Simulations have been put forward as a solution where user feedback is simulated based on logged historical user data, thus enabling optimization and evaluation without being run online. While simulators do not risk the user experience and are widely accessible, we identify an important limitation of existing simulation methods. They ignore the interaction biases present in logged user data, and consequently, these biases affect the resulting simulation. As a solution to this issue, we introduce a debiasing step in the simulation pipeline, which corrects for the biases present in the logged data before it is used to simulate user behavior. To evaluate the effects of bias on RL4Rec simulations, we propose a novel evaluation approach for simulators that considers the performance of policies optimized with the simulator. Our results reveal that the biases from logged data negatively impact the resulting policies, unless corrected for with our debiasing method. While our debiasing methods can be applied to any simulator, we make our complete pipeline publicly available as the Simulator for OFfline leArning and evaluation (SOFA): the first simulator that accounts for interaction biases prior to optimization and evaluation.</p>

    <h3>In-Store Augmented Reality-Enabled Product Comparison and Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jürgen Ziegler, Jesús Omar Álvarez Márquez</p>
    <p>We present an approach combining the AR-based presentation of product attributes in a physical retail store with recommendations for items only available online. The system supports users’ decision-making process by offering functions for comparing product features between items, both physical and online, and by providing recommendations based on selecting in-store products. The physical products may thus serve as anchors for forming the user’s preferences, also offering a richer and more engaging experience when exploring the products hands-on. Both objective product attributes as well as the visual appearance of a physical product are employed for generating recommendations from the online space. In this way, the advantages of online and in-store shopping can be combined, creating novel multi-channel opportunities for businesses. An empirical evaluation showed that the comparison and recommendation functions were appreciated by users, and hinted some possible benefits of a hybrid physical-online shopping support system. Despite the limitations of the study, there is sufficient evidence to consider this a viable approach worth to be further explored.</p>
