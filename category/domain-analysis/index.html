    <h3>Impact of Item Consumption on Assessment of Recommendations in User Studies (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> JÃ¼rgen Ziegler, Tim Donkers, Benedikt Loepp, Timm Kleemann</p>
    <p>In user studies of recommender systems, participants typically cannot consume the recommended items. Still, they are asked to assess recommendation quality and other aspects related to user experience by means of questionnaires. Without having listened to recommended songs or watched suggested movies, however, this might be an error-prone task, possibly limiting validity of results obtained in these studies. In this paper, we investigate the effect of actually consuming the recommended items. We present two user studies conducted in different domains showing that in some cases, differences in the assessment of recommendations and in questionnaire results occur. Apparently, it is not always possible to adequately measure user experience without allowing users to consume items. On the other hand, depending on domain and provided information, participants sometimes seem to approximate the actual value of recommendations reasonably well.</p>

    <h3>Cold-start News Recommendation with Domain-dependent Browse Graph (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Trevisiol, Rossano Schifanella, Luca Maria Aiello, Alejandro Jaimes</p>
    <p>Online social networks and mash-up services create opportunities to connect different web services otherwise isolated. Specifically in the case of news, users are very much exposed to news articles while performing other activities, such as social networking or web searching. Browsing behaviour aimed to the consumption of news, especially in relation to the visits coming from other domains, has been mainly overlooked in previous work. To address that, we build a BrowseGraph out of the collective browsing traces extracted from a large viewlog of Yahoo News (0.5B entries) and we define the ReferrerGraph as its subgraph induced by the sessions with the same referrer domain. The structural and temporal properties of the graph show that browsing behavior in news is highly dependent on the referrer URL of the session, in terms of type of content consumed and time of consumption. We build on this observation and propose a news recommender that addresses the cold-start problem: given a user landing on a page of the site for the first time, we aim to predict the page she will visit next. We compare 24 flavors of recommenders belonging to the families of content-based, popularity-based, and browsing-based models. We show that the browsing-based recommender that take into account the referrer URL is the best performing, achieving a prediction accuracy of 61% in conditions of heavy data sparsity.</p>
