    <h3>Preference Elicitation as an Optimization Problem (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filip Radlinski, Maarten de Rijke, Julia Kiseleva, Anna Sepliarskaia</p>
    <p>The new user cold-start problem arises when a recommender system does not yet have any information about a user. A common solution to this problem is to generate a user profile as part of the sign-up process, by asking the user to rate several items. We propose a new elicitation method to generate a static preference questionnaire (SPQ) that asks a new user to make pairwise comparisons between items by posing relative preference questions. Using a latent factor model, SPQ improves personalized recommendations by choosing a minimal and diverse set of static preference questions to ask any new user. We are the first to rigorously prove which optimization task should be solved in order to select the next preference question for static questionnaires. Our theoretical results are confirmed by extensive experimentation. We test the performance of SPQ on two real-world datasets, under two experimental conditions: simulated, when users behave according to LFM, and real, in which there is no user rating model. SPQ reduces the questionnaire length that is necessary to make accurate recommendations for new users by up to a factor of three compared to state-of-the-art preference elicitation methods. Moreover, solving the right optimization task, SPQ shows better performance than baselines with dynamically generated questions.</p>

    <h3>Using Graded Implicit Feedback for Bayesian Personalized Ranking (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Lukas Lerche</p>
    <p>In many application domains of recommender systems, explicit rating information is sparse or non-existent. The preferences of the current user have therefore to be approximated by interpreting his or her behavior, i.e., the implicit user feedback. In the literature, a number of algorithm proposals have been made that rely solely on such implicit feedback, among them Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR). In the BPR approach, pairwise comparisons between the items are made in the training phase and an item i is considered to be preferred over item j if the user interacted in some form with i but not with j. In real-world applications, however, implicit feedback is not necessarily limited to such binary decisions as there are, e.g., different types of user actions like item views, cart or purchase actions and there can exist several actions for an item over time. In this paper we show how BPR can be extended to deal with such more fine-granular, graded preference relations. An empirical analysis shows that this extension can help to measurably increase the predictive accuracy of BPR on realistic e-commerce datasets.</p>
