    <h3>Optimizing Podcast Discovery: Unveiling Amazon Music’s Retrieval and Ranking Framework (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Greyson, Geetha Aluri, Joaquin Delgado</p>
    <p>This work presents the search architecture of Amazon Music, which is a highly efficient system designed to retrieve relevant content for users. The architecture consists of three key stages: indexing, retrieval, and ranking. During the indexing stage, data is meticulously parsed and processed to create a comprehensive index that contains dense representations and essential information about each document (such as a music or podcast entity) in the collection, including its title, metadata, and relevant attributes. This indexing process enables fast and efficient data access during retrieval. The retrieval stage utilizes multi-faceted retrieval strategies, resulting in improved identification of candidate matches compared to traditional structured search methods. Subsequently, candidates are ranked based on their relevance to the customer’s query, taking into account document features and personalized factors. With a specific focus on the podcast use case, this paper highlights the deployment of the architecture and demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing podcast search capabilities, providing tailored and engaging content experiences.</p>

    <h3>Extended conversion: Capturing successful interactions in voice shopping (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elad Haramaty, Arnon Lazerson, Zohar Karnin, Yoelle Maarek, Liane Lewin-Eytan</p>
    <p>Being able to measure the success of online shopping interactions is crucial in order to evaluate and optimize the performance of e-commerce systems. We consider the domain of voice shopping, supported by digital voice-based assistants, where measuring successful interactions poses a challenge. Unlike Web shopping, which offers a rich amount of behavioral signals such as clicks, in voice shopping a non-negligible amount of shopping interactions frequently end without any immediate explicit or implicit user behavioral signal. Moreover, users may start their journey using voice, but finish elsewhere, for example by using their mobile app or Web. We explore the challenge of measuring successful interactions in voice product search based on users’ feedback, and propose a medium-term reward metric named Extended ConVersion (ECVR). ECVR extends the notion of conversion (purchase action), which is a clear and natural indication of success for an e-commerce system. The strength of this new metric, is that it does not only capture immediate conversion, but also a conversion that is part of the same user shopping journey, but is performed at a later stage, possibly using a different medium. We provide multiple ways of evaluating the quality of a metric, and use these to explore different parameters leading to different variants of ECVR. After finalizing these parameters, we show that a ranking system optimized for the proposed ECVR leads to an improvement in long-term engagement and revenue, without compromising immediate gains.</p>

    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enrique Cruz, Berk Kapicioglu</p>
    <p>Foursquare is a local search and discovery app where as part of the experience users leave tips, short reviews and suggestions to help other users find great places. This poster summarizes the strategy we use to select the best tips for a given venue. Our new ranking model to select the tips that provide our users with the most informative and high quality content. The introduction of the new model yielded significant and positive results in our metrics from various applications within the Foursquare app ecosystem.</p>
