    <h3>CR-SoRec: BERT driven Consistency Regularization for Social Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raksha Jalan, Naoyuki Onoe, Tushar Prakash, Brijraj Singh</p>
    <p>In the real world, when we seek our friends’ opinions on various items or events, we request verbal social recommendations. It has been observed that we often turn to our friends for recommendations on a daily basis. The emergence of online social platforms has enabled users to share their opinion with their social connections. Therefore, we should consider users’ social connections to enhance online recommendation performance. The social recommendation aims to fuse social links with user-item interactions to offer more relevant recommendations. Several efforts have been made to develop an effective social recommendation system. However, there are two significant limitations to current methods: First, they haven’t thoroughly explored the intricate relationships between the diverse influences of neighbours on users’ preferences. Second, existing models are vulnerable to overfitting due to the relatively low number of user-item interaction records in the interaction space. For the aforementioned problems,  this paper offers a novel framework called CR-SoRec, an effective recommendation model based on BERT and Consistency Regularization. This model incorporates Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer(BERT) to learn bidirectional context-aware user and item embeddings with neighbourhood sampling. The neighbourhood Sampling technique samples the most influential neighbours for all the users/ items. Further, to effectively use the available user-item interaction data and social ties, we leverage diverse perspectives via consistency regularisation to harness the underlying information. The main objective of our model is to predict the next item that a user would interact with based on its interaction behaviour and social connections. Experimental results show that our model defines a new state-of-the-art on various datasets and outperforms previous work by a significant margin. Extensive experiments are conducted to analyse the method. We release the source code of our model at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CR-SoRec-68F4</p>

    <h3>An Exploration of Sentence-Pair Classification for Algorithmic Recruiting (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toine Bogers, Mesut Kaya</p>
    <p>Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the application of computational approaches to different HR tasks, such as algorithmic hiring, skill extraction, and monitoring of employee satisfaction. Much of the recent work on estimating the fit between a person and a job has used representation learning to represent both resumes and job vacancies computationally and determine the degree to which they match. A common approach to this task is Sentence-BERT, which uses a Siamese network to encode resumes and job descriptions into fixed-length vectors and estimates how well they match based on the similarity between those vectors. In our paper, we adapt BERT’s next-sentence prediction task—predicting whether one sentence is likely to follow another in a given context—to the task of matching resumes with job descriptions. Using historical data on past (mis)matches between job-resume pairs, we fine-tune BERT for this downstream task. Through a combination of offline and online experiments on data from a large Scandinavian job portal, we show that this approach performs significantly better than Sentence-BERT and other state-of-the-art approaches for determining person-job fit.</p>

    <h3>What does BERT know about books, movies and music? Probing BERT for Conversational Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudia Hauff, Gustavo Penha</p>
    <p>Heavily pre-trained transformer models such as BERT have recently shown to be remarkably powerful at language modelling, achieving impressive results on numerous downstream tasks. It has also been shown that they implicitly store factual knowledge in their parameters after pre-training. Understanding what the pre-training procedure of LMs actually learns is a crucial step for using and improving them for Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS). We first study how much off-the-shelf pre-trained BERT “knows” about recommendation items such as books, movies and music. In order to analyze the knowledge stored in BERT’s parameters, we use different probes (i.e., tasks to examine a trained model regarding certain properties) that require different types of knowledge to solve, namely content-based and collaborative-based. Content-based knowledge is knowledge that requires the model to match the titles of items with their content information, such as textual descriptions and genres. In contrast, collaborative-based knowledge requires the model to match items with similar ones, according to community interactions such as ratings. We resort to BERT’s Masked Language Modelling (MLM) head to probe its knowledge about the genre of items, with cloze style prompts. In addition, we employ BERT’s Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) head and representations’ similarity (SIM) to compare relevant and non-relevant search and recommendation query-document inputs to explore whether BERT can, without any fine-tuning, rank relevant items first. Finally, we study how BERT performs in a conversational recommendation downstream task. To this end, we fine-tune BERT to act as a retrieval-based CRS. Overall, our experiments show that: (i) BERT has knowledge stored in its parameters about the content of books, movies and music; (ii) it has more content-based knowledge than collaborative-based knowledge; and (iii) fails on conversational recommendation when faced with adversarial data.</p>

    <h3>BERT, ELMo, USE and InferSent Sentence Encoders: The Panacea for Research-Paper Recommendation? (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Micarelli, Giuseppe Sansonetti, Joeran Beel, Fabio Gasparetti, Hebatallah A. Mohamed Hassan</p>
    <p>Content-based approaches to research paper recommendation are important when user feedback is sparse or not available. The task of content-based matching is challenging, mainly due to the problem of determining the semantic similarity of texts. Nowadays, there exist many sentence embedding models that learn deep semantic representations by being trained on huge corpora, aiming to provide transfer learning to a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. In this work, we present a comparative evaluation among five well-known pre-trained sentence encoders deployed in the pipeline of title-based research paper recommendation. The experimented encoders are USE, BERT, InferSent, ELMo, and SciBERT. For our study, we propose a methodology for evaluating such models in reranking BM25-based recommendations. The experimental results show that the sole consideration of semantic information from these encoders does not lead to improved recommendation performance over the traditional BM25 technique, while their integration enables the retrieval of a set of relevant papers that may not be retrieved by the BM25 ranking function.</p>
