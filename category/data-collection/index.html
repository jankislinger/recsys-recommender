    <h3>Delivery Hero Recommendation Dataset: A Novel Dataset for Benchmarking Recommendation Algorithms (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Klaue, Raghav Bali, Luke Bovard, Yernat Assylbekov</p>
    <p>In this paper, we propose a new dataset, Delivery Hero Recommendation Dataset (DHRD), which provides a diverse real-world dataset for researchers. DHRD comprises over a million food delivery orders from three distinct cities, encompassing thousands of vendors and an extensive range of dishes, serving a combined customer base of over a million individuals. We discuss the challenges associated with such real-world datasets. By releasing DHRD, researchers are empowered with a valuable resource for building and evaluating recommender systems, paving the way for advancements in this domain.</p>

    <h3>Transfer Learning in Collaborative Recommendation for Bias Reduction (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weike Pan, Dugang Liu, Zinan Lin, Zhong Ming</p>
    <p>In a recommender system, a user’s interaction is often biased by the items’ displaying positions and popularity, as well as the user’s self-selection. Most existing recommendation models are built using such a biased user-system interaction data. In this paper, we first additionally introduce a specially collected unbiased data and then propose a novel transfer learning solution, i.e., transfer via joint reconstruction (TJR), to achieve knowledge transfer and sharing between the biased data and unbiased data. Specifically, in our TJR, we refine the prediction via the latent features containing bias information in order to obtain a more accurate and unbiased prediction. Moreover, we integrate the two data by reconstructing their interaction in a joint learning manner. We then adopt three representative methods as the backbone models of our TJR and conduct extensive empirical studies on two public datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of our transfer learning solution over some very competitive baselines.</p>

    <h3>Deconstructing the Filter Bubble: User Decision-Making and Recommender Systems (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Duarte Goncalves, Guy Aridor, Shan Sikdar</p>
    <p>We study a model of user decision-making in the context of recommender systems via numerical simulation. Our model provides an explanation for the findings of Nguyen, et. al (2014), where, in environments where recommender systems are typically deployed, users consume increasingly similar items over time even without recommendation. We find that recommendation alleviates these natural filter-bubble effects, but that it also leads to an increase in homogeneity across users, resulting in a trade-off between homogenizing across-user consumption and diversifying within-user consumption. Finally, we discuss how our model highlights the importance of collecting data on user beliefs and their evolution over time both to design better recommendations and to further understand their impact.</p>

    <h3>Decomposing Fit Semantics for Product Size Recommendation in Metric Spaces (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian McAuley, Mengting Wan, Rishabh Misra</p>
    <p>Product size recommendation and fit prediction are critical in order to improve customers’ shopping experiences and to reduce product return rates. Modeling customers’ fit feedback is challenging due to its subtle semantics, arising from the subjective evaluation of products, and imbalanced label distribution. In this paper, we propose a new predictive framework to tackle the product fit problem, which captures the semantics behind customers’ fit feedback, and employs a metric learning technique to resolve label imbalance issues. We also contribute two public datasets collected from online clothing retailers.</p>

    <h3>Users’ Choices About Hotel Booking: Cues for Personalizing the Presentation of Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Catalin-Mihai Barbu, Jürgen Ziegler</p>
    <p>Personalization in recommender systems has typically been applied to the underlying algorithms. In contrast, the presentation of individual recommendations—specifically, the various ways in which it can be adapted to suit the user’s needs in a more effective manner—has received relatively little attention by comparison. We present the results of an exploratory survey about users’ choices regarding hotel recommendations and draw preliminary conclusions about whether these choices can influence the presentation of recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Cosibon: An e-Commerce Like Platform Enabling Bricks-and-Mortar Stores to Use Sophisticated Product Recommender Systems (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthias Raffelsieper, Thorben Keller</p>
    <p>Compared to online-retailers, bricks-and-mortar stores have only limited possibilities to understand consumer preferences, their intentions, and their feedback. The first are able to evaluate clickstream data collected on their webpages alongside the actual purchase data to put together a comprehensive view on individual customers. Bricks-and-mortar stores on the other hand have to rely solely on the evaluation of scanner data collected at the point of sale. Thus, akin to the Event Horizon in physics, describing the boundary beyond which events are unobservable, we introduce the term Receipt Horizon to describe the natural boundary beyond which a retailing company is unable to observe the behavior of individual customers. In this demo paper we present our comprehensive approach on how bricks-and-mortar stores can go beyond the Receipt Horizon. We demonstrate how existing customer loyalty programs can be leveraged by an extensive mobile app, transferring proven ecommerce concepts to physical retailers and collecting numerous novel information about consumers.</p>
