    <h3>Explore versus repeat: insights from an online supermarket (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariagiorgia Agnese Tandoi, Daniela Solis Morales</p>
    <p>At online supermarket Picnic, we implemented both traditional collaborative filtering and a hybrid method to provide recipe recommendations at scale. This case study presents findings from the online evaluation of these algorithms, focusing on the repeat-explore trade-off. Our findings allow other online retailers to gain insights into the importance of thoughtful model design in navigating this important balance. We argue that even when exploiting known preferences proves highly beneficial in the short term, prioritizing exploratory content is essential for long-term customer satisfaction and sustained growth. Our research lays the groundwork for a compelling discussion on defining success in balancing the familiar and the novel in online grocery shopping.</p>

    <h3>SeCor: Aligning Semantic and Collaborative representations by Large Language Models for Next-Point-of-Interest Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling Ding, Yang Xiang, Jianting Chen, Shirui Wang, Xiaoying Gao, Bohan Xie</p>
    <p>The widespread adoption of location-based applications has created a growing demand for point-of-interest (POI) recommendation, which aims to predict a user’s next POI based on their historical check-in data and current location. However, existing methods often struggle to capture the intricate relationships within check-in data. This is largely due to their limitations in representing temporal and spatial information and underutilizing rich semantic features. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful semantic comprehension to solve them, they are limited by hallucination and the inability to incorporate global collaborative information. To address these issues, we propose a novel method SeCor, which treats POI recommendation as a multi-modal task and integrates semantic and collaborative representations to form an efficient hybrid encoding. SeCor first employs a basic collaborative filtering model to mine interaction features. These embeddings, as one modal information, are fed into LLM to align with semantic representation, leading to efficient hybrid embeddings. To mitigate the hallucination, SeCor recommends based on the hybrid embeddings rather than directly using the LLM’s output text. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that SeCor outperforms all baselines, achieving improved recommendation performance by effectively integrating collaborative and semantic information through LLMs.</p>

    <h3>Integrating the ACT-R Framework with Collaborative Filtering for Explainable Sequential Music Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Wallmann, Markus Schedl, Elisabeth Lex, Dominik Kowald, Marta Moscati, Markus Reiter-Haas</p>
    <p>Music listening sessions often consist of sequences including repeating tracks. Modeling such relistening behavior with models of human memory has been proven effective in predicting the next track of a session. However, these models intrinsically lack the capability of recommending novel tracks that the target user has not listened to in the past. Collaborative filtering strategies, on the contrary, provide novel recommendations by leveraging past collective behaviors but are often limited in their ability to provide explanations. To narrow this gap, we propose four hybrid algorithms that integrate collaborative filtering with the cognitive architecture ACT-R. We compare their performance in terms of accuracy, novelty, diversity, and popularity bias, to baselines of different types, including pure ACT-R, kNN-based, and neural-networks-based approaches. We show that the proposed algorithms are able to achieve the best performances in terms of novelty and diversity, and simultaneously achieve a higher accuracy of recommendation with respect to pure ACT-R models. Furthermore, we illustrate how the proposed models can provide explainable recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Uncertainty-adjusted Inductive Matrix Completion with Graph Neural Networks (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Ledent, Petr Kasalicky, Rodrigo Alves</p>
    <p>We propose a robust recommender systems model which performs matrix completion and a ratings-wise uncertainty estimation jointly. Whilst the prediction module is purely based on an implicit low-rank assumption imposed via nuclear norm regularization, our loss function is augmented by an uncertainty estimation module which learns an anomaly score for each individual rating via a Graph Neural Network: data points deemed more anomalous by the GNN are downregulated in the loss function used to train the low-rank module. The whole model is trained in an end-to-end fashion, allowing the anomaly detection module to tap on the supervised information available in the form of ratings. Thus, our model’s predictors enjoy the favourable generalization properties that come with being chosen from small function space (i.e., low-rank matrices), whilst exhibiting the robustness to outliers and flexibility that comes with deep learning methods. Furthermore, the anomaly scores themselves contain valuable qualitative information. Experiments on various real-life datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms standard matrix completion and other baselines, confirming the usefulness of the anomaly detection module.</p>

    <h3>You Say Factorization Machine, I Say Neural Network – It’s All in the Activation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yedid Hoshen, Chen Almagor</p>
    <p>In recent years, many methods for machine learning on tabular data were introduced that use either factorization machines, neural networks or both. This created a great variety of methods making it non-obvious which method should be used in practice. We begin by extending the previously established theoretical connection between polynomial neural networks and factorization machines (FM) to recently introduced FM techniques. This allows us to propose a single neural-network-based framework that can switch between the deep learning and FM paradigms by a simple change of an activation function. We further show that an activation function exists which can adaptively learn to select the optimal paradigm. Another key element in our framework is its ability to learn high-dimensional embeddings by low-rank factorization. Our framework can handle numeric and categorical data as well as multiclass outputs. Extensive empirical experiments verify our analytical claims.

    <h3>Why I like it: Multi-task Learning for Recommendation and Explanation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruihai Dong, Yichao Lu, Barry Smyth</p>
    <p>We describe a novel, multi-task recommendation model, which jointly learns to perform rating prediction and recommendation explanation by combining matrix factorization, for rating prediction, and adversarial sequence to sequence learning for explanation generation. The result is evaluated using real-world datasets to demonstrate improved rating prediction performance, compared to state-of-the-art alternatives, while producing effective, personalized explanations.</p>

    <h3>When Recurrent Neural Networks meet the Neighborhood for Session-Based Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malte Ludewig, Dietmar Jannach</p>
    <p>Deep learning methods have led to substantial progress in various application fields of AI, and in recent years a number of proposals were made to improve recommender systems with artificial neural networks. For the problem of making session-based recommendations, i.e., for recommending the next item in an anonymous session, Hidasi et al. recently investigated the application of recurrent neural networks with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU4REC). Assessing the true value of such novel approaches based only on what is reported in the literature is however difficult when no standard evaluation protocols are applied and when the strength of the baselines used in the performance comparison is not clear. In this work we show based on a comprehensive empirical evaluation that a heuristics-based nearest neighbor (kNN) scheme for sessions outperforms GRU4REC in the large majority of the tested configurations and datasets. Neighborhood sampling and efficient in-memory data structures ensure the scalability of the kNN method. The best results in the end were often achieved when we combine the kNN approach with GRU4REC, which shows that RNNs can leverage sequential signals in the data that cannot be detected by the co-occurrence-based kNN method.</p>
