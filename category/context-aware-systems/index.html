    <h3>Understanding Fairness in Recommender Systems: A Healthcare Perspective (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veronica Kecki, Alan Said</p>
    <p>Fairness in AI-driven decision-making systems has become a critical concern, especially when these systems directly affect human lives. This paper explores the public’s comprehension of fairness in healthcare recommendations. We conducted a survey where participants selected from four fairness metrics – Demographic Parity, Equal Accuracy, Equalized Odds, and Positive Predictive Value – across different healthcare scenarios to assess their understanding of these concepts. Our findings reveal that fairness is a complex and often misunderstood concept, with a generally low level of public understanding regarding fairness metrics in recommender systems. This study highlights the need for enhanced information and education on algorithmic fairness to support informed decision-making in using these systems. Furthermore, the results suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach to fairness may be insufficient, pointing to the importance of context-sensitive designs in developing equitable AI systems.</p>

    <h3>EntityBot: Supporting Everyday Digital Tasks with Entity Recommendations (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salvatore Andolina, Tung Vuong, Samuel Kaski, Tuukka Ruotsalo, Mats Sjöberg, Giulio Jacucci, Khalil Klouche, Pedram Daee</p>
    <p>Everyday digital tasks can highly benefit from systems that recommend the right information to use at the right time. However, existing solutions typically support only specific applications and tasks. In this demo, we showcase EntityBot, a system that captures context across application boundaries and recommends information entities related to the current task. The user’s digital activity is continuously monitored by capturing all content on the computer screen using optical character recognition. This includes all applications and services being used and specific to individuals’ computer usages such as instant messaging, emailing, web browsing, and word processing. A linear model is then applied to detect the user’s task context to retrieve entities such as applications, documents, contact information, and several keywords determining the task. The system has been evaluated with real-world tasks, demonstrating that the recommendation had an impact on the tasks and led to high user satisfaction.</p>

    <h3>On Gossip-based Information Dissemination in Pervasive Recommender Systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Rebscher, Robin Papke, Hong Chinh Tran, Magdalena Trzeciak, Tobias Eichinger, Felix Beierle</p>
    <p>Pervasive computing systems employ distributed and embedded devices in order to raise, communicate, and process data in an anytime-anywhere fashion. Certainly, its most prominent device is the smartphone due to its wide proliferation, growing computation power, and wireless networking capabilities. In this context, we revisit the implementation of digitalized word-of-mouth that suggests exchanging item preferences between smartphones offline and directly in immediate proximity. Collaboratively and decentrally collecting data in this way has two benefits. First, it allows to attach for instance location-sensitive context information in order to enrich collected item preferences. Second, model building does not require network connectivity. Despite the benefits, the approach naturally raises data privacy and data scarcity issues. In order to address both, we propose Propagate and Filter, a method that translates the traditional approach of finding similar peers and exchanging item preferences among each other from the field of decentralized to that of pervasive recommender systems. Additionally, we present preliminary results on a prototype mobile application that implements the proposed device-to-device information exchange. Average ad-hoc connection delays of 25.9 seconds and reliable connection success rates within 6 meters underpin the approach’s technical feasibility. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>CheckInShop.eu: A Sensor-based Recommender System for micro-location Marketing (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stergios Chairistanidis, Panagiotis Symeonidis</p>
    <p>CheckInShop is an app that employs sensors to capture the user preferences  in physical stores and provide either micro-location marketing or product recommendations. By utilizing iBeacon technology and with the exploitation of a mobile app, we keep track of customer’s preferences in physical stores. Then, based on the time that a product is viewed by a customer and his micro-location inside the store, we send to him either product offers or recommendations of similar products to the ones he is looking at. These recommendations are accurate because they are provided at the right time and in the right place.</p>

    <h3>Image Discovery and Insertion for Custom Publishing (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerry Liu, Shanchan Wu, Lei Liu</p>
    <p>Images in reading materials make the content come alive. Aside from providing additional information to the text, reading material containing illustration engages our spatial memory, increases memory retention of the material. However, despite the plethora of available multimedia, adding illustrations to text continues to be a difficult task for the amateur content publisher. To address this problem, we present a semantic-aware image discovery and insertion system for custom publishing. Compared to image search engines, our system has the advantage of being able to discern among different topics within a long text passage and recommend the most relevant images for each detected topic with semantic “visual words” based relevance.</p>

    <h3>Question Recommendation with Constraints for Massive Open Online Courses (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Adamson, Diyi Yang, Carolyn Rose</p>
    <p>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have experienced a recent boom in interest. Although the number of students that have registered for MOOCs is remarkably high, the fraction of those who actively participate in course discussion forums is startlingly low. By recommending relevant forum discussions and questions to students, their engagement and participation may increase, to the benefit of both the student and the course community. This problem has not been thoroughly explored by existing recommender systems. In contrast to traditional product recommendation, question recommendation in discussion forums should consider constraints on both students and questions. These considerations include (1)Load Balancing – students should not be over-burdened with too many requests; and (2) Expertise Matching – matching students’ abilities to the difficulty of unanswered questions, which in turn positions students to contribute meaningfully to the forum. In this work, we propose a novel constrained question recommendation problem to address the above considerations, with the intent to improve the learning experience for course participants. We first design a context-aware matrix factorization model to predict students’ preferences over questions, then build a max cost flow model to address the constraints. Experimental results on three MOOC datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods in optimizing overall forum welfare, and in predicting which questions students might be interested in.</p>
