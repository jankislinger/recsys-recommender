    <h3>Improving the Shortest Plank: Vulnerability-Aware Adversarial Training for Robust Recommender System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fei Sun, Qi Cao, Yunfan Wu, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng, Kaike Zhang</p>
    <p>Recommender systems play a pivotal role in mitigating information overload in diverse fields. Nonetheless, the inherent openness of these systems introduces vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to insert fake users to skew the exposure of certain items, known as poisoning attacks. Adversarial training emerges as a notable defense mechanism against such poisoning attacks within recommender systems. Traditional adversarial training methods apply perturbations with the same scale across all users to their embeddings to maintain system robustness against the worst-case attacks. Yet, in reality, attacks often affect only a subset of users who are actually vulnerable to the specific attacks. These indiscriminate perturbations make it difficult to balance effective protection for vulnerable users and avoidance of recommendation quality degradation for those who are not. To address this issue, our research delves into understanding user vulnerability. Considering that poisoning attacks pollutes the training data, we observe that the extent of a recommender system’s fit to users’ training data, particularly when high, correlates with an increased likelihood of users incorporating attack information, thus indicating their vulnerability. Leveraging these insights, we introduce the Vulnerability-aware Adversarial Training (VAT) method, designed to counteract poisoning attacks in recommender systems. VAT employs a novel vulnerability-aware function to estimate users’ vulnerability based on the degree to which they are fitted by the system. Guided by this evaluation, VAT applies user-specific perturbations to embeddings. thereby not only reducing the success rate of attacks but also preserving—and potentially enhancing—the quality of recommendations. Comprehensive experiments confirm VAT’s superior defensive capabilities against various attacks and recommendation models.</p>

    <h3>Improving Adversarial Robustness for Recommendation Model via Cross-Domain Distributional Adversarial Training (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Yang, Lilin Zhang, Jingyu Chen</p>
    <p>Recommendation models based on deep learning are fragile when facing adversarial examples (AE). Adversarial training (AT) is the existing mainstream method to promote the adversarial robustness of recommendation models. However, these AT methods often have two drawbacks. First, they may be ineffective due to the ubiquitous sparsity of interaction data. Second, point-wise perturbation used by these AT methods leads to suboptimal adversarial robustness, because not all examples are equally susceptible to such perturbations. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel method called Cross-domain Distributional Adversarial Training (CDAT) which utilizes a richer auxiliary domain to improve the adversarial robustness of a sparse target domain. CDAT comprises a Domain adversarial network (Dan) and a Cross-domain adversarial example generative network (Cdan). Dan learns a domain-invariant preference distribution which is obtained by aligning user embeddings from two domains and paves the way to leverage the knowledge from another domain for the target domain. Then, by adversarially perturbing the domain-invariant preference distribution under the guidance of a discriminator, Cdan captures an aggressive and imperceptible AE distribution. In this way, CDAT can transfer distributional adversarial robustness from the auxiliary domain to the target domain. The extensive experiments conducted on real datasets demonstrate the remarkable superiority of the proposed CDAT in improving the adversarial robustness of the sparse domain.</p>

    <h3>Accelerating the Surrogate Retraining for Poisoning Attacks against Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunfan Wu, Shuchang Tao, Qi Cao, Huawei Shen, Fei Sun, Kaike Zhang</p>
    <p>Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of recommender systems to data poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject carefully crafted fake user interactions into the training data to manipulate recommendations for target items.Current attack methods involve iterative retraining a surrogate recommender on the poisoned data with latest fake users to optimize the attack. However, this repetitive retraining is highly time-consuming, hindering the efficient assessment and optimization of fake users. To mitigate this computational bottleneck and develop a more effective attack in an affordable time, we analyze the retraining process and find that a change in the representation of one user/item will cause a cascading effect through the user-item interaction graph. Under theoretical guidance, we introduce Gradient Passing (GP),  a novel technique that explicitly passes gradients between interacted user-item pairs during backpropagation, thereby approximate the cascading effect and accelerating retraining. With just a single training step, GP can achieve effects comparable to multiple original steps. Under the same number of retraining epochs, GP enables a closer approximation of the surrogate recommender to the victim. This improved approximation provides better guidance for optimizing fake users, ultimately leading to enhanced data poisoning attacks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed GP.</p>

    <h3>Adversarial Sleeping Bandit Problems with Multiple Plays: Algorithm and Ranking Application (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Lee Woon, Ludovik Coba, Jianjun Yuan</p>
    <p>This paper presents an efficient algorithm to solve the sleeping bandit with multiple plays problem in the context of an online recommendation system. The problem involves bounded, adversarial loss and unknown i.i.d. distributions for arm availability. The proposed algorithm extends the sleeping bandit algorithm for single arm selection and is guaranteed to achieve theoretical performance with regret upper bounded by $\bigO(kN^2\sqrt{T\log T})$, where $k$ is the number of arms selected per time step, $N$ is the total number of arms, and $T$ is the time horizon.</p>
