    <h3>Oh, Behave! Country Representation Dynamics Created by Feedback Loops in Music Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Kowald, Markus Schedl, Oleg Lesota, Jonas Geiger, Max Walder</p>
    <p>Recent work suggests that music recommender systems are prone to disproportionally frequent recommendations of music from countries more prominently represented in the training data, notably the US. However, it remains unclear to what extent feedback loops in music recommendation influence the dynamics of such imbalance. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of representation of local (i.e., country-specific) and US-produced music in user profiles and recommendations. To this end, we conduct a feedback loop simulation study using the standardized LFM-2b dataset. The results suggest that most of the investigated recommendation models decrease the proportion of music from local artists in their recommendations. Furthermore, we find that models preserving average proportions of US and local music do not necessarily provide country-calibrated recommendations. We also look into popularity calibration and, surprisingly, find that the most popularity-calibrated model in our study (ItemKNN) provides the least country-calibrated recommendations. In addition, users from less represented countries (e.g., Finland) are, in the long term, most affected by the under-representation of their local music in recommendations.</p>

    <h3>It’s Not You, It’s Me: The Impact of Choice Models and Ranking Strategies on Gender Imbalance in Music Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Ekstrand, Andres Ferraro, Christine Bauer</p>
    <p>As recommender systems are prone to various biases, mitigation approaches are needed to ensure that recommendations are fair to various stakeholders. One particular concern in music recommendation is artist gender fairness. Recent work has shown that the gender imbalance in the sector translates to the output of music recommender systems, creating a feedback loop that can reinforce gender biases over time. In this work, we examine whether algorithmic strategies or user behavior are a greater contributor to ongoing improvement (or loss) in fairness as models are repeatedly re-trained on new user feedback data. We simulate this repeated process to investigate the effects of ranking strategies and user choice models on gender fairness metrics. We find re-ranking strategies have a greater effect than user choice models on recommendation fairness over time</p>

    <h3>Navigating the Feedback Loop in Recommender Systems: Insights and Strategies from Industry Practice (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ding Tong, Justin Basilico, James McInerney, Ting-Po Lee, Qifeng Qiao</p>
    <p>Understanding and measuring the impact of feedback loops in industrial recommender systems is challenging, leading to the underestimation of the deterioration. In this study, we define open and closed feedback loops and investigate the unique reasons behind the emergence of feedback loops in the industry, drawing from real-world examples that have received limited attention in prior research. We highlight the measurement challenges associated with capturing the full impact of feedback loops using traditional online A/B tests. To address this, we propose the use of offline evaluation frameworks as surrogates for long-term feedback loop bias, supported by a practical simulation system using real data. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the performance of recommender systems operating under feedback loop conditions.</p>

    <h3>How Algorithmic Confounding in Recommendation Systems Increases Homogeneity and Decreases Utility (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Allison Chaney, Brandon Stewart, Barbara Engelhardt</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems are ubiquitous and impact many domains; they have the potential to influence product consumption, individuals’ perceptions of the world, and life-altering decisions. These systems are often part of a feedback loop: models are evaluated or trained with observed data that are confounded because users are already exposed to algorithmic recommendations. In this paper, we use simulations to show that using confounded data may amplify homogenization of user behavior without increasing utility.</p>
