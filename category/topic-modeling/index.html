    <h3>Adaptive Collaborative Topic Modeling for Online Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre-Alexandre Murena, Marie Al-Ghossein, Talel Abdessalem, Anthony Barré, Antoine Cornuéjols</p>
    <p>Collaborative filtering (CF) mainly suffers from rating sparsity and from the cold-start problem. Auxiliary information like texts and images has been leveraged to alleviate these problems, resulting in hybrid recommender systems (RS). Due to the abundance of data continuously generated in real-world applications, it has become essential to design online RS that are able to handle user feedback and the availability of new items in real-time. These systems are also required to adapt to drifts when a change in the data distribution is detected. In this paper, we propose an adaptive collaborative topic modeling approach, CoAWILDA, as a hybrid system relying on adaptive online Latent Dirichlet Allocation (AWILDA) to model new available items arriving as a document stream and incremental matrix factorization for CF. The topic model is maintained up-to-date in an online fashion and is retrained in batch when a drift is detected, using documents automatically selected by an adaptive windowing technique. Our experiments on real-world datasets prove the effectiveness of our approach for online recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Using Citation-Context to Reduce Topic Drifting on Pure Citation-Based Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anita Khadka, Petr Knoth</p>
    <p>Recent works in the area of academic recommender systems have demonstrated the effectiveness of co-citation and citation closeness in related-document recommendations. However, documents recommended from such systems may drift away from the main concept of the query document. In this work, we investigate whether incorporating the textual information in close proximity to a citation as well as the citation position could reduce such drifting and further increase the performance of the recommender system. To investigate this, we run experiments with several recommendation methods on a newly created and now publicly available dataset containing 53 million unique citation based records. We then conduct a user-based evaluation with domain-knowledgeable participants. Our results show that a new method based on the combination of Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA), topic modelling and word embeddings achieve more than 20% improvement in Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) compared to CPA.</p>

    <h3>Topical Semantic Recommendations for Auteur Films (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Till Plumbaum, Andreas Lommatzsch, Christian Rakow</p>
    <p>With the ubiquity of fast internet connections and the growing availability of Video-On-Demand (VOD) services powerful recommender systems are needed. Traditionally, movie recommender systems apply user-based collaborative filtering providing high quality recommendations if users maintain user profiles describing preferences and movie ratings. The shortcomings of Collaborative Filtering are that comprehensive user profiles are required and users tend to get recommendations very similar to the user profile (filter bubble). In addition, CF-based recommenders neither consider current trends nor the context. In order to overcome these weaknesses, we develop a system identifying interesting events in the stream of current news and deploying this information for computing recommendations. Our system gathers topics of interest from Twitter and RSS-Feeds, extracts relevant Named Entities, and uses semantic relations for recommending movies closely related to these topics. We explain the used algorithms and show that our system provides highly relevant recommendations.</p>

    <h3>A Recommender System to Tackle Enterprise Collaboration (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilmar Alves de Souza, Gabriel de Souza Pereira Moreira</p>
    <p>Collaboration platforms have been available for many years, but they struggle to overcome what is known as the collaboration paradox: people want all the benefits provided by such tools, but they won’t invest their times without some sort of immediate gain. To tackle this problem, we developed an enterprise collaboration platform named Smart Canvas. Smart Canvas is a service that allows people to bring, create and curate content relevant to their organizations. The product’s main goal is to leverage companies knowledge and tear down silos by connecting people, teams, and content. One of the main components of the product is a scalable cloud-based Recommender System, built using techniques like Topic Modeling, Content-Based Recommenders and Graph Analysis. In this demo, Smart Canvas will be presented in web and mobile interfaces, with data from a real customer. We are also going to describe details of the models, algorithms and architecture (which includes tools like Apache Spark and Titan Graph Database deployed on Google Cloud Platform).</p>

    <h3>Content Driven User Profiling for Comment-Worthy Recommendations of News and Blog Articles (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mrinal Das, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Trapit Bansal</p>
    <p>We consider the problem of recommending articles such as news and blog-posts. An article is defined to be comment-worthy for a particular user if that user is interested to leave a comment on it. We note that recommending comment-worthy articles calls for elicitation of of the user from the of both the articles and the past comments made by users. We thus propose to develop user profiles to elicit these latent interests of users in commenting and use them to recommend articles for future commenting. The difficulty of modeling comment content and the varied nature of users’ commenting interests make the problem technically challenging. The problem of recommending comment-worthy articles is resolved by leveraging article and comment content through topic modeling and the co-commenting pattern of users through collaborative filtering, combined within a novel hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach. Our solution, Collaborative Correspondence Topic Models (CCTM), generates user profiles which are leveraged to provide a personalized ranking of articles for each user. Through these -driven user profiles, CCTM effectively handle the ubiquitous problem of without relying on additional meta-data. The inference problem for the model is intractable with no off-the-shelf solution and we develop an efficient Monte Carlo EM algorithm. CCTM is evaluated on three real world data-sets, crawled from two , ArsTechnica (AT) Gadgets (102,087 comments) and AT-Science (71,640 comments), and a site, DailyMail (33,500 comments). We show average improvement of 14% (warm-start) and 18% (cold-start) in AUC, and 80% (warm-start) and 250% (cold-start) in Hit-Rank@5, over state of the art.</p>

    <h3>Ratings Meet Reviews, a Combined Approach to Recommend (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guang Ling, Irwin King, Michael Lyu</p>
    <p>Most existing recommender systems focus on modeling the ratings while ignoring the abundant information embedded in the review text. In this paper, we propose a unified model that combines content-based filtering with collaborative filtering, harnessing the information of both ratings and reviews. We apply topic modeling techniques on the review text and align the topics with rating dimensions to improve prediction accuracy. With the information embedded in the review text, we can alleviate the cold-start problem. Furthermore, our model is able to learn latent topics that are interpretable. With these interpretable topics, we can explore the prior knowledge on items or users and recommend completely “cold” items. Empirical study on 27 classes of real-life datasets show that our proposed model lead to significant improvement compared with strong baseline methods, especially for datasets which are extremely sparse where rating-only methods cannot make accurate predictions.</p>
