    <h3>It’s Not You, It’s Me: The Impact of Choice Models and Ranking Strategies on Gender Imbalance in Music Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Ekstrand, Andres Ferraro, Christine Bauer</p>
    <p>As recommender systems are prone to various biases, mitigation approaches are needed to ensure that recommendations are fair to various stakeholders. One particular concern in music recommendation is artist gender fairness. Recent work has shown that the gender imbalance in the sector translates to the output of music recommender systems, creating a feedback loop that can reinforce gender biases over time. In this work, we examine whether algorithmic strategies or user behavior are a greater contributor to ongoing improvement (or loss) in fairness as models are repeatedly re-trained on new user feedback data. We simulate this repeated process to investigate the effects of ranking strategies and user choice models on gender fairness metrics. We find re-ranking strategies have a greater effect than user choice models on recommendation fairness over time</p>

    <h3>Fair Ranking Metrics (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amifa Raj</p>
    <p>Information access systems such as search engines and recommender systems often display results in a sorted ranked list based on their relevance. Fairness of these ranked list has received attention as an important evaluation criteria along with traditional metrics such as utility or accuracy. Fairness broadly involves both provider and consumer side fairness at both group and individual levels. Several fair ranking metrics have been proposed to measure group fairness for providers based on various “sensitive attributes”. These metrics differ in their fairness goal, assumptions, and implementations. Although there are several fair ranking metrics to measure group fairness, multiple open challenges still exist in this area to consider.<br>In my thesis, I work on the area of fair ranking metrics for provider-side group fairness. I am interested in understanding the fairness concepts and practical applications of these metrics to identify their strength and limitations to aid the researchers and practitioner by pointing out the gaps. Moreover, I will contribute to this research area by focusing on some of the limitations like considering different browsing models and bias in relevance information.</p>
