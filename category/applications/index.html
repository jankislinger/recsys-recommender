    <h3>Exploring False Hard Negative Sample in Cross-Domain Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haokai Ma, Xu Zhang, Lei Meng, Xin Chen, Jie Zhou, Leyu Lin, Ruobing Xie</p>
    <p>Negative Sampling in recommendation aims to capture informative negative instances for the sparse user-item interactions to improve the performance. Conventional negative sampling methods tend to select informative hard negative samples (HNS) besides the default random samples. However, these hard negative sampling methods usually struggle with false hard negative samples (FHNS), which happens when a user-item interaction has not been observed yet and is picked as a negative sample, while the user will actually interact with this item once exposed to it. Such FHNS issues may seriously confuse the model training, while most conventional hard negative sampling methods do not systematically explore and distinguish FHNS from HNS. To address this issue, we propose a novel model-agnostic Real Hard Negative Sampling (RealHNS) framework specially for cross-domain recommendation (CDR), which aims to discover the false and refine the real from all HNS via both general and cross-domain real hard negative sample selectors. For the general part, we conduct the coarse-grained and fine-grained real HNS selectors sequentially, armed with a dynamic item-based FHNS filter to find high-quality HNS. For the cross-domain part, we further design a new cross-domain HNS for alleviating negative transfer in CDR and discover its corresponding FHNS via a dynamic user-based FHNS filter to keep its power. We conduct experiments on four datasets based on three representative model-agnostic hard negative sampling methods, along with extensive model analyses, ablation studies, and universality analyses. The consistent improvements indicate the effectiveness, robustness, and universality of RealHNS, which is also easy-to-deploy in real-world systems as a plug-and-play strategy. The source code will be released in the future.</p>

    <h3>Exploring Unlearning Methods to Ensure the Privacy, Security, and Usability of Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jens Leysen</p>
    <p>Machine learning algorithms have proven highly effective in analyzing large amounts of data and identifying complex patterns and relationships. One application of machine learning that has received significant attention in recent years is recommender systems, which are algorithms that analyze user behavior and other data to suggest items or content that a user may be interested in. However useful, these systems may unintentionally retain sensitive, outdated, or faulty information. Posing a risk to user privacy, system security, and limiting a system’s usability. In this research proposal, we aim to address these challenges by investigating methods for machine “unlearning”, which would allow information to be efficiently “forgotten” or “unlearned” from machine learning models. The main objective of this proposal is to develop the foundation for future machine unlearning methods. We first evaluate current unlearning methods and explore novel adversarial attacks on these methods’ verifiability, efficiency, and accuracy to gain new insights and further develop the theory of machine unlearning. Using our gathered insights, we seek to create novel unlearning methods that are verifiable, efficient, and limit unnecessary accuracy degradation. Through this research, we seek to make significant contributions to the theoretical foundations of machine unlearning while also developing unlearning methods that can be applied to real-world problems.</p>

    <h3>LinkedIn Skills: Large-Scale Topic Extraction and Inference (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Lloyd, Matthew Hayes, Mathieu Bastian, Sam Shah, William Vaughan, Peter Skomoroch, Hyungjin Kim, Sal Uryasev</p>
    <p>“Skills and Expertise” is a data-driven feature on LinkedIn, the world’s largest professional online social network, which allows members to tag themselves with topics representing their areas of expertise. In this work, we present our experiences developing this large-scale topic extraction pipeline, which includes constructing a folksonomy of skills and expertise and implementing an inference and recommender system for skills. We also discuss a consequent set of applications, such as Endorsements, which allows members to tag themselves with topics representing their areas of expertise and for their connections to provide social proof, via an “endorse” action, of that member’s competence in that topic.</p>
