    <h3>On the Consistency of Average Embeddings for Item Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Romain Hennequin, Thomas Bouabça, Guillaume Salha-Galvan, Walid Bendada, Tristan Cazenave</p>
    <p>A prevalent practice in recommender systems consists of averaging item embeddings to represent users or higher-level concepts in the same embedding space. This paper investigates the relevance of such a practice. For this purpose, we propose an expected precision score, designed to measure the consistency of an average embedding relative to the items used for its construction. We subsequently analyze the mathematical expression of this score in a theoretical setting with specific assumptions, as well as its empirical behavior on real-world data from music streaming services. Our results emphasize that real-world averages are less consistent for recommendation, which paves the way for future research to better align real-world embeddings with assumptions from our theoretical setting.</p>

    <h3>Domain Disentanglement with Interpolative Data Augmentation for Dual-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Zhu, Zhu Sun, Yan Wang, Jiajie Zhu</p>
    <p>The conventional single-target Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) aims to improve the recommendation performance on a sparser target domain by transferring the knowledge from a source domain that contains relatively richer information. By contrast, in recent years, dual-target CDR has been proposed to improve the recommendation performance on both domains simultaneously. However, to this end, there are two challenges in dual-target CDR: (1) how to generate both relevant and diverse augmented user representations, and (2) how to effectively decouple domain-independent information from domain-specific information, in addition to domain-shared information, to capture comprehensive user preferences. To address the above two challenges, we propose a Disentanglement-based framework with Interpolative Data Augmentation for dual-target Cross-Domain Recommendation, called DIDA-CDR. In DIDA-CDR, we first propose an interpolative data augmentation approach to generating both relevant and diverse augmented user representations to augment sparser domain and explore potential user preferences. We then propose a disentanglement module to effectively decouple domain-specific and domain-independent information to capture comprehensive user preferences. Both steps significantly contribute to capturing more comprehensive user preferences, thereby improving the recommendation performance on each domain. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets show the significant superiority of DIDA-CDR over the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>M3REC: A Meta-based Multi-scenario Multi-task Recommendation Framework (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zerong Lan, Yingyi Zhang, Xianneng Li</p>
    <p>Users in recommender systems exhibit multi-behavior in multiple business scenarios on real-world e-commerce platforms. A crucial challenge in such systems is to make recommendations for each business scenario at the same time. On top of this, multiple predictions (e.g., Click Through Rate and Conversion Rate) need to be made simultaneously in order to improve the platform revenue. Research focus on making recommendations for several business scenarios is in the field of Multi-Scenario Recommendation (MSR), and Multi-Task Recommendation (MTR) mainly attempts to solve the possible problems in collaboratively executing different recommendation tasks. However, existing researchers have paid attention to either MSR or MTR, ignoring the integration of MSR and MTR that faces the issue of conflict between scenarios and tasks. To address the above issue, we propose a Meta-based Multi-scenario Multi-task RECommendation framework (M3REC) to serve multiple tasks in multiple business scenarios by a unified model. However, integrating MSR and MTR in a proper manner is non-trivial due to: 1) Unified representation problem: Users’ and items’ representation behave Non-i.i.d in different scenarios and tasks which takes inconsistency into recommendations. 2) Synchronous optimization problem: Tasks distribution varies in different scenarios, and a unified optimization method is needed to optimize multi-tasks in multi-scenarios. Thus, to unified represent users and items, we design a Meta-Item-Embedding Generator (MIEG) and a User-Preference Transformer (UPT). The MIEG module can generate initialized item embedding using item features through meta-learning technology, and the UPT module can transfer user preferences in other scenarios. Besides, the M3REC framework uses a specifically designed backbone network together with a task-specific aggregate gate to promote all tasks to achieve the purpose of optimizing multiple tasks in multiple business scenarios within one model. Experiments on two public datasets have shown that M3REC outperforms those compared MSR and MTR state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>Task-Based User Modelling for Personalization via Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Mehrotra, Emine Yilmaz, Manisha Verma</p>
    <p>We introduce a novel approach to user modelling for behavioral targeting: task-based user representation and present an approach based on search task extraction from search logs wherein users are represented by their actions over a task-space. Given a web search log, we extract search tasks performed by users and nd user representations based on these tasks. More specically, we construct a user-task association matrix and borrow insights from Collaborative Filtering to learn low-dimensional factor model wherein the interests/preferences of a user are determined by a small number of latent factors. We compare the performance of the proposed approach on the task of collaborative query recommendation on publicly available AOL search log with a standard term-similarity baseline and discuss potential future research directions.</p>
