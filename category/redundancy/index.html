    <h3>Data Quality Matters in Recommender Systems (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shlomo Berkovsky, Royi Ronen, Amir Amihood, Oren Sar Shalom, Elad Ziklik</p>
    <p>Although data quality has been recognized as an important factor in the broad information systems research, it has received little attention in recommender systems. Data quality matters are typically addressed in recommenders by ad-hoc cleansing methods, which prune noisy or unreliable records from the data. However, the setting of the cleansing parameters is often done arbitrarily, without thorough consideration of the data characteristics. In this work, we turn to two central data quality problems in recommender systems: sparsity and redundancy. We devise models for setting data-dependent thresholds and sampling levels, and evaluate these using a collection of public and proprietary datasets. We observe that the models accurately predict data cleansing parameters, while having minor effect on the accuracy of the generated recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Coverage, Redundancy and Size-Awareness in Genre Diversity for Recommender Systems (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saul Vargas, Pablo Castells, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Linas Baltrunas</p>
    <p>There is increasing awareness in the Recommender Systems field that diversity is as a key property that enhances the usefulness of recommendations. Genre information can serve as a means to measure and enhance the diversity of recommendations and is readily available in domains such as movies, music or books. In this work we propose a new Binomial framework for defining genre diversity in recommender systems that takes into account three key properties: genre coverage, genre redundancy and recommendation list size-awareness. We show that methods previously proposed for measuring and enhancing recommendation diversity -including those adapted from search result diversification- fail to address adequately these three properties. We also propose an efficient greedy optimization technique to optimize Binomial diversity. Experiments with the Netflix dataset show the properties of our framework and comparison with state of the art methods.</p>
