    <h3>Large-Scale Modeling of Mobile User Click Behaviors Using Deep Learning (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Li, Xin Zhou</p>
    <p>Modeling tap or click sequences of users on a mobile device can improve our understandings of interaction behavior and offers opportunities for UI optimization by recommending next element the user might want to click on. We analyzed a large-scale dataset of over 20 million clicks from more than 4,000 mobile users who opted in. We then designed a deep learning model that predicts the next element that the user clicks given the user’s click history, the structural information of the UI screen, and the current context such as the time of the day. We thoroughly investigated the deep model by comparing it with a set of baseline methods based on the dataset. The experiments show that our model achieves 48% and 71% accuracy (top-1 and top-3) for predicting next clicks based on a held-out dataset of test users, which significantly outperformed all the baseline methods with a large margin. We discussed a few scenarios for integrating the model in mobile interaction and how users can potentially benefit from the model.</p>

    <h3>Contextual User Browsing Bandits for Large-Scale Online Mobile Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xu He, Haikai Chen, Bo An, Qingyu Guo, Yanghua Li, Zhirong Wang, Xin Li</p>
    <p>Online recommendation services recommend multiple commodities to users. Nowadays, a considerable proportion of users visit e-commerce platforms by mobile devices. Due to the limited screen size of mobile devices, positions of items have a significant influence on clicks: 1) Higher positions lead to more clicks for one commodity. 2) The ‘pseudo-exposure’ issue: Only a few recommended items are shown at first glance and users need to slide the screen to browse other items. Therefore, some recommended items ranked behind are not viewed by users and it is not proper to treat this kind of items as negative samples. While many works model the online recommendation as contextual bandit problems, they rarely take the influence of positions into consideration and thus the estimation of the reward function may be biased. In this paper, we aim at addressing these two issues to improve the performance of online mobile recommendation. Our contributions are four-fold. First, since we concern the reward of a set of recommended items, we model the online recommendation as a contextual combinatorial bandit problem and define the reward of a recommended set. Second, we propose a novel contextual combinatorial bandit method called UBM-LinUCB to address two issues related to positions by adopting the User Browsing Model (UBM), a click model for web search. Third, we provide a formal regret analysis and prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret independent of the number of items. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on two real-world datasets by a novel unbiased estimator. An online experiment is also implemented in Taobao, one of the most popular e-commerce platforms in the world. Results on two CTR metrics show that our algorithm outperforms the other contextual bandit algorithms.</p>
