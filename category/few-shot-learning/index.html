    <h3>TLRec: A Transfer Learning Framework to Enhance Large Language Models for Sequential Recommendation Tasks (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuang Peng, Jiaye Lin, Zhong Zhang, Peilin Zhao</p>
    <p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in recommendation systems, improving recommendation performance through in-context learning or parameter-efficient fine-tuning. However, cross-domain generalization, i.e., model training in one scenario (source domain) but inference in another (target domain), is underexplored. In this paper, we present TLRec, a transfer learning framework aimed at enhancing LLMs for sequential recommendation tasks. TLRec specifically focuses on text inputs to mitigate the challenge of limited transferability across diverse domains, offering promising advantages over traditional recommendation models that heavily depend on unique identities (IDs) like user IDs and item IDs. Moreover, we leverage the source domain data to further enhance LLMs’ performance in the target domain. Initially, we employ powerful closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) and chain-of-thought techniques to construct instruction tuning data from the third-party scenario (source domain). Subsequently, we apply curriculum learning to fine-tune LLMs for effective knowledge injection and perform recommendations in the target domain. Experimental results demonstrate that TLRec achieves superior performance under the zero-shot and few-shot settings.</p>

    <h3>Large Language Models are Competitive Near Cold-start Recommenders for Language- and Item-based Preferences (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Dixon, Krisztian Balog, Filip Radlinski, Scott Sanner, Ben Wedin</p>
    <p>Traditional recommender systems leverage users’ item preference history to recommend novel content that users may like.  However, dialog interfaces that allow users to express language-based preferences offer a fundamentally different modality for preference input.  Inspired by recent successes of prompting paradigms for large language models (LLMs), we study their use for making recommendations from both item-based and language-based preferences in comparison to state-of-the-art item-based collaborative filtering (CF) methods.  To support this investigation, we collect a new dataset consisting of both item-based and language-based preferences elicited from users along with their ratings on a variety of (biased) recommended items and (unbiased) random items.  Among numerous experimental results, we find that LLMs provide competitive recommendation performance for pure language-based preferences (no item preferences) in the near cold-start case in comparison to item-based CF methods, despite having no supervised training for this specific task (zero-shot) or only a few labels (few-shot).  This is particularly promising as language-based preference representations are more explainable and scrutable than item-based or vector-based representations.</p>

    <h3>Next-item Recommendations in Short Sessions (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Wang, Shengsheng Wang, Wenzhuo Song, Shoujin Wang</p>
    <p>The changing preferences of users towards items trigger the emergence of session-based recommender systems (SBRSs), which aim to model the dynamic preferences of users for next-item recommendations. However, most of the existing studies on SBRSs are based on long sessions only for recommendations, ignoring short sessions, though short sessions, in fact, account for a large proportion in most of the real-world datasets. As a result, the applicability of existing SBRSs solutions is greatly reduced. In a short session, quite limited contextual information is available, making the next-item recommendation very challenging. To this end, in this paper, inspired by the success of few-shot learning (FSL) in effectively learning a model with limited instances, we formulate the next-item recommendation as an FSL problem. Accordingly, following the basic idea of a representative approach for FSL, i.e., meta-learning, we devise an effective SBRS called INter-SEssion collaborativeRecommender neTwork (INSERT) for next-item recommendations in short sessions. With the carefully devised local module and global module, INSERT is able to learn an optimal preference representation of the current user in a given short session. In particular, in the global module, a similar session retrieval network (SSRN) is designed to find out the sessions similar to the current short session from the historical sessions of both the current user and other users, respectively. The obtained similar sessions are then utilized to complement and optimize the preference representation learned from the current short session by the local module for more accurate next-item recommendations in this short session. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed INSERT over the state-of-the-art SBRSs when making next-item recommendations in short sessions.</p>

    <h3>ProtoCF: Prototypical Collaborative Filtering for Few-shot Item Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aravind Sankar, Hari Sundaram, Junting Wang, Adit Krishnan</p>
    <p>In recent times, deep learning methods have supplanted conventional collaborative filtering approaches as the backbone of modern recommender systems. However, their gains are skewed towards popular items with a drastic performance drop for the vast collection of long-tail items with sparse interactions. Moreover, we empirically show that prior neural recommenders lack the resolution power to accurately rank relevant items within the long-tail. In this paper, we formulate long-tail item recommendations as a few-shot learning problem of learning-to-recommend few-shot items with very few interactions. We propose a novel meta-learning framework ProtoCF that learns-to-compose robust prototype representations for few-shot items. ProtoCF utilizes episodic few-shot learning to extract meta-knowledge across a collection of diverse meta-training tasks designed to mimic item ranking within the tail. To further enhance discriminative power, we propose a novel architecture-agnostic technique based on knowledge distillation to extract, relate, and transfer knowledge from neural base recommenders. Our experimental results demonstrate that ProtoCF consistently outperforms state-of-art approaches on overall recommendation (by 5% Recall@50) while achieving significant gains (of 60-80% Recall@50) for tail items with less than 20 interactions.</p>
