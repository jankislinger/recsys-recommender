    <h3>Oh, Behave! Country Representation Dynamics Created by Feedback Loops in Music Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Kowald, Markus Schedl, Oleg Lesota, Jonas Geiger, Max Walder</p>
    <p>Recent work suggests that music recommender systems are prone to disproportionally frequent recommendations of music from countries more prominently represented in the training data, notably the US. However, it remains unclear to what extent feedback loops in music recommendation influence the dynamics of such imbalance. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of representation of local (i.e., country-specific) and US-produced music in user profiles and recommendations. To this end, we conduct a feedback loop simulation study using the standardized LFM-2b dataset. The results suggest that most of the investigated recommendation models decrease the proportion of music from local artists in their recommendations. Furthermore, we find that models preserving average proportions of US and local music do not necessarily provide country-calibrated recommendations. We also look into popularity calibration and, surprisingly, find that the most popularity-calibrated model in our study (ItemKNN) provides the least country-calibrated recommendations. In addition, users from less represented countries (e.g., Finland) are, in the long term, most affected by the under-representation of their local music in recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Can editorial decisions impair journal recommendations? Analysing the impact of journal characteristics on recommendation systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elias Entrup, Anett Hoppe, Ralph Ewerth</p>
    <p>Recommendation services for journals help scientists choose appropriate publication venues for their research results. They often use a semantic matching process to compare e.g. an abstract against already published articles. As these services can guide a researcher’s decision, their fairness and neutrality are critical qualities. However, the impact of journal characteristics (such as the abstract length) on recommendations is understudied. In this paper, we investigate whether editorial journal characteristics can lead to biased rankings from recommendation services, i.e. if editorial choices can systematically lead to a better ranking of one’s own journal. The performed experiments show that longer abstracts or a higher number of articles per journal can boost the rank of a journal in the recommendations. We apply these insights to an active, open-source journal recommendation system. The adaptation of the algorithm leads to an increased accuracy for smaller journals.</p>

    <h3>Who is Really Affected by Fraudulent Reviews? (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Soledad Pera, Anu Shrestha, Francesca Spezzano</p>
    <p>We present the results of an initial analysis conducted on a real-life setting to quantify the effect of shilling attacks on recommender systems. We focus on both algorithm performance as well as the types of users who are most affected by these attacks.</p>

    <h3>Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emre Sargin, Jay Adams, Paul Covington</p>
    <p>YouTube represents one of the largest scale and most sophisticated industrial recommendation systems in existence. In this paper, we describe the system at a high level and focus on the dramatic performance improvements brought by deep learning. The paper is split according to the classic two-stage information retrieval dichotomy: first, we detail a deep candidate generation model and then describe a separate deep ranking model. We also provide practical lessons and insights derived from designing, iterating and maintaining a massive recommendation system with enormous user-facing impact.</p>
