    <h3>Beyond Labels: Leveraging Deep Learning and LLMs for Content Metadata (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaya Kawale, Saurabh Agrawal, John Trenkle</p>
    <p>Content metadata plays a very important role in movie recommender systems as it provides valuable information about various aspects of a movie such as genre, cast, plot synopsis, box office summary, etc. Analyzing the metadata can help understand the user preferences and generate personalized recommendations catering to the niche tastes of the users. It can also help with content cold starting when the recommender system has little or no interaction data available to perform collaborative filtering. In this talk, we will focus on one particular type of metadata – genre labels. Genre labels associated with a movie or a TV series such as “horror” or “comedy” or “romance” help categorize a collection of movies into different themes and correspondingly setting up the audience expectation for a title. We present some of the challenges associated with using genre label information via traditional methods and propose a new way of examining the genre information that we call as the Genre Spectrum. The Genre Spectrum helps capture the various nuanced genres in a title and our offline and online experiments corroborate the effectiveness of the approach.</p>

    <h3>Identifying Controversial Pairs in Item-to-Item Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Goodman Gu, Sindhu Vijaya Raghavan, Junyi Shen, Rob Monarch, Jin Cao, Dayvid Rodrigues de Oliveira, Brian Knott</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems in large-scale online marketplaces are essential to aiding users in discovering new content. However, state-of-the-art systems for item-to-item recommendation tasks are often based on a shallow level of contextual relevance, which can make the system insufficient for tasks where item relationships are more nuanced. Contextually relevant item pairs can sometimes have controversial or problematic relationships, and they could degrade user experiences and brand perception when recommended to users. For example, a  recommendation of a divorce and co-parenting book can create a disturbing experience for someone who is downloading or viewing a marriage therapy book. In this paper, we propose a classifier to identify and prevent such problematic item-to-item recommendations and to enhance overall user experiences. The proposed approach utilizes active learning to sample hard examples effectively across sensitive item categories and uses human raters for data labeling. We also perform offline experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of this system for identifying and filtering controversial recommendations while maintaining recommendation quality.</p>

    <h3>Rethinking Personalized Ranking at Pinterest: An End-to-End Approach (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiajing Xu</p>
    <p>In this work, we present our journey to revolutionize the personalized recommendation engine through end-to-end learning from raw user actions. We encode user’s long-term interest in PinnerFormer, a user embedding optimized for long-term future actions via a new dense all-action loss, and capture user’s short-term intention by directly learning from the real-time action sequences. We conducted both offline and online experiments to validate the performance of the new model architecture, and also address the challenge of serving such a complex model using mixed CPU/GPU setup in production. The proposed system has been deployed in production at Pinterest and has delivered significant online gains across organic and Ads applications.</p>

    <h3>Exploration in Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minmin Chen</p>
    <p>In the era of increasing choices, recommender systems are becoming indispensable in helping users navigate the million or billion pieces of content on recommendation platforms. As the focus of these systems shifts from attracting short-term user attention toward optimizing long term user experience on these platforms, reinforcement learning (and bandits) have emerged as appealing techniques to power these systems [5, 9, 26, 27]. The exploration-exploitation tradeoff, being the foundation of bandits and RL research, has been extensively studied [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23]. An agent is incentivized to exploit to maximize its return, i.e., by repeating actions taken in the past that produced high rewards. On the other hand, the agent needs to explore previously unseen actions in order to discover potentially better ones. Exploration has been shown to be extremely useful in solving tasks of long horizons or sparse reward in many RL applications [2, 14, 15, 16, 19]. While effective exploration is believed to positively influence the user experience on the platform, the exact value of exploration in recommender systems has not been well established.<br>In this talk, we examine the roles of exploration in recommender systems in three facets: 1) system exploration to reduce system uncertainty in regions with sparse feedback; 2) user exploration to introduce users to new interests/tastes; and 3) online exploration to take into account real-time user feedback. We showcase how each aspect of exploration contributes to the long term user experience through offline and live experiments on industrial recommendation platforms. We hope this talk can inspire more follow up work in understanding and improving exploration in recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Free Lunch! Retrospective Uplift Modeling for Dynamic Promotions Recommendation within ROI Constraints (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Albert, Lucas Bernardi, Pablo Estevez, Dmitri Goldenberg</p>
    <p>Promotions and discounts have become key components of modern e-commerce platforms. For online travel platforms (OTPs), popular promotions include room upgrades, free meals and transportation services. By offering these promotions, customers can get more value for their money, while both the OTP and its travel partners may grow their loyal customer base. However, the promotions usually incur a cost that, if uncontrolled, can become unsustainable. Consequently, for a promotion to be viable, its associated costs must be balanced by incremental revenue within set financial constraints. Personalized treatment assignment can be used to satisfy such constraints. This paper introduces a novel uplift modeling technique, relying on the Knapsack Problem formulation, that dynamically optimizes the incremental treatment’s outcome subject to the required Return on Investment (ROI) constraints. The technique leverages Retrospective Estimation, a modeling approach that relies solely on data from positive outcome examples. The method also addresses training data bias, long term effects, and seasonality challenges via online-dynamic calibration. This approach was tested via offline experiments and online randomized controlled trials at Booking.com - a leading OTP with millions of customers worldwide, resulting in a significant increase in the target outcome while staying within the required financial constraints and outperforming other approaches.</p>

    <h3>A Joint Dynamic Ranking System with DNN and Vector-based Clustering Bandit (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changping Peng, Jincheng Wang, Xiaoxiao Xu, Weipeng Yan, Yong Li, Yongjun Bao, Yu Liu</p>
    <p>The ad-ranking module is the core of the advertising recommender system. Existing ad-ranking modules are mainly based on the deep neural network click-through rate prediction model. Recently an innovative ad-ranking paradigm called DNN-MAB has been introduced to address DNN-only paradigms’ weakness in perceiving highly dynamic user intent over time. We introduce the DNN-MAB paradigm into our ad-ranking system to alleviate the Matthew effect that harms the user experience. Due to data sparsity, however, the actual performance of DNN-MAB is lower than expected. In this paper, we propose an innovative ad-ranking paradigm called DNN-VMAB to solve these problems. Based on vectorization and clustering, it utilizes latent collaborative information in user behavior data to find a set of ads with higher relativity and diversity. As an integration of the essences of classical collaborative filtering, deep click-through rate prediction model, and contextual multi-armed bandit, it can improve platform revenue and user experience. Both offline and online experiments show the advantage of our new algorithm over DNN-MAB and some other existing algorithms.</p>

    <h3>Sampling-Bias-Corrected Neural Modeling for Large Corpus Item Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyang Yi, Lukasz Heldt, Lichan Hong, Aditee Kumthekar, Li Wei, Derek Zhiyuan Cheng, Zhe Zhao, Ji Yang, Ed Chi</p>
    <p>Many recommendation systems retrieve and score items from a very large corpus. A common recipe to handle data sparsity and power-law item distribution is to learn item representations from its content features. Apart from many content-aware systems based on matrix factorization, we consider a modeling framework using two-tower neural net, with one of the towers (item tower) encoding a wide variety of item content features. A general recipe of training such two-tower models is to optimize loss functions calculated from in-batch negatives, which are items sampled from a random mini-batch. However, in-batch loss is subject to sampling biases, potentially hurting model performance, particularly in the case of highly skewed distribution. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for estimating item frequency from streaming data. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that the proposed algorithm can work without requiring fixed item vocabulary, and is capable of producing unbiased estimation and being adaptive to item distribution change. We then apply the sampling-bias-corrected modeling approach to build a large scale neural retrieval system for YouTube recommendations. The system is deployed to retrieve personalized suggestions from a corpus with tens of millions of videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of sampling-bias correction through offline experiments on two real-world datasets. We also conduct live A/B testings to show that the neural retrieval system leads to improved recommendation quality for YouTube.</p>

    <h3>Switching Hybrid for Cold-Starting Context-Aware Recommender Systems (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Victor Codina, Francesco Ricci, Matthias Braunhofer</p>
    <p>Finding effective solutions for cold-starting context-aware recommender systems (CARSs) is important because usually low quality recommendations are produced for users, items or contextual situations that are new to the system. In this paper, we tackle this problem with a switching hybrid solution that exploits a custom selection of two CARS algorithms, each one suited for a particular cold start situation, and switches between these algorithms depending on the detected recommendation situation (new user, new item or new context). We evaluate the proposed algorithms in an offline experiment by using various contextually-tagged rating datasets. We illustrate some significant performance differences among the considered algorithms and show that they can be effectively combined into the proposed switching hybrid to cope with different types of cold-start problems.</p>
