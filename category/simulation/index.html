    <h3>Navigating the Feedback Loop in Recommender Systems: Insights and Strategies from Industry Practice (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ding Tong, Justin Basilico, James McInerney, Ting-Po Lee, Qifeng Qiao</p>
    <p>Understanding and measuring the impact of feedback loops in industrial recommender systems is challenging, leading to the underestimation of the deterioration. In this study, we define open and closed feedback loops and investigate the unique reasons behind the emergence of feedback loops in the industry, drawing from real-world examples that have received limited attention in prior research. We highlight the measurement challenges associated with capturing the full impact of feedback loops using traditional online A/B tests. To address this, we propose the use of offline evaluation frameworks as surrogates for long-term feedback loop bias, supported by a practical simulation system using real data. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the performance of recommender systems operating under feedback loop conditions.</p>

    <h3>Using Learnable Physics for Real-Time Exercise Form Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gautam Chauhan, Abhishek Jaiswal, Nisheeth Srivastava</p>
    <p>Good posture and form are essential for safe and productive exercising. Even in gym settings, trainers may not be readily available for feedback. Rehabilitation therapies and fitness workouts can thus benefit from recommender systems that provide real-time evaluation. In this paper, we present an algorithmic pipeline that can diagnose problems in exercises technique and offer corrective recommendations, with high sensitivity and specificity, in real-time. We use MediaPipe for pose recognition, count repetitions using peak-prominence detection, and use a learnable physics simulator to track motion evolution for each exercise. A test video is diagnosed based on deviations from the prototypical learned motion using statistical learning. The system is evaluated on six full and upper body exercises. These real-time interactive suggestions counseled via low-cost equipment like smartphones will allow exercisers to rectify potential mistakes making self-practice feasible while reducing the risk of workout injuries.</p>

    <h3>Do recommender systems make social media more susceptible to misinformation spreaders? (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonela Tommasel, Filippo Menczer</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are central to online information consumption and user-decision processes, as they help users find relevant information and establish new social relationships. However, recommenders could also (unintendedly) help propagate misinformation and increase the social influence of the spreading it. In this context, we study the impact of friend recommender systems on the social influence of misinformation spreaders on Twitter. To this end, we applied several user recommenders to a COVID-19 misinformation data collection. Then, we explore what-if scenarios to simulate changes in user misinformation spreading behaviour as an effect of the interactions in the recommended network. Our study shows that recommenders can indeed affect how misinformation spreaders interact with other users and influence them.</p>

    <h3>Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning for Dialog-based Interactive Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Craig Macdonald, Yaxiong Wu, Iadh Ounis</p>
    <p>A dialog-based interactive recommendation task is where users can express natural-language feedback when interacting with the recommender system. However, the users’ feedback, which takes the form of natural-language critiques about the recommendation at each iteration, can only allow the recommender system to obtain a partial portrayal of the users’ preferences. Indeed, such partial observations of the users’ preferences from their natural-language feedback make it challenging to correctly track the users’ preferences over time, which can result in poor recommendation performances and a less effective satisfaction of the users’ information needs when in presence of limited iterations. Reinforcement learning, in the form of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), can simulate the interactions between a partially observable environment (i.e. a user) and an agent (i.e. a recommender system). To alleviate such a partial observation issue, we propose a novel dialog-based recommendation model, the Estimator-Generator-Evaluator (EGE) model, with Q-learning for POMDP, to effectively incorporate the users’ preferences over time. Specifically, we leverage an Estimator to track and estimate users’ preferences, a Generator to match the estimated preferences with the candidate items to rank the next recommendations, and an Evaluator to judge the quality of the estimated preferences considering the users’ historical feedback. Following previous work, we train our EGE model by using a user simulator which itself is trained to describe the differences between the target users’ preferences and the recommended items in natural language. Thorough and extensive experiments conducted on two recommendation datasets – addressing images of fashion products (namely dresses and shoes) – demonstrate that our proposed EGE model yields significant improvements in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art baseline models.</p>

    <h3>Accordion: A Trainable Simulator for Long-Term Interactive Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James McInerney, Ehtsham Elahi, Yves Raimond, Tony Jebara, Justin Basilico</p>
    <p>As machine learning methods are increasingly used in interactive systems it becomes common for user experiences to be the result of an ecosystem of machine learning models in aggregate. Simulation offers a way to deal with the resulting complexity by approximating the real system in a tractable and interpretable manner. Existing methods do not fully incorporate the interactions between user history, recommendation quality, and subsequent visits. We develop Accordion, a trainable simulator based on Poisson processes that can model visit patterns to an interactive system over time from large-scale data. New methods for training and simulation are developed and tested on two datasets of real world interactive systems. Accordion shows greater sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning and offline A/B testing than comparison methods, an important step in building realistic task-oriented simulators for recommendation.</p>
