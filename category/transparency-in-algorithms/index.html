    <h3>Transparently Serving the Public: Enhancing Public Service Media Values through Exploration (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Grün, Xenija Neufeld</p>
    <p>In the last few years, we have reportedly underlined the importance of the Public Service Media Remit for ZDF as a Public Service Media provider. Offering fair, diverse, and useful recommendations to users is just as important for us as being transparent about our understanding of these values, the metrics that we are using to evaluate their extent, and the algorithms in our system that produce such recommendations. This year, we have made a major step towards transparency of our algorithms and metrics describing them for a broader audience, offering the possibility for the audience to learn details about our systems and to provide direct feedback to us. Having the possibility to measure and track PSM metrics, we have started to improve our algorithms towards PSM values. In this work, we describe these steps and the results of actively debasing and adding exploration into our recommendations to achieve more fairness.</p>

    <h3>Challenges Experienced in Public Service Media Recommendation Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Grün</p>
    <p>After multiple years of successfully applying recommendation algorithms at ZDF, a German Public Service Media provider, we have faced certain challenges in regards to the optimization of our systems and the resulting recommendations. The design and the optimization of our systems are guided by various, partially competing objectives and are, therefore, influenced by various factors. Similarly to commercial video on demand services, ZDF is interested in binding its audience by providing personalized recommendations in its streaming media service. However, more importantly, as a Public Service Media provider, we are committed to offer diverse, universal, unbiased, and transparent recommendations while following established editorial guidelines and strict privacy regulations. Additionally, we are committed to provide environmentally-friendly or green recommendations optimizing our systems for run time and power consumption. With the intent to start a public discussion, we describe the challenges that arise when optimizing Public Service Media recommendation systems towards machine learning metrics, business Key Performance Indicators, Public Service Media values, and run-time simultaneously, while aiming to keep the results transparent.</p>
