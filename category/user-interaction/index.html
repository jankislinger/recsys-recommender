    <h3>Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-Behaviour Contrastive Learning for Effective Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iadh Ounis, Zeyuan Meng, Zixuan Yi</p>
    <p>Real-world recommendation scenarios usually need to handle diverse user-item interaction behaviours, including page views, adding items into carts, and purchasing activities. The interactions that precede the actual target behaviour (e.g. purchasing an item) allow to better capture the user’s preferences from different angles, and are used  as auxiliary information (e.g. page views) to enrich the system’s knowledge about the users’ preferences, thereby helping to enhance recommendation for the target behaviour. Despite efforts in modelling the users’ multi-behaviour interaction information, the existing multi-behaviour recommenders  still face two challenges: (1) Data sparsity across multiple user behaviours is a common issue that limits the recommendation performance, particularly for the target behaviour, which typically exhibits fewer interactions compared to other auxiliary behaviours. (2) Noisy auxiliary interactive behaviour where the information in the auxiliary information  might be non-relevant to recommendation.  In this case, a direct  adoption of  contrastive learning between the target behaviour and the auxiliary behaviours will amplify the noise in the auxiliary behaviours, thereby negatively impacting the real semantics that can be derived from the target behaviour. To address these two challenges, we propose a new model called Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-behaviour Contrastive Learning for Recommendation (KEMCL). In particular, to address the problem of sparse user multi-behaviour interaction information, we leverage a tailored knowledge graph (KG) to enrich the semantic representations of items, and generate supervision signals through self-supervised learning so as to enhance  recommendation. In addition, we develop two contrastive learning (CL) methods, inter CL and intra CL, to alleviate the problem of noisy auxiliary interactions. Extensive experiments on three public recommendation datasets show that our proposed KEMCL model significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In particular, our KEMCL model outperforms the best baseline performance, namely KMCLR,  by 5.42% on the large Tmall dataset.</p>

    <h3>AI-based Human-Centered Recommender Systems: Empirical Experiments and Research Infrastructure (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixuan Sun</p>
    <p>This is a dissertation plan built around human-centered empirical experiments evaluating recommender systems (RecSys). We see this as an important research theme since many AI-based RecSys algorithmic studies lack real human assessment. Therefore, we do not know how they work in the wild that only human experiments can tell us. We split this extended abstract into two parts — 1) A series of individual studies focusing on open questions about different human values or recommendation algorithms. Our completed works include user control over content diversity, user appreciation on DL-RecSys algorithms, and human-LLMRec interaction study. We also propose three future works to understand news recommendation depolarization, personalized news podcast, and interactive user representation; 2) An experimentation infrastructure named POPROX. As a personalized news recommendation platform, it aims to support the longitudinal study needs from the general AI and RecSys research community.</p>

    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Natalia Chen, Alexey Zankevich, Nganba Meetei, Nilothpal Talukder</p>
    <p>At Peloton, we constantly strive to improve the member experience by highlighting personalized content that speaks to each individual user. One area of focus is our landing page, the homescreen, consisting of numerous rows of class recommendations used to captivate our users and guide them through our growing catalog of workouts. In this paper, we discuss a strategy we have used to increase the rate of workouts started from our homescreen through a Thompson sampling approach to row ranking, enhanced further with a collaborative filtering method based on user similarity calculated from workout history.</p>

    <h3>Do recommender systems make social media more susceptible to misinformation spreaders? (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonela Tommasel, Filippo Menczer</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are central to online information consumption and user-decision processes, as they help users find relevant information and establish new social relationships. However, recommenders could also (unintendedly) help propagate misinformation and increase the social influence of the spreading it. In this context, we study the impact of friend recommender systems on the social influence of misinformation spreaders on Twitter. To this end, we applied several user recommenders to a COVID-19 misinformation data collection. Then, we explore what-if scenarios to simulate changes in user misinformation spreading behaviour as an effect of the interactions in the recommended network. Our study shows that recommenders can indeed affect how misinformation spreaders interact with other users and influence them.</p>

    <h3>A new sequential dataset logging interactions, all viewed items and click responses/no-click for recommender systems research (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simen Eide</p>
    <p>We present a novel recommender systems dataset that records the sequential interactions between users and an online marketplace. The users are sequentially presented with both recommendations and search results in the form of ranked lists of items, called slates, from the marketplace (figure 1). The dataset includes the presented slates at each round, whether the user clicked on any of these items and which item the user clicked on. Although the usage of exposure data in recommender systems is growing [ 2, 5, 6 , 9 ], to our knowledge there is no open large-scale recommender systems dataset that includes the slates of items presented to the users at each interaction. As a result, most articles on recommender systems do not utilize this exposure information. Instead, the proposed models only depend on the user’s click responses, and assume that the user is exposed to all the items in the item universe at each step, often called uniform candidate sampling ([3 , 7, 8]). This is an incomplete assumption, as it takes into account items the user might not have been exposed to. This way items might be incorrectly considered as not of interest to the user. Taking into account the actually shown slates allows the models to use a more natural likelihood, based on the click probability given the exposure set of items, as is prevalent in the bandit and reinforcement learning literature [1 , 10 , 13, 14 , 17]. [ 6] shows that likelihoods based on uniform candidate sampling (and similar assumptions) are implicitly assuming that the platform only shows the most relevant items to the user. This causes the recommender system to implicitly reinforce feedback loops and to be biased towards previously exposed items to the user. We hope that the release of this dataset can assist researchers to construct more realistic user preference models by utilizing the exposed slates and contribute to more robust offline evaluation criteria using for example importance sampling [ 12 ]. The dataset along with quickstarts and tutorials are available at https://github.com/finn-no/recsys-slates-dataset.</p>

    <h3>Learning a voice-based conversational recommender using offline policy optimization (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francois Mairesse</p>
    <p>Voice-based conversational recommenders offer a natural way to improve recommendation quality by asking the user for missing information. This talk details how we use offline policy optimization to learn a dialog manager that determines what items to present and what clarifying questions to ask, in order to maximize the success of the conversation. Counter-factual learning allows us to compare various modeling techniques using only logged conversational data. Our approach is applied to Amazon Music’s first voice browsing experience (Alexa, help me find music), which interleaves disambiguation questions and music sample suggestions. Offline policy evaluation results show that an XGBoost reward regressor outperforms linear and neural policies on held out data. A first user-facing A/B test confirms our offline results, by increasing our task completion rate by 8% relative compared to our production rule-based conversational recommender, while reducing the number of turns to complete the task by 20%. A second A/B test shows that extending the set of candidate items to present and adding an embedding-based user-item affinity action feature improves task success rate further by 4% relative, while reducing the number of turns further by 13%. These results suggest that offline policy optimization from conversation logs is a viable way to foster conversational recommender research, while minimizing the number of user-facing experiments needed to determine the optimal dialog policy.</p>

    <h3>Fast Multi-Step Critiquing for VAE-based Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boi Faltings, Diego Antognini</p>
    <p>Recent studies have shown that providing personalized explanations alongside recommendations increases trust and perceived quality. Furthermore, it gives users an opportunity to refine the recommendations by critiquing parts of the explanations. On one hand, current recommender systems model the recommendation, explanation, and critiquing objectives jointly, but this creates an inherent trade-off between their respective performance. On the other hand, although recent latent linear critiquing approaches are built upon an existing recommender system, they suffer from computational inefficiency at inference due to the objective optimized at each conversation’s turn. We address these deficiencies with M&Ms-VAE, a novel variational autoencoder for recommendation and explanation that is based on multimodal modeling assumptions. We train the model under a weak supervision scheme to simulate both fully and partially observed variables. Then, we leverage the generalization ability of a trained M&Ms-VAE model to embed the user preference and the critique separately. Our work’s most important innovation is our critiquing module, which is built upon and trained in a self-supervised manner with a simple ranking objective. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that among state-of-the-art models, our system is the first to dominate or match the performance in terms of recommendation, explanation, and multi-step critiquing. Moreover, M&Ms-VAE processes the critiques up to 25.6x faster than the best baselines. Finally, we show that our model infers coherent joint and cross generation, even under weak supervision, thanks to our multimodal-based modeling and training scheme.</p>

    <h3>EntityBot: Supporting Everyday Digital Tasks with Entity Recommendations (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salvatore Andolina, Tung Vuong, Samuel Kaski, Tuukka Ruotsalo, Mats Sjöberg, Giulio Jacucci, Khalil Klouche, Pedram Daee</p>
    <p>Everyday digital tasks can highly benefit from systems that recommend the right information to use at the right time. However, existing solutions typically support only specific applications and tasks. In this demo, we showcase EntityBot, a system that captures context across application boundaries and recommends information entities related to the current task. The user’s digital activity is continuously monitored by capturing all content on the computer screen using optical character recognition. This includes all applications and services being used and specific to individuals’ computer usages such as instant messaging, emailing, web browsing, and word processing. A linear model is then applied to detect the user’s task context to retrieve entities such as applications, documents, contact information, and several keywords determining the task. The system has been evaluated with real-world tasks, demonstrating that the recommendation had an impact on the tasks and led to high user satisfaction.</p>

    <h3>Soliciting User Preferences in Conversational Recommender Systems via Usage-related Questions (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivica Kostric, Filip Radlinski, Krisztian Balog</p>
    <p>A key distinguishing feature of conversational recommender systems over traditional recommender systems is their ability to elicit user preferences using natural language. Currently, the predominant approach to preference elicitation is to ask questions directly about items or item attributes. These strategies do not perform well in cases where the user does not have sufficient knowledge of the target domain to answer such questions. Conversely, in a shopping setting, talking about the planned use of items does not present any difficulties, even for those that are new to a domain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to preference elicitation by asking implicit questions based on item usage. Our approach consists of two main steps. First, we identify the sentences from a large review corpus that contain information about item usage. Then, we generate implicit preference elicitation questions from those sentences using a neural text-to-text model. The main contributions of this work also include a multi-stage data annotation protocol using crowdsourcing for collecting high-quality labeled training data for the neural model. We show that out approach is effective in selecting review sentences and transforming them to elicitation questions, even with limited training data.</p>

    <h3>Using Conceptual Incongruity as a Basis for Making Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nisheeth Srivastava, Tushar Shandhilya</p>
    <p>We evaluate the possibility of using within-item measures of meta-data similarity to improve recommendation rankings along psychologically salient dimensions of incongruity and creativity. Our approach contrasts with recently developed methods at introducing diversity into recommendations which rely on across-item measurements of dissimilarity, while sharing several formal and algorithmic elements. We show that semantic distance based operationalizations of psychological constructs show substantial correlation with empirical data. We further show that incongruity predicts variability in satisfaction as measured by movie ratings in a large corpus. Empirical results from a two month-long user study demonstrate that incongruity-based recommendations attract considerably more interaction from users, and users expressed significantly greater satisfaction given these recommendations. Based on these observations, we propose that using incongruity to diversify recommendations may be useful in expanding recommendation repertoires along interesting psychological dimensions, complementing relevance-based search.</p>

    <h3>In-Store Augmented Reality-Enabled Product Comparison and Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jürgen Ziegler, Jesús Omar Álvarez Márquez</p>
    <p>We present an approach combining the AR-based presentation of product attributes in a physical retail store with recommendations for items only available online. The system supports users’ decision-making process by offering functions for comparing product features between items, both physical and online, and by providing recommendations based on selecting in-store products. The physical products may thus serve as anchors for forming the user’s preferences, also offering a richer and more engaging experience when exploring the products hands-on. Both objective product attributes as well as the visual appearance of a physical product are employed for generating recommendations from the online space. In this way, the advantages of online and in-store shopping can be combined, creating novel multi-channel opportunities for businesses. An empirical evaluation showed that the comparison and recommendation functions were appreciated by users, and hinted some possible benefits of a hybrid physical-online shopping support system. Despite the limitations of the study, there is sufficient evidence to consider this a viable approach worth to be further explored.</p>

    <h3>Who Doesn’t Like Dinosaurs? Finding and Eliciting Richer Preferences for Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Schnabel, Gonzalo Ramos, Saleema Amershi</p>
    <p>Real-world recommender systems often allow users to adjust the presented content through a variety of preference elicitation techniques such as “liking” or interest profiles. These elicitation techniques trade-off time and effort to users with the richness of the signal they provide to learning component driving the recommendations. In this paper, we explore this trade-off, seeking new ways for people to express their preferences with the goal of improving communication channels between users and the recommender system. Through a need-finding study, we observe the patterns in how people express their preferences during curation task, propose a taxonomy for organizing them, and point out research opportunities. We present a case study that illustrates how using this taxonomy to design an onboarding experience can lead to more accurate machine-learned recommendations while maintaining user satisfaction under low effort.</p>

    <h3>Multi-Armed Recommender System Bandit Ensembles (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcos Redondo, Rocío Cañamares, Pablo Castells</p>
    <p>It has long been found that well-configured recommender system ensembles can achieve better effectiveness than the combined systems separately. Sophisticated approaches have been developed to automatically optimize the ensembles’ configuration to maximize their performance gains. However most work in this area has targeted simplified scenarios where algorithms are tested and compared on a single non-interactive run. In this paper we consider a more realistic perspective bearing in mind the cyclic nature of the recommendation task, where a large part of the system’s input is collected from the reaction of users to the recommendations they are delivered. The cyclic process provides the opportunity for ensembles to observe and learn about the effectiveness of the combined algorithms, and improve the ensemble configuration progressively. In this paper we explore the adaptation of a multi-armed bandit approach to achieve this, by representing the combined systems as arms, and the ensemble as a bandit that at each step selects an arm to produce the next round of recommendations. We report experiments showing the effectiveness of this approach compared to ensembles that lack the iterative perspective. Along the way, we find illustrative pitfall examples that can result from common, single-shot offline evaluation setups. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <p>The dynamics of the labor market and the tasks with which jobs are being composed are continuously evolving. Job mobility is not evident, and providing effective recommendations in this context has also been found to be particularly challenging. In this paper, we present Labor Market Explorer, an interactive dashboard that enables job seekers to explore the labor market in a personalized way based on their skills and competences. Through a user-centered design process involving job seekers and job mediators, we developed this dashboard to enable job seekers to explore job recommendations and their required competencies, as well as how these competencies map to their profile. Evaluation results indicate the dashboard empowers job seekers to explore, understand, and find relevant vacancies, mostly independent of their background and age.</p>
