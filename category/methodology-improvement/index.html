    <h3>Revisiting BPR: A Replicability Study of a Common Recommender System Baseline (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandr Milogradskii, Oleg Lashinin, Sergey Kolesnikov, Alexander P, Marina Ananyeva</p>
    <p>Bayesian Personalized Rank (BPR), a collaborative filtering approach based on matrix factorization, frequently serves as a benchmark for recommender systems research. However, numerous studies often overlook the nuances of BPR implementation, claiming that it performs worse than newly proposed methods across various tasks. In this paper, we thoroughly examine the features of the BPR model, indicating their impact on its performance, and investigate open-source BPR implementations. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies between these implementations and the original BPR paper, leading to a significant decrease in performance of up to 50% for specific implementations. Furthermore, through extensive experiments on real-world datasets under modern evaluation settings, we demonstrate that with proper tuning of its hyperparameters, the BPR model can achieve performance levels close to state-of-the-art methods on the top-n recommendation tasks and even outperform them on specific datasets. Specifically, on the Million Song Dataset, the BPR model with hyperparameters tuning statistically significantly outperforms Mult-VAE by 10% in NDCG@100 with binary relevance function.</p>

    <h3>Enhancing Counterfactual Evaluation and Learning for Recommendation Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicol√≤ Felicioni</p>
    <p>Evaluating recommendation systems is a task of utmost importance and a very active research field. While online evaluation is the most reliable evaluation procedure, it may also be too expensive to perform, if not unfeasible. Therefore, researchers and practitioners resort to offline evaluation. Offline evaluation is much more efficient and scalable, but traditional approaches suffer from high bias. This issue led to the increased popularity of counterfactual techniques. These techniques are used for evaluation and learning in recommender systems and reduce the bias in offline evaluation. While counterfactual approaches have a solid statistical basis, their application to recommendation systems is still in a preliminary research phase. In this paper, we identify some limitations of counterfactual techniques applied to recommender systems, and we propose possible ways to overcome them.</p>
