    <h3>LLMs for User Interest Exploration: A Hybrid Approach (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> He Ma, Haokai Lu, Yueqi Wang, Yifan Liu, Ed H. Chi, Lexi Baugher, Ningren Han, Shuzhou Zhang, Yang Gu, Jianling Wang, Minmin Chen, Shuchao Bi</p>
    <p>Traditional recommendation systems are subject to a strong feedback loop by learning from and reinforcing past user-item interactions, which in turn limits the discovery of novel user interests. To address this, we introduce a hybrid hierarchical framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and classic recommendation models for user interest exploration. The framework controls the interfacing between the LLMs and the classic recommendation models through “interest clusters”, the granularity of which can be explicitly determined by algorithm designers. It recommends the next novel interests by first representing “interest clusters” using language, and employs a fine-tuned LLM to generate novel interest descriptions that are strictly within these predefined clusters. At the low level, it grounds these generated interests to an item-level policy by restricting classic recommendation models, in this case a transformer-based sequence recommender to return items that fall within the novel clusters generated at the high level. We showcase the efficacy of this approach on an industrial-scale commercial platform serving billions of users. Live experiments show a significant increase in both exploration of novel interests and overall user enjoyment of the platform.</p>

    <h3>Music Recommendations in Hyperbolic Space: An Application of Empirical Bayes and Hierarchical Poincaré Embeddings (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph Chisari, Sam Garrett, Timothy Schmeier, Brett Vintch</p>
    <p>Matrix Factorization (MF) is a common method for generating recommendations, where the proximity of entities like users or items in the embedded space indicates their similarity to one another. Though almost all applications implicitly use a Euclidean embedding space to represent two entity types, recent work has suggested that a hyperbolic Poincare ball may be more well suited to representing multiple entity types, and in particular, hierarchies. We describe a novel method to embed a hierarchy of related music entities in hyperbolic space. We also describe how a parametric empirical Bayes approach can be used to estimate link reliability between entities in the hierarchy. Applying these methods together to build personalized playlists for users in a digital music service yielded a large and statistically significant increase in performance during an A/B test, as compared to the Euclidean model. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>
