    <h3>Advancing Automation of Design Decisions in Recommender System Pipelines (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Vente</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have become essential in domains like streaming services, social media platforms, and e-commerce websites.  However, the development of a recommender system involves a complex pipeline with preprocessing, data splitting, algorithm and model selection, and postprocessing stages, requiring critical design decisions.  Every stage of the recommender systems pipeline requires design decisions that influence the performance of the recommender system. To ease design decisions, automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques have been adapted to the field of recommender systems, resulting in various AutoRecSys libraries.  Nevertheless, these libraries lack library independence and limit flexibility in integrating automation techniques from different sources. In response, our research aims to enhance the usability of AutoML techniques for design decisions in recommender system pipelines.  We focus on developing flexible and library-independent automation techniques for algorithm selection, model selection, and postprocessing steps.  By enabling developers to make informed choices and ease the recommender system development process, we decrease the developer’s effort while improving the performance of the recommender systems.  Moreover, we want to analyze the cost-to-benefit ratio of automation techniques in recommender systems, evaluating the computational overhead and the resulting improvements in predictive performance.  Our objective is to leverage AutoML concepts to automate design decisions in recommender system pipelines, reduce manual effort, and enhance the overall performance and usability of recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Who do you think I am? Interactive User Modelling with Item Metadata (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bart Goethals, Koen Ruymbeek, Joey De Pauw</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are used in many different applications and contexts, however their main goal can always be summarised as “connecting relevant content to interested users”. Explanations have been found to help recommender systems achieve this goal by giving users a look under the hood that helps them understand why they are recommended certain items. Furthermore, explanations can be considered to be the first step towards interacting with the system. Indeed, for a user to give feedback and guide the system towards better understanding her preferences, it helps if the user has a better idea of what the system has already learned.<br>To this end, we propose a linear collaborative filtering recommendation model that builds user profiles within the domain of item metadata. Our method is hence inherently transparent and explainable. Moreover, since recommendations are computed as a linear function of item metadata and the interpretable user profile, our method seamlessly supports interactive recommendation. In other words, users can directly tweak the weights of the learned profile for more fine-grained browsing and discovery of content based on their current interests. We demonstrate the interactive aspect of this model in an online application for discovering cultural events in Belgium.</p>

    <h3>Who Doesn’t Like Dinosaurs? Finding and Eliciting Richer Preferences for Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Schnabel, Gonzalo Ramos, Saleema Amershi</p>
    <p>Real-world recommender systems often allow users to adjust the presented content through a variety of preference elicitation techniques such as “liking” or interest profiles. These elicitation techniques trade-off time and effort to users with the richness of the signal they provide to learning component driving the recommendations. In this paper, we explore this trade-off, seeking new ways for people to express their preferences with the goal of improving communication channels between users and the recommender system. Through a need-finding study, we observe the patterns in how people express their preferences during curation task, propose a taxonomy for organizing them, and point out research opportunities. We present a case study that illustrates how using this taxonomy to design an onboarding experience can lead to more accurate machine-learned recommendations while maintaining user satisfaction under low effort.</p>

    <h3>Recommendations as Graph Explorations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marialena Kyriakidi, Yannis Ioannidis, Georgia Koutrika</p>
    <p>We argue that most recommendation approaches can be abstracted as a graph exploration problem. In particular, we describe a graph-theoretic framework with two primary parts: (a) a recommendation graph, modeling all the elements of an (application) domain from a recommendation perspective, including the subjects and objects of recommendations as well as the relationships between them; (b) a set of path operations, inferring new edges, i.e., implicit or unknown relationships, by traversing and combining paths on the graph. The resulting path algebra model provides an abstraction and a common foundation that is beneficial to three aspects of recommendations: (a) expressive power - expression and subsequent use of several significantly different, existing but also novel recommendation approaches is reduced to parameterizing a unique model; (b) usability - by capturing part of the recommendation mechanisms in the underlying path algebra semantics, specification of recommendation approaches becomes easier and less tedious; (c) processing speed - implementing recommender systems on top of graph engines opens up the door for several optimizations that speed up execution. We demonstrate the above benefits by expressing several categories of recommendation approaches in the path algebra model and benchmarking some of them in a recommender system implemented on top of Neo4J, a widely used graph system.</p>

    <h3>Designing for the Better by Taking Users into Account: A Qualitative Evaluation of User Control Mechanisms in (News) Recommender Systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaron Harambam, Mykola Makhortykh, Dimitrios Bountouridis, Joris van Hoboken</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RS) are on the rise in many domains. While they offer great promises, they also raise concerns: lack of transparency, reduction of diversity, little to no user control. In this paper, we align with the normative turn in computer science which scrutinizes the ethical and societal implications of RS. We focus and elaborate on the concept of user control because that mitigates multiple problems at once. Taking the news industry as our domain, we conducted four focus groups, or moderated think-aloud sessions, with Dutch news readers (N=21) to systematically study how people evaluate different control mechanisms (at the input, process, and output phase) in a News Recommender Prototype (NRP). While these mechanisms are sometimes met with distrust about the actual control they offer, we found that an intelligible user profile (including reading history and flexible preferences settings), coupled with possibilities to influence the recommendation algorithms is highly valued, especially when these control mechanisms can be operated in relation to achieving personal goals. By bringing (future) users’ perspectives to the fore, this paper contributes to a  richer understanding of why and how to design for user control in recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>The Role of Prior Experience in User’s Engagement with a New Recommender System (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Analia Amandi, Silvia Schiaffino, Marcelo Gabriel Armentano</p>
    <p>In this article we performed an online experiment to test the role of the user’s prior experience with recommender systems in his/her engagement with a new recommendation technology. Our research model is based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) with two new constructs corresponding to the simplicity of the graphical user interface and the skills the user believe he/she has to use recommender systems. Our experiments confirmed the hypothesis that prior user experience plays an important role in which factors affect the user engagement with a new system.</p>
