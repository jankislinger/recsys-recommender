    <h3>A Tool for Explainable Pension Fund Recommendations using Large Language Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edleno Silva de Moura, Eduardo Alves da Silva, Leandro Balby Marinho, Altigran Soares da Silva</p>
    <p>In this demo, we present a prototype tool designed to help financial advisors recommend private pension funds to investors based on their preferences, offering personalized investment suggestions. The tool leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), which enhance explainability by providing clear and understandable rationales for recommendations and effectively handles both sequential and cold-start scenarios. We outline the design, implementation, and results of a user-based evaluation using real-world data. The evaluation shows a high recommendation acceptance rate among financial advisors, highlighting the toolâ€™s potential to improve decision-making in financial advisory services.</p>

    <h3>From Preference into Decision Making: Modeling User Interactions in Recommender Systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gediminas Adomavicius, Qian Zhao, Martijn C. Willemsen, F. Maxwell Harper, Joseph A. Konstan</p>
    <p>User-system interaction in recommender systems involves three aspects: temporal browsing (viewing recommendation lists and/or searching/filtering), action (performing actions on recommended items, e.g., clicking, consuming) and inaction (neglecting or skipping recommended items). Modern recommenders build machine learning models from recordings of such user interaction with the system, and in doing so they commonly make certain assumptions (e.g., pairwise preference orders, independent or competitive probabilistic choices, etc.). In this paper, we set out to study the effects of these assumptions along three dimensions in eight different single models and three associated hybrid models on a user browsing data set collected from a real-world recommender system application. We further design a novel model based on recurrent neural networks and multi-task learning, inspired by Decision Field Theory, a model of human decision making. We report on precision, recall, and MAP, finding that this new model outperforms the others.</p>

    <h3>Predicting Online Performance of Job Recommender Systems With Offline Evaluation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrien Mogenet, Tuan Anh Nguyen Pham, Masahiro Kazama, Jialin Kong</p>
    <p>Recommender systems can be used to recommend jobs. In this context, implicit and explicit feedback signals we can collect are rare events, making the task of evaluation more complex. Online evaluation (A-B testing) is usually the most reliable way to measure the results from our experiments, but it is a slow process. In contrast, the offline evaluation process is faster, but it is critical to make it reliable as it informs our decision to roll out new improvements in production. In this paper, we review the comparative offline and online performances of three recommendations models, we describe the evaluation metrics we use and analyze how the offline performance metrics correlate with online metrics to understand how an offline evaluation process can be leveraged to inform the decisions. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>A Crowdsourcing Triage Algorithm for Geopolitical Forecasting (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Huber, Tsai-Ching Lu, Mohammad Rostami</p>
    <p>Predicting the outcome of geopolitical events is of huge importance to many organizations, as these forecasts provide actionable intelligence that may be used to make consequential decisions. Prediction polling is a common method used in crowdsourcing platforms for geopolitical forecasting, where a group of non-expert participants are asked to predict the outcome of a geopolitical event and the collected responses are aggregated to generate a forecast. It has been demonstrated that forecasts by such a crowd can be more accurate than the forecasts of experts. However, geopolitical prediction polling is challenging because participants are highly heterogeneous and diverse in terms of their skills and background knowledge and human resources are often limited. As a result, it is crucial to refer each question to the subset of participants that possess suitable skills to answer it, such that individual efforts are not wasted. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on multitask learning to learn the skills of participants of a forecasting platform by using their performance history. The learned model then can be used to recommend suitable questions to forecasters. Our experimental results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy can be increased based on the proposed algorithm as opposed to when questions have been randomly assigned.</p>

    <h3>Multi-Criteria Journey Aware Housing Recommender System (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adi Botea, Elizabeth Daly, Akihiro Kishimoto, Radu Marinescu</p>
    <p>Recommender systems can be employed to assist users in complex decision making processes. This paper presents a multi-criteria housing recommender system which takes into account not just features of a home, such as rent, but also the transportation links to user specified locations. First, we describe an efficient multi-hop journey time calculator. Second, we introduce a mechanism to find the optimal solutions for multi-criteria evaluation, where a balanced trade-off between the target goals is found. Finally, we present a user study to demonstrate the potential of such a system.</p>
