    <h3>beeFormer: Bridging the Gap Between Semantic and Interaction Similarity in Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vojtěch Vančura, Milan Straka, Pavel Kordík</p>
    <p>Recommender systems often use text-side information to improve their predictions, especially in cold-start or zero-shot recommendation scenarios, where traditional collaborative filtering approaches cannot be used. Many approaches to text-mining side information for recommender systems have been proposed over recent years, with sentence Transformers being the most prominent one. However, these models are trained to predict semantic similarity without utilizing interaction data with hidden patterns specific to recommender systems. In this paper, we propose beeFormer, a framework for training sentence Transformer models with interaction data. We demonstrate that our models trained with beeFormer can transfer knowledge between datasets while outperforming not only semantic similarity sentence Transformers but also traditional collaborative filtering methods. We also show that training on multiple datasets from different domains accumulates knowledge in a single model, unlocking the possibility of training universal, domain-agnostic sentence Transformer models to mine text representations for recommender systems. We release the source code, trained models, and additional details allowing replication of our experiments at https://github.com/recombee/beeformer.</p>

    <h3>Vista: A Visually, Socially, and Temporally-aware Model for Artistic Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaowen Wang, Ruining He, Chen Fang, Julian McAuley</p>
    <p>Understanding users’ interactions with highly subjective content—like artistic images—is challenging due to the complex semantics that guide our preferences. On the one hand one has to overcome `standard’ recommender systems challenges, such as dealing with large, sparse, and long-tailed datasets. On the other, several new challenges present themselves, such as the need to model content in terms of its visual appearance, or even social dynamics, such as a preference toward a particular artist that is independent of the art they create. In this paper we build large-scale recommender systems to model the dynamics of a vibrant digital art community, Behance, consisting of tens of millions of interactions (clicks and `appreciates’) of users toward digital art. Methodologically, our main contributions are to model (a) rich content, especially in terms of its visual appearance; (b) temporal dynamics, in terms of how users prefer `visually consistent’ content within and across sessions; and (c) social dynamics, in terms of how users exhibit preferences both towards certain art styles, as well as the artists themselves.</p>
