    <h3>Scalable Approximate NonSymmetric Autoencoder for Collaborative Filtering (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ladislav Peška, Radek Bartyzal, Antonín Hoskovec, Martin Spišák, Miroslav Tůma</p>
    <p>In the field of recommender systems, shallow autoencoders have recently gained significant attention. One of the most highly acclaimed shallow autoencoders is EASE, favored for its competitive recommendation accuracy and simultaneous simplicity. However, the poor scalability of EASE (both in time and especially in memory) severely restricts its use in production environments with vast item sets. In this paper, we propose a hyperefficient factorization technique for sparse approximate inversion of the data-Gram matrix used in EASE. The resulting autoencoder, SANSA, is an end-to-end sparse solution with prescribable density and almost arbitrarily low memory requirements (even for training). As such, SANSA allows us to effortlessly scale the concept of EASE to millions of items and beyond.</p>

    <h3>Effective and Efficient Training for Sequential Recommendation using Recency Sampling (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandr Petrov, Craig Macdonald</p>
    <p>Many modern sequential recommender systems use deep neural networks, which can effectively estimate the relevance of items but require a lot of time to train. Slow training increases expenses, hinders product development timescales and prevents the model from being regularly updated to adapt to changing user preferences. Training such sequential models involves appropriately sampling past user interactions to create a realistic training objective. The existing training objectives have limitations. For instance, next item prediction never uses the beginning of the sequence as a learning target, thereby potentially discarding valuable data. On the other hand, the item masking used by BERT4Rec is only weakly related to the goal of the sequential recommendation; therefore, it requires much more time to obtain an effective model. Hence, we propose a novel Recency-based Sampling of Sequences training objective that addresses both limitations. We apply our method to various recent and state-of-the-art model architectures – such as GRU4Rec, Caser, and SASRec. We show that the models enhanced with our method can achieve performances exceeding or very close to state-of-the-art BERT4Rec, but with much less training time.</p>

    <h3>Imbalanced Data Sparsity as Source of Unfair Bias in Collaborative Filtering (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chin Lin Wong, Fernando Mourão, Farhad Zafari, Sabir Ribas, Saumya Pandey, Aditya Joshi, Diego Marinho de Oliveira</p>
    <p>Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a class of methods widely used to support high-quality Recommender Systems (RSs) across several industries [6]. Studies have uncovered distinct advantages and limitations of CF in many real-world applications [5, 9]. Besides the inability to address the cold-start problem, sensitivity to data sparsity is among the main limitations recurrently associated with this class of RSs. Past work has extensively demonstrated that data sparsity critically impacts CF accuracy [2, 3, 4]. The proposed talk revisits the relation between data sparsity and CF from a new perspective, evincing that the former also impacts the fairness of recommendations. In particular, data sparsity might lead to unfair bias in domains where the volume of activity strongly correlates with personal characteristics that are protected by law (i.e., protected attributes). This concern is critical for RSs deployed in domains such as the recruitment domain, where RSs have been reported to automate or facilitate discriminatory behaviour [7]. Our work at SEEK deals with recommender algorithms that recommend jobs to candidates via SEEK’s multiple channels. While this talk focuses on our perspective of the problem in the job recommendation domain, the discussion is relevant to many other domains where recommenders potentially have a social or economic impact on the lives of individuals and groups.</p>
