    <h3>Reciprocal Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Zheng, Hengshu Zhu, Yang Song, Wayne Xin Zhao, Yupeng Hou</p>
    <p>Reciprocal recommender system (RRS), considering a two-way matching between two parties, has been widely applied in online platforms like online dating and recruitment. Existing RRS models mainly capture static user preferences, which have neglected the evolving user tastes and the dynamic matching relation between the two parties. Although dynamic user modeling has been well-studied in sequential recommender systems, existing solutions are developed in a user-oriented manner. Therefore, it is non-trivial to adapt sequential recommendation algorithms to reciprocal recommendation. In this paper, we formulate RRS as a distinctive sequence matching task, and further propose a new approach ReSeq for RRS, which is short for Reciprocal Sequential recommendation. To capture duel-perspective matching, we propose to learn fine-grained sequence similarities by co-attention mechanism across different time steps. Further, to improve the inference efficiency, we introduce the self-distillation technique to distill knowledge from the fine-grained matching module into the more efficient student module. In the deployment stage, only the efficient student module is used, greatly speeding up the similarity computation. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets from two scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReSeq/.</p>

    <h3>Modeling User Repeat Consumption Behavior for Online Novel Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cunxiang Yin, Leeven Luo, Yuncong Li, Yancheng He, Guoqiang Xu, Jing Cai, Sheng-hua Zhong</p>
    <p>Given a user’s historical interaction sequence, online novel recommendation suggests the next novel the user may be interested in. Online novel recommendation is important but underexplored. In this paper, we concentrate on recommending online novels to new users of an online novel reading platform, whose first visits to the platform occurred in the last seven days. We have two observations about online novel recommendation for new users. First, repeat novel consumption of new users is a common phenomenon. Second, interactions between users and novels are informative. To accurately predict whether a user will reconsume a novel, it is crucial to characterize each interaction at a fine-grained level. Based on these two observations, we propose a neural network for online novel recommendation, called NovelNet. NovelNet can recommend the next novel from both the user’s consumed novels and new novels simultaneously. Specifically, an interaction encoder is used to obtain accurate interaction representation considering fine-grained attributes of interaction, and a pointer network with a pointwise loss is incorporated into NovelNet to recommend previously-consumed novels. Moreover, an online novel recommendation dataset is built from a well-known online novel reading platform and is released for public use as a benchmark. Experimental results on the dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of NovelNet 1.</p>

    <h3>Contextual User Browsing Bandits for Large-Scale Online Mobile Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xu He, Haikai Chen, Bo An, Qingyu Guo, Yanghua Li, Zhirong Wang, Xin Li</p>
    <p>Online recommendation services recommend multiple commodities to users. Nowadays, a considerable proportion of users visit e-commerce platforms by mobile devices. Due to the limited screen size of mobile devices, positions of items have a significant influence on clicks: 1) Higher positions lead to more clicks for one commodity. 2) The ‘pseudo-exposure’ issue: Only a few recommended items are shown at first glance and users need to slide the screen to browse other items. Therefore, some recommended items ranked behind are not viewed by users and it is not proper to treat this kind of items as negative samples. While many works model the online recommendation as contextual bandit problems, they rarely take the influence of positions into consideration and thus the estimation of the reward function may be biased. In this paper, we aim at addressing these two issues to improve the performance of online mobile recommendation. Our contributions are four-fold. First, since we concern the reward of a set of recommended items, we model the online recommendation as a contextual combinatorial bandit problem and define the reward of a recommended set. Second, we propose a novel contextual combinatorial bandit method called UBM-LinUCB to address two issues related to positions by adopting the User Browsing Model (UBM), a click model for web search. Third, we provide a formal regret analysis and prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret independent of the number of items. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on two real-world datasets by a novel unbiased estimator. An online experiment is also implemented in Taobao, one of the most popular e-commerce platforms in the world. Results on two CTR metrics show that our algorithm outperforms the other contextual bandit algorithms.</p>
