    <h3>A new sequential dataset logging interactions, all viewed items and click responses/no-click for recommender systems research (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simen Eide</p>
    <p>We present a novel recommender systems dataset that records the sequential interactions between users and an online marketplace. The users are sequentially presented with both recommendations and search results in the form of ranked lists of items, called slates, from the marketplace (figure 1). The dataset includes the presented slates at each round, whether the user clicked on any of these items and which item the user clicked on. Although the usage of exposure data in recommender systems is growing [ 2, 5, 6 , 9 ], to our knowledge there is no open large-scale recommender systems dataset that includes the slates of items presented to the users at each interaction. As a result, most articles on recommender systems do not utilize this exposure information. Instead, the proposed models only depend on the user’s click responses, and assume that the user is exposed to all the items in the item universe at each step, often called uniform candidate sampling ([3 , 7, 8]). This is an incomplete assumption, as it takes into account items the user might not have been exposed to. This way items might be incorrectly considered as not of interest to the user. Taking into account the actually shown slates allows the models to use a more natural likelihood, based on the click probability given the exposure set of items, as is prevalent in the bandit and reinforcement learning literature [1 , 10 , 13, 14 , 17]. [ 6] shows that likelihoods based on uniform candidate sampling (and similar assumptions) are implicitly assuming that the platform only shows the most relevant items to the user. This causes the recommender system to implicitly reinforce feedback loops and to be biased towards previously exposed items to the user. We hope that the release of this dataset can assist researchers to construct more realistic user preference models by utilizing the exposed slates and contribute to more robust offline evaluation criteria using for example importance sampling [ 12 ]. The dataset along with quickstarts and tutorials are available at https://github.com/finn-no/recsys-slates-dataset.</p>

    <h3>Pick &amp; Merge: An Efficient Item Filtering Scheme for Windows Store Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nir Nice, Adi Makmal, Liron Allerhand, Jonathan Ephrath, Hilik Berezin, Noam Koenigstein</p>
    <p>Microsoft Windows is the most popular operating system (OS) for personal computers (PCs). With hundreds of millions of users, its app marketplace, Windows Store, is one of the largest in the world. As such, special considerations are required in order to improve online computational efficiency and response times. This paper presents the results of an extensive research of effective filtering method for semi-personalized recommendations. The filtering problem, defined here for the first time, addresses an aspect that was so far largely overlooked by the recommender systems literature, namely effective and efficient method for removing items from semi-personalized recommendation lists. Semi-personalized recommendation lists serve a common list to a group of people based on their shared interest or background. Unlike fully personalized lists, these lists are cacheable and constitute the majority of recommendation lists in many online stores. This motivates the following question: can we remove (most of) the users’ undesired items without collapsing onto fully personalized recommendations?Our solution is based on dividing the users into few subgroups, such that each subgroup receives a different variant of the original recommendation list. This approach adheres to the principles of semi-personalization and hence preserves simplicity and cacheability. We formalize the problem of finding optimal subgroups that minimize the total number of filtering errors, and show that it is combinatorially formidable. Consequently, a greedy algorithm is proposed that filters out most of the undesired items, while bounding the maximal number of errors for each user. Finally, a detailed evaluation of the proposed algorithm is presented using both proprietary and public datasets. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>
