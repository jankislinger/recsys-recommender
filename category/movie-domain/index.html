    <h3>Do Users Appreciate Explanations of Recommendations? An Analysis in the Movie Domain (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Felfernig, Viet Man Le, Martin Stettinger, Muesluem Atas, Thi Ngoc Trang Tran</p>
    <p>In this paper, we provide insights into users’ needs regarding the inclusion of explanations in a movie recommender system. We have developed different variants of a movie recommender system prototype corresponding to different types of explanations and conducted an online user study to evaluate related explanations. The experimental results show that users do not always appreciate explanations. They want to see explanations when they are not satisfied with the recommended items. They expect to see explanations showing how well the recommended item meets their preferences. Moreover, explanation goals are interdependent and affect the overall satisfaction of users with the recommender system.</p>

    <h3>Ensuring Fairness in Group Recommendations by Rank-Sensitive Balancing of Relevance (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Derek Bridge, Mesut Kaya, Nava Tintarev</p>
    <p>For group recommendations, one objective is to recommend an ordered set of items, a top-N, to a group such that each individual recommendation is relevant for everyone. A common way to do this is to select items on which the group can agree, using so-called ‘aggregation strategies’. One weakness of these aggregation strategies is that they select items independently of each other. They therefore cannot guarantee properties such as fairness, that apply to the set of recommendations as a whole.<br>In this paper, we give a definition of fairness that ‘balances’ the relevance of the recommended items across the group members in a rank-sensitive way. Informally, an ordered set of recommended items is considered fair to a group if the relevance of the items in the top-N is balanced across the group members for each prefix of the top-N. In other words, the first item in the top-N should, as far as possible, balance the interests of all group members; the first two items taken together must do the same; also the first three; and so on up to N. In this paper, we formalize this notion of rank-sensitive balance and provide a greedy algorithm (GFAR) for finding a top-N set of group recommendations that satisfies our definition.<br>We compare the performance of GFAR to five approaches from the literature on two datasets, one from each of the movie and music domains. We evaluate performance for 42 different configurations (two datasets, seven different group sizes, three different group types) and for ten evaluation metrics. We find that GFAR performs significantly better than all other algorithms around 43% of the time; in only 10% of cases are there algorithms that are significantly better than GFAR. Furthermore, GFAR performs particularly well in the most difficult cases, where groups are large and interests within the group diverge. We attribute GFAR’s success both to its rank-sensitivity and its way of balancing relevance. Current methods do not define fairness in a rank-sensitive way (although some achieve a degree of rank-sensitivity through the use of greedy algorithms) and none define balance in the way that we do.</p>

    <h3>Combining Text Summarization and Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis of Users’ Reviews to Justify Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Lops, Giovanni Semeraro, Marco de Gemmis, Cataldo Musto, Gaetano Rossiello</p>
    <p>In this paper we present a methodology to justify recommendations that relies on the information extracted from users’ reviews discussing the available items. The intuition behind the approach is to conceive the justification as a summary of the most relevant and distinguishing aspects ofthe item, automatically obtained by analyzing the available reviews. To this end, we designed a pipeline of natural language processing techniques based on aspect extraction, sentiment analysis and text summarization to gather the reviews, process the relevant excerpts,and generate a unique synthesis presenting the main characteristics of the item. Such a summary is finally presented to the target user as justification of the recommendation she received. In the experimental evaluation we carried out a user study in the movie domain (N=141) and the results showed that our approach is able to make the recommendation process more transparent, engaging and trustful for the users. Moreover, the proposed method also beat another review-based explanation technique, thus confirming the validity of our intuition. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Exploring Recommendations Under User-Controlled Data Filtering (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longqi Yang, Deborah Estrin, Michael Sobolev, Hongyi Wen</p>
    <p>Traditionally, recommendation systems are built on the assumption that each service provider has full access to all user data generated on its platform. However, with increasing data privacy concerns and personal data protection regulation, service providers, such as Google, Twitter, and Facebook, are enabling their users to revisit, erase, and rectify their historical profiles. Future recommendation systems need to be robust to such profile modifications and user-controlled data filtering. In this paper, we explore how recommendation performance may be affected by time-sensitive user data filtering, i.e., users choosing to share only recent “N days” of data. Using the MovieLens dataset as a testbed, we evaluate three state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that filtering out historical user data does not significantly affect the overall recommendation performance, but its impact on individual users may vary. These findings challenge the common belief that more data produces better performance, and suggest a potential win-win solution for services and end users.</p>

    <h3>RecGAN: Recurrent Generative Adversarial Networks for Recommendation Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Homin Park, Homanga Bharadhwaj, Brian Y. Lim</p>
    <p>Recent studies in recommendation systems emphasize the significance of modeling latent features behind temporal evolution of user preference and item state to make relevant suggestions. However, static and dynamic behaviors and trends of users and items, which highly influence the feasibility of recommendations, were not adequately addressed in previous works. In this work, we leverage the temporal and latent feature modelling capabilities of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), respectively, to propose a Recurrent Generative Adversarial Network (RecGAN). We use customized Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells to capture latent features of users and items observable from short-term and long-term temporal profiles. The modification also includes collaborative filtering mechanisms to improve the relevance of recommended items. To evaluated RecGAN using two datasets on food and movie recommendation. Results indicate that our model outperforms other baseline models irrespective of user behavior and density of training data.</p>

    <h3>Superhighway: Bypass Data Sparsity in Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ting-Hsiang Wang, Ming-Feng Tsai, Yian Chen, Kwei-Herng Lai, Heng-Yu Chi, Chuan-Ju Wang</p>
    <p>Cross-domain collaborative filtering (CF) aims to alleviate data sparsity in single-domain CF by leveraging knowledge transferred from related domains. Many traditional methods focus on enriching compared neighborhood relations in CF directly to address the sparsity problem. In this paper, we propose superhighway construction, an alternative explicit relation-enrichment procedure, to improve recommendations by enhancing cross-domain connectivity. Specifically, assuming partially overlapped items (users), superhighway bypasses multi-hop inter-domain paths between cross-domain users (items, respectively) with direct paths to enrich the cross-domain connectivity. The experiments conducted on a real-world cross-region music dataset and a cross-platform movie dataset show that the proposed superhighway construction significantly improves recommendation performance in both target and source domains.</p>

    <h3>Accuracy and Diversity in Cross-domain Recommendations for Cold-start Users with Positive-only Feedback (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tommaso Di Noia, Eugenio Di Sciascio, Paolo Tomeo, Ignacio Fernández-Tobías, Iván Cantador</p>
    <p>Computing useful recommendations for cold-start users is a major challenge in the design of recommender systems, and additional data is often required to compensate the scarcity of user feedback. In this paper we address such problem in a target domain by exploiting user preferences from a related auxiliary domain. Following a rigorous methodology for cold-start, we evaluate a number of recommendation methods on a dataset with positive-only feedback in the movie and music domains, both in single and cross-domain scenarios. Comparing the methods in terms of item ranking accuracy, diversity and catalog coverage, we show that cross-domain preference data is useful to provide more accurate suggestions when user feedback in the target domain is scarce or not available at all, and may lead to more diverse recommendations depending on the target domain. Moreover, evaluating the impact of the user profile size and diversity in the source domain, we show that, in general, the quality of target recommendations increases with the size of the profile, but may deteriorate with too diverse profiles.</p>
