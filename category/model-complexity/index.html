    <h3>Investigating Overparameterization for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization in Collaborative Filtering (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhi Kawakami, Mahito Sugiyama</p>
    <p>Overparameterization is one of the key techniques in modern machine learning, where a model with the higher complexity can generalize better on test data against the common knowledge of the bias-variance trade-off in classical statistical learning theory. In this paper, we empirically investigate the effect of overparameterization for matrix factorization-based models in collaborative filtering. Surprisingly, we firstly show that the performance of overparameterized non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on test data gets better than that of the underparameterized NMF, which is commonly used to date, and is even competitive with the state-of-the-art collaborative filtering techniques. Moreover, we also show that the double descent phenomenon occurs when we increase the number of parameters of the NMF, where the test error decreases, increases, and decreases again as the model complexity grows, which has been recently reported in various machine learning methods such as deep learning models and kernel methods.</p>

    <h3>Sparse Feature Factorization for Recommender Systems with Knowledge Graphs (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonio Ferrara, Alberto Carlo Maria Mancino, Vito Walter Anelli, Tommaso Di Noia</p>
    <p>Deep Learning and factorization-based collaborative filtering recommendation models have undoubtedly dominated the scene of recommender systems in recent years. However, despite their outstanding performance, these methods require a training time proportional to the size of the embeddings and it further increases when also side information is considered for the computation of the recommendation list. In fact, in these cases we have that with a large number of high-quality features, the resulting models are more complex and difficult to train. This paper addresses this problem by presenting KGFlex: a sparse factorization approach that grants an even greater degree of expressiveness. To achieve this result, KGFlex analyzes the historical data to understand the dimensions the user decisions depend on (e.g., movie direction, musical genre, nationality of book writer). KGFlex represents each item feature as an embedding and it models user-item interactions as a factorized entropy-driven combination of the item attributes relevant to the user. KGFlex facilitates the training process by letting users update only those relevant features on which they base their decisions. In other words, the user-item prediction is mediated by the user’s personal view that considers only relevant features. An extensive experimental evaluation shows the approach’s effectiveness, considering the recommendation results’ accuracy, diversity, and induced bias. The public implementation of KGFlex is available at https://split.to/kgflex.</p>
