    <h3>AI-based Human-Centered Recommender Systems: Empirical Experiments and Research Infrastructure (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixuan Sun</p>
    <p>This is a dissertation plan built around human-centered empirical experiments evaluating recommender systems (RecSys). We see this as an important research theme since many AI-based RecSys algorithmic studies lack real human assessment. Therefore, we do not know how they work in the wild that only human experiments can tell us. We split this extended abstract into two parts — 1) A series of individual studies focusing on open questions about different human values or recommendation algorithms. Our completed works include user control over content diversity, user appreciation on DL-RecSys algorithms, and human-LLMRec interaction study. We also propose three future works to understand news recommendation depolarization, personalized news podcast, and interactive user representation; 2) An experimentation infrastructure named POPROX. As a personalized news recommendation platform, it aims to support the longitudinal study needs from the general AI and RecSys research community.</p>

    <h3>Large-Scale Modeling of Mobile User Click Behaviors Using Deep Learning (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Li, Xin Zhou</p>
    <p>Modeling tap or click sequences of users on a mobile device can improve our understandings of interaction behavior and offers opportunities for UI optimization by recommending next element the user might want to click on. We analyzed a large-scale dataset of over 20 million clicks from more than 4,000 mobile users who opted in. We then designed a deep learning model that predicts the next element that the user clicks given the user’s click history, the structural information of the UI screen, and the current context such as the time of the day. We thoroughly investigated the deep model by comparing it with a set of baseline methods based on the dataset. The experiments show that our model achieves 48% and 71% accuracy (top-1 and top-3) for predicting next clicks based on a held-out dataset of test users, which significantly outperformed all the baseline methods with a large margin. We discussed a few scenarios for integrating the model in mobile interaction and how users can potentially benefit from the model.</p>
