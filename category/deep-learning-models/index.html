    <h3>MLoRA: Multi-Domain Low-Rank Adaptive Network for CTR Prediction (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Libin Yang, Haining Gao, Wei Ning, Luwei Yang, Zhiming Yang, Dehong Gao, Guannan Zhang, Xiaoyan Cai</p>
    <p>Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is one of the fundamental tasks in the industry, especially in e-commerce, social media, and streaming media. It directly impacts website revenues, user satisfaction, and user retention. However, real-world production platforms often encompass various domains to cater for diverse customer needs. Traditional CTR prediction models struggle in multi-domain recommendation scenarios, facing challenges of data sparsity and disparate data distributions across domains. Existing multi-domain recommendation approaches introduce specific-domain modules for each domain, which partially address these issues but often significantly increase model parameters and lead to insufficient training. In this paper, we propose a Multi-domain Low-Rank Adaptive network (MLoRA) for CTR prediction, where we introduce a specialized LoRA module for each domain. This approach enhances the model’s performance in multi-domain CTR prediction tasks and is able to be applied to various deep-learning models. We evaluate the proposed method on several multi-domain datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our MLoRA approach achieves a significant improvement compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we deploy it in a real-world e-commerce production website. The online A/B testing results indicate the superiority and flexibility in real-world production environments.</p>

    <h3>A Model-Agnostic Framework for Recommendation via Interest-aware Item Embeddings (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Xiong, Amit Kumar Jaiswal</p>
    <p>Item representation holds significant importance in recommendation systems, which encompasses domains such as news, retail, and videos. Retrieval and ranking models utilise item representation to capture the user-item relationship based on user behaviours. While existing representation learning methods primarily focus on optimising item-based mechanisms, such as attention and sequential modelling. However, these methods lack a modelling mechanism to directly reflect user interests within the learned item representations. Consequently, these methods may be less effective in capturing user interests indirectly. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Interest-aware Capsule network (IaCN) recommendation model, a model-agnostic framework that directly learns interest-oriented item representations. IaCN serves as an auxiliary task, enabling the joint learning of both item-based and interest-based representations. This framework adopts existing recommendation models without requiring substantial redesign. We evaluate the proposed approach on benchmark datasets, exploring various scenarios involving different deep neural networks, behaviour sequence lengths, and joint learning ratios of interest-oriented item representations. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance enhancements across diverse recommendation models, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

    <h3>Large-Scale Modeling of Mobile User Click Behaviors Using Deep Learning (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Li, Xin Zhou</p>
    <p>Modeling tap or click sequences of users on a mobile device can improve our understandings of interaction behavior and offers opportunities for UI optimization by recommending next element the user might want to click on. We analyzed a large-scale dataset of over 20 million clicks from more than 4,000 mobile users who opted in. We then designed a deep learning model that predicts the next element that the user clicks given the user’s click history, the structural information of the UI screen, and the current context such as the time of the day. We thoroughly investigated the deep model by comparing it with a set of baseline methods based on the dataset. The experiments show that our model achieves 48% and 71% accuracy (top-1 and top-3) for predicting next clicks based on a held-out dataset of test users, which significantly outperformed all the baseline methods with a large margin. We discussed a few scenarios for integrating the model in mobile interaction and how users can potentially benefit from the model.</p>

    <h3>Generation-based vs. Retrieval-based Conversational Recommendation: A User-Centric Comparison (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Ahtsham Manzoor</p>
    <p>In the past few years we observed a renewed interest in conversational recommender systems (CRS) that interact with users in natural language. Most recent research efforts use neural models trained on recorded recommendation dialogs between humans, supporting an end-to-end learning process. Given the user’s utterances in a dialog, these systems aim to generate appropriate responses in natural language based on the learned models. An alternative to such language generation approaches is to retrieve and possibly adapt suitable sentences from the recorded dialogs. Approaches of this latter type are explored only to a lesser extent in the current literature.<br>In this work, we revisit the potential value of retrieval-based approaches to conversational recommendation. To that purpose, we compare two recent deep learning models for response generation with a retrieval-based method that determines a set of response candidates using a nearest-neighbor technique and heuristically reranks them. We adopt a user-centric evaluation approach, where study participants (N=60) rated the responses of the three compared systems. We could reproduce the claimed improvement of one of the deep learning methods over the other. However, the retrieval-based system outperformed both language generation based approaches in terms of the perceived quality of the system responses. Overall, our study suggests that retrieval-based approaches should be considered as an alternative or complement to modern language generation-based approaches.</p>

    <h3>AutoRec: An Automated Recommender System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingquan Song, Xiaotian Han, Xia Hu, Zirui Liu, Haifeng Jin, Ting-Hsiang Wang</p>
    <p>Realistic recommender systems are often required to adapt to ever-changing data and tasks or to explore different models systematically. To address the need, we present AutoRec  1  2, an open-source automated machine learning (AutoML) platform extended from the TensorFlow [3] ecosystem and, to our knowledge, the first framework to leverage AutoML for model search and hyperparameter tuning in deep recommendation models. AutoRec also supports a highly flexible pipeline that accommodates both sparse and dense inputs, rating prediction and click-through rate (CTR) prediction tasks, and an array of recommendation models. Lastly, AutoRec provides a simple, user-friendly API. Experiments conducted on the benchmark datasets reveal AutoRec is reliable and can identify models which resemble the best model without prior knowledge.</p>

    <h3>Interpretable Contextual Team-aware Item Recommendation: Application in Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Games (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir Araujo, Denis Parra, Andrés Villa, Francisca Cattan</p>
    <p>The video game industry has adopted recommendation systems to boost users interest with a focus on game sales. Other exciting applications within video games are those that help the player make decisions that would maximize their playing experience, which is a desirable feature in real-time strategy video games such as Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) like as DotA and LoL. Among these tasks, the recommendation of items is challenging, given both the contextual nature of the game and how it exposes the dependence on the formation of each team. Existing works on this topic do not take advantage of all the available contextual match data and dismiss potentially valuable information. To address this problem we develop TTIR, a contextual recommender model derived from the Transformer neural architecture that suggests a set of items to every team member, based on the contexts of teams and roles that describe the match. TTIR outperforms several approaches and provides interpretable recommendations through visualization of attention weights. Our evaluation indicates that both the Transformer architecture and the contextual information are essential to get the best results for this item recommendation task. Furthermore, a preliminary user survey indicates the usefulness of attention weights for explaining recommendations as well as ideas for future work. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ojedaf/IC-TIR-Lol .</p>
