    <h3>Interface Design to Mitigate Inflation in Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rana Shahout, Nikhil Garg, Sasha Stoikov, Yehonatan Peisakhovsky</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems rely on user-provided data to learn about item quality and provide personalized recommendations. An implicit assumption when aggregating ratings into item quality is that ratings are strong indicators of item quality. In this work, we analyze this assumption using data collected from a music discovery application. Our study focuses on two factors that cause rating inflation: heterogeneous user rating behavior and the dynamics of personalized recommendations. We show that user rating behavior is significantly variable, leading to item quality estimates that reflect the users who rated an item more than the item quality itself. Additionally, items that are more likely to be shown via personalized recommendations can experience a substantial increase in their exposure and potential bias toward them. To mitigate these effects, we conducted a randomized controlled trial where the rating interface was modified. This resulted in a substantial improvement in user rating behavior and a reduction in item quality inflation. These findings highlight the importance of carefully considering the assumptions underlying recommendation systems and designing interfaces that encourage accurate rating behavior.</p>

    <h3>Off-Policy Actor Critic for Recommender Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minmin Chen, Can Xu, Aviral Kumar, Ed Chi, Vince Gatto, Devanshu Jain</p>
    <p>Industrial recommendation platforms are increasingly concerned with how to make recommendations that cause users to enjoy their long term experience on the platform. Reinforcement learning emerged naturally as an appealing approach for its promise in 1) combating feedback loop effect resulted from myopic system behaviors; and 2) sequential planning to optimize long term outcome. Scaling RL algorithms to production recommender systems serving billions of users and contents, however remain challenging. Sample inefficiency and instability of online RL hinder its widespread adoption in production. Offline RL enables usage of off-policy data and batch learning. It on the other hand faces significant challenges in learning due to the distribution shift.<br>A REINFORCE agent [3] was successfully tested for YouTube recommendation, significantly outperforming a sophisticated supervised learning production system. Off-policy correction was employed to learn from logged data. The algorithm partially mitigates the distribution shift by employing a one-step importance weighting. We resort to the off-policy actor critic algorithms to addresses the distribution shift to a better extent. Here we share the key designs in setting up an off-policy actor-critic agent for production recommender systems. It extends  [3] with a critic network that estimates the value of any state-action pairs under the target learned policy through temporal difference learning. We demonstrate in offline and live experiments that the new framework out-performs baseline and improves long term user experience.<br>An interesting discovery along our investigation is that recommendation agents that employ a softmax policy parameterization, can end up being too pessimistic about out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Finding the right balance between pessimism and optimism on OOD actions is critical to the success of offline RL for recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Investigating Overparameterization for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization in Collaborative Filtering (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhi Kawakami, Mahito Sugiyama</p>
    <p>Overparameterization is one of the key techniques in modern machine learning, where a model with the higher complexity can generalize better on test data against the common knowledge of the bias-variance trade-off in classical statistical learning theory. In this paper, we empirically investigate the effect of overparameterization for matrix factorization-based models in collaborative filtering. Surprisingly, we firstly show that the performance of overparameterized non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on test data gets better than that of the underparameterized NMF, which is commonly used to date, and is even competitive with the state-of-the-art collaborative filtering techniques. Moreover, we also show that the double descent phenomenon occurs when we increase the number of parameters of the NMF, where the test error decreases, increases, and decreases again as the model complexity grows, which has been recently reported in various machine learning methods such as deep learning models and kernel methods.</p>

    <h3>ADER: Adaptively Distilled Exemplar Replay Towards Continual Learning for Session-based Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyu Lin, Boi Faltings, Fei Mi</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendation has received growing attention recently due to the increasing privacy concern. Despite the recent success of neural session-based recommenders, they are typically developed in an offline manner using a static dataset. However, recommendation requires continual adaptation to take into account new and obsolete items and users, and requires “continual learning” in real-life applications. In this case, the recommender is updated continually and periodically with new data that arrives in each update cycle, and the updated model needs to provide recommendations for user activities before the next model update. A major challenge for continual learning with neural models is catastrophic forgetting, in which a continually trained model forgets user preference patterns it has learned before. To deal with this challenge, we propose a method called Adaptively Distilled Exemplar Replay (ADER) by periodically replaying previous training samples (i.e., exemplars) to the current model with an adaptive distillation loss. Experiments are conducted based on the state-of-the-art SASRec model using two widely used datasets to benchmark ADER with several well-known continual learning techniques. We empirically demonstrate that ADER consistently outperforms other baselines, and it even outperforms the method using all historical data at every update cycle. This result reveals that ADER is a promising solution to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting issue towards building more realistic and scalable session-based recommenders.</p>

    <h3>Do Channels Matter?: Illuminating Interpersonal Influence on Music Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minju Park, So Yeon Park, Kyogu Lee, Hyun Jeong Kim</p>
    <p>Researchers and service providers have focused on leveraging social information acquired from interactions between users to improve the accuracy of system recommendations. However, few have explained the characteristics of music recommendations through interpersonal relationships. To investigate how interpersonal relationships affect users’ evaluation of music recommendation, we conducted a survey-based study that compared two types of recommendation channels—interpersonal (i.e., from friends) and non-interpersonal (i.e., from systems). We found that relevance was evaluated higher in music recommended from non-interpersonal channels on average, while diversity, novelty, and serendipity were higher in interpersonal channels. Non-interpersonal channels surpassed interpersonal channels in terms of convenience, frequency, and adoption rate. These results illustrate that interpersonal and non-interpersonal channels have different strengths and that digital streaming platforms, which have mainly provided system recommendations thus far, need to better support interpersonal channels for richer user experience.</p>

    <h3>Offline Contextual Multi-armed Bandits for Mobile Health Interventions: A Case Study on Emotion Regulation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bethany Teachman, Laura E Barnes, Miranda L. Beltzer, Lihua Cai, Mehdi Boukhechba, Mawulolo Koku Ameko</p>
    <p>Delivering treatment recommendations via pervasive electronic devices such as mobile phones has the potential to be a viable and scalable treatment medium for long-term health behavior management. But active experimentation of treatment options can be time-consuming, expensive and altogether unethical in some cases. There is a growing interest in methodological approaches that allow an experimenter to learn and evaluate the usefulness of a new treatment strategy before deployment. We present the first development of a treatment recommender system for emotion regulation using real-world historical mobile digital data from n = 114 high socially anxious participants to test the usefulness of new emotion regulation strategies. We explore a number of offline contextual bandits estimators for learning and propose a general framework for learning algorithms. Our experimentation shows that the proposed doubly robust offline learning algorithms performed significantly better than baseline approaches, suggesting that this type of recommender algorithm could improve emotion regulation. Given that emotion regulation is impaired across many mental illnesses and such a recommender algorithm could be scaled up easily, this approach holds potential to increase access to treatment for many people. We also share some insights that allow us to translate contextual bandit models to this complex real-world data, including which contextual features appear to be most important for predicting emotion regulation strategy effectiveness.</p>

    <h3>Modeling the Assimilation-Contrast Effects in Online Product Rating Systems: Debiasing and Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junzhou Zhao, Xiaoying Zhang, John C.S. Lui</p>
    <p>The unbiasedness of online product ratings, an important property to ensure that users’ ratings indeed reflect their true evaluations to products, is vital both in shaping consumer purchase decisions and providing reliable recommendations. Recent experimental studies showed that distortions from historical ratings would ruin the unbiasedness of subsequent ratings. How to “discover” the distortions from historical ratings in each single rating (or at the micro-level), and perform the “de-biasing operations” in real rating systems are the main objectives of this work. Using 42 million real customer ratings, we first show that users either “assimilate” or “contrast” to historical ratings under different scenarios: users conform to historical ratings if historical ratings are not far from the product quality (assimilation), while users deviate from historical ratings if they are significantly different from the product quality (contrast). This phenomenon can be explained by the well-known psychological argument: the “Assimilate-Contrast” theory. However, none of the existing works on modeling historical ratings’ influence have taken this into account, and this motivates us to propose the Historical Influence Aware Latent Factor Model (HIALF), the first model for real rating systems to capture and mitigate historical distortions in each single rating. HIALF also allows us to study the influence patterns of historical ratings from a modeling perspective, and it perfectly matches the assimilation and contrast effects we previously observed. Also, HIALF achieves significant improvements in predicting subsequent ratings, and accurately predicts the relationships revealed in previous empirical measurements on real ratings. Finally, we show that HIALF can contribute to better recommendations by decoupling users’ real preference from distorted ratings, and reveal the intrinsic product quality for wiser consumer purchase decisions.</p>

    <h3>Geographical Diversification in POI Recommendation: Toward Improved Coverage on Interested Areas (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jungkyu Han, Hayato Yamana</p>
    <p>In recommending POIs, the accuracy is important. However, merely accurate recommendations are useless in real life. Thus, beyond accuracy – such as the diversity of the recommended POIs – is as important as accuracy for a good recommendation. Although existing diversification methods can help POI recommender systems recommend more diverse POIs, they lack “geographical diversification” that results in concentration of “diverse” recommended POIs on “a small portion” of the most active areas of the target-user. This is caused by the neglect of POI locations in the diversification i.e., existing diversification methods try to diversify the categories of recommended items (POIs). However, geographical diversification is indispensable for the user whose activity district consists of many sub-areas and who requires variety of recommended POIs over his/her activity sub-areas. In this paper, we propose a novel proportional geographical diversification method to recommend variety of POIs located in his/her activity district but variety of sub-areas in the district proportional to the frequency of his/her activity to each sub-area. We compared our proposed method with existing diversification methods with real datasets. The evaluation result shows that no methods except for our proposed method can significantly increase geographical diversity at the expense of tolerable accuracy loss.</p>

    <h3>Image Discovery and Insertion for Custom Publishing (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerry Liu, Shanchan Wu, Lei Liu</p>
    <p>Images in reading materials make the content come alive. Aside from providing additional information to the text, reading material containing illustration engages our spatial memory, increases memory retention of the material. However, despite the plethora of available multimedia, adding illustrations to text continues to be a difficult task for the amateur content publisher. To address this problem, we present a semantic-aware image discovery and insertion system for custom publishing. Compared to image search engines, our system has the advantage of being able to discern among different topics within a long text passage and recommend the most relevant images for each detected topic with semantic “visual words” based relevance.</p>
