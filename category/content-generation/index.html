    <h3>LLMs for User Interest Exploration: A Hybrid Approach (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> He Ma, Haokai Lu, Yueqi Wang, Yifan Liu, Ed H. Chi, Lexi Baugher, Ningren Han, Shuzhou Zhang, Yang Gu, Jianling Wang, Minmin Chen, Shuchao Bi</p>
    <p>Traditional recommendation systems are subject to a strong feedback loop by learning from and reinforcing past user-item interactions, which in turn limits the discovery of novel user interests. To address this, we introduce a hybrid hierarchical framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and classic recommendation models for user interest exploration. The framework controls the interfacing between the LLMs and the classic recommendation models through “interest clusters”, the granularity of which can be explicitly determined by algorithm designers. It recommends the next novel interests by first representing “interest clusters” using language, and employs a fine-tuned LLM to generate novel interest descriptions that are strictly within these predefined clusters. At the low level, it grounds these generated interests to an item-level policy by restricting classic recommendation models, in this case a transformer-based sequence recommender to return items that fall within the novel clusters generated at the high level. We showcase the efficacy of this approach on an industrial-scale commercial platform serving billions of users. Live experiments show a significant increase in both exploration of novel interests and overall user enjoyment of the platform.</p>

    <h3>Co-optimize Content Generation and Consumption in a Large Scale Video Recommendation System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuening Li, Mingyan Gao, Qingyun Liu, Sourabh Bansod, Shuchao Bi, Liang Liu, Yaping Zhang, Zhen Zhang</p>
    <p>Multi-task prediction models and value models are the de-facto standard ranking components in modern large-scale content recommendation systems. However, they are typically optimized to model users’ passive consumption behaviors, and rank content in a way to grow only consumption-centric values. In this talk, we discuss the key insight that it is possible to model sparse participatory content-generation actions as well and grow ecosystem value through a new ranking system. We made the following key technical contributions in this system: (1) introducing ranking for content generation based on a categorization of user participation actions of different sparsity, including proxy intent action or access point clicks. (2) improving sparse task prediction quality and stability by causal task relationship modeling, conditional loss modeling and ResNet based shared bottom network. (3) personalizing the value model to minimize conflicts between different values, through e.g. ranking inspiring content higher for users who actively generate content. (4) conducting systematic evaluation of proposed approach in a large short-form video UGC (User-Generated Content) platform.</p>

    <h3>LLM Based Generation of Item-Description for Recommendation System (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brijraj Singh, Naoyuki Onoe, Arkadeep Acharya</p>
    <p>The description of an item plays a pivotal role in providing concise and informative summaries to captivate potential viewers and is essential for recommendation systems. Traditionally, such descriptions were obtained through manual web scraping techniques, which are time-consuming and susceptible to data inconsistencies. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, and open source LLMs like Alpaca have emerged as powerful tools for natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we have explored how we can use LLMs to generate detailed descriptions of the items. To conduct the study, we have used the MovieLens 1M dataset comprising movie titles and the Goodreads Dataset consisting of names of books and subsequently, an open-sourced LLM, Alpaca, was prompted with few-shot prompting on this dataset to generate detailed movie descriptions considering multiple features like the names of the cast and directors for the ML dataset and the names of the author and publisher for the Goodreads dataset. The generated description was then compared with the scraped descriptions using a combination of Top Hits, MRR, and NDCG as evaluation metrics. The results demonstrated that LLM-based movie description generation exhibits significant promise, with results comparable to the ones obtained by web-scraped descriptions.</p>
