    <h3>SeCor: Aligning Semantic and Collaborative representations by Large Language Models for Next-Point-of-Interest Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling Ding, Yang Xiang, Jianting Chen, Shirui Wang, Xiaoying Gao, Bohan Xie</p>
    <p>The widespread adoption of location-based applications has created a growing demand for point-of-interest (POI) recommendation, which aims to predict a user’s next POI based on their historical check-in data and current location. However, existing methods often struggle to capture the intricate relationships within check-in data. This is largely due to their limitations in representing temporal and spatial information and underutilizing rich semantic features. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful semantic comprehension to solve them, they are limited by hallucination and the inability to incorporate global collaborative information. To address these issues, we propose a novel method SeCor, which treats POI recommendation as a multi-modal task and integrates semantic and collaborative representations to form an efficient hybrid encoding. SeCor first employs a basic collaborative filtering model to mine interaction features. These embeddings, as one modal information, are fed into LLM to align with semantic representation, leading to efficient hybrid embeddings. To mitigate the hallucination, SeCor recommends based on the hybrid embeddings rather than directly using the LLM’s output text. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that SeCor outperforms all baselines, achieving improved recommendation performance by effectively integrating collaborative and semantic information through LLMs.</p>

    <h3>Challenges in Translating Research to Practice for Evaluating Fairness and Bias in Recommendation Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan Taber, Lex Beattie, Henriette Cramer</p>
    <p>Calls to action to implement evaluation of fairness and bias into industry systems are increasing at a rapid rate. The research community has attempted to meet these demands by producing ethical principles and guidelines for AI, but few of these documents provide guidance on how to implement these principles in real world settings. Without readily available standardized and practice-tested approaches for evaluating fairness in recommendation systems, industry practitioners, who are often not experts, may easily run into challenges or implement metrics that are potentially poorly suited to their specific applications. When evaluating recommendations, practitioners are well aware they should evaluate their systems for unintended algorithmic harms, but the most important, and unanswered question, is how? In this talk, we will present practical challenges we encountered in addressing algorithmic responsibility in recommendation systems, which also present research opportunities for the RecSys community. This talk will focus on the steps that need to happen before bias mitigation can even begin.</p>
