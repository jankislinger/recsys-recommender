    <h3>Explore versus repeat: insights from an online supermarket (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariagiorgia Agnese Tandoi, Daniela Solis Morales</p>
    <p>At online supermarket Picnic, we implemented both traditional collaborative filtering and a hybrid method to provide recipe recommendations at scale. This case study presents findings from the online evaluation of these algorithms, focusing on the repeat-explore trade-off. Our findings allow other online retailers to gain insights into the importance of thoughtful model design in navigating this important balance. We argue that even when exploiting known preferences proves highly beneficial in the short term, prioritizing exploratory content is essential for long-term customer satisfaction and sustained growth. Our research lays the groundwork for a compelling discussion on defining success in balancing the familiar and the novel in online grocery shopping.</p>

    <h3>A Lightweight Transformer for Next-Item Product Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey Mei, Yasaman Khazaeni, Cole Zuber</p>
    <p>We apply a transformer using sequential browse history to generate next-item product recommendations. Interpreting the learned item embeddings, we show that the model is able to implicitly learn price, popularity, style and functionality attributes without being explicitly passed these features during training. Our real-life test of this model on Wayfairâ€™s different international stores show mixed results (but overall win). Diagnosing the cause, we identify a useful metric (average number of customers browsing each product) to ensure good model convergence. We also find limitations of using standard metrics like recall and nDCG, which do not correctly account for the positional effects of showing items on the Wayfair website, and empirically determine a more accurate discount factor.</p>

    <h3>Practical Lessons from Developing a Large-Scale Recommender System at Zalando (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonino Freno</p>
    <p>Developing a real-world recommender system, i.e. for use in large-scale online retail, poses a number of different challenges. Interestingly, only a small part of these challenges are of algorithmic nature, such as how to select the most accurate model for a given use case. Instead, most technical problems usually arise from operational constraints, such as: adaptation to novel use cases; cost and complexity of system maintenance; capability of reusing pre-existing signal and integrating heterogeneous data sources. In this paper, we describe the system we developed in order to address those constraints at Zalando, which is one of the most popular online fashion retailers in Europe. In particular, we explain how moving from a collaborative filtering approach to a learning-to-rank model helped us to effectively tackle the challenges mentioned above, while improving at the same time the quality of our recommendations. A fairly detailed description of our software architecture is provided, along with an overview of the algorithmic approach. On the other hand, we present some of the offline and online experiments that we ran in order to validate our models.</p>
