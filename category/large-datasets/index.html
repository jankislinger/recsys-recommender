    <h3>Modeling the Assimilation-Contrast Effects in Online Product Rating Systems: Debiasing and Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junzhou Zhao, Xiaoying Zhang, John C.S. Lui</p>
    <p>The unbiasedness of online product ratings, an important property to ensure that users’ ratings indeed reflect their true evaluations to products, is vital both in shaping consumer purchase decisions and providing reliable recommendations. Recent experimental studies showed that distortions from historical ratings would ruin the unbiasedness of subsequent ratings. How to “discover” the distortions from historical ratings in each single rating (or at the micro-level), and perform the “de-biasing operations” in real rating systems are the main objectives of this work. Using 42 million real customer ratings, we first show that users either “assimilate” or “contrast” to historical ratings under different scenarios: users conform to historical ratings if historical ratings are not far from the product quality (assimilation), while users deviate from historical ratings if they are significantly different from the product quality (contrast). This phenomenon can be explained by the well-known psychological argument: the “Assimilate-Contrast” theory. However, none of the existing works on modeling historical ratings’ influence have taken this into account, and this motivates us to propose the Historical Influence Aware Latent Factor Model (HIALF), the first model for real rating systems to capture and mitigate historical distortions in each single rating. HIALF also allows us to study the influence patterns of historical ratings from a modeling perspective, and it perfectly matches the assimilation and contrast effects we previously observed. Also, HIALF achieves significant improvements in predicting subsequent ratings, and accurately predicts the relationships revealed in previous empirical measurements on real ratings. Finally, we show that HIALF can contribute to better recommendations by decoupling users’ real preference from distorted ratings, and reveal the intrinsic product quality for wiser consumer purchase decisions.</p>

    <h3>Cold-start News Recommendation with Domain-dependent Browse Graph (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Trevisiol, Rossano Schifanella, Luca Maria Aiello, Alejandro Jaimes</p>
    <p>Online social networks and mash-up services create opportunities to connect different web services otherwise isolated. Specifically in the case of news, users are very much exposed to news articles while performing other activities, such as social networking or web searching. Browsing behaviour aimed to the consumption of news, especially in relation to the visits coming from other domains, has been mainly overlooked in previous work. To address that, we build a BrowseGraph out of the collective browsing traces extracted from a large viewlog of Yahoo News (0.5B entries) and we define the ReferrerGraph as its subgraph induced by the sessions with the same referrer domain. The structural and temporal properties of the graph show that browsing behavior in news is highly dependent on the referrer URL of the session, in terms of type of content consumed and time of consumption. We build on this observation and propose a news recommender that addresses the cold-start problem: given a user landing on a page of the site for the first time, we aim to predict the page she will visit next. We compare 24 flavors of recommenders belonging to the families of content-based, popularity-based, and browsing-based models. We show that the browsing-based recommender that take into account the referrer URL is the best performing, achieving a prediction accuracy of 61% in conditions of heavy data sparsity.</p>
