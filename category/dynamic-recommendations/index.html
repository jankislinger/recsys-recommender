    <h3>Learning Dynamic Insurance Recommendations from Users’ Click Sessions (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Borg Bruun</p>
    <p>While personalised recommendations have been most successful in domains like retail due to large volume of users’ feedback on items, it is challenging to implement traditional recommender systems into the insurance domain where such prior information is very small in volume. This work addresses the problem of sparse feedback by studying users’ click sessions as signals for learning insurance recommendations. Our preliminary results show limitations in representing click sessions by manually engineered features. The proposed framework uses an autoencoder approach to automatically learns representation of sessions, then a neural network approach to model dependencies across sessions that can be used to predict recommendations. Thereby, it is further able to capture users’ dynamic needs of insurance products evolving over time.</p>

    <h3>Online Learning to Rank for Sequential Music Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Ueda, Nivio Ziviani, Bruno L. Pereira, Gustavo Penha, Rodrygo L. T. Santos</p>
    <p>The prominent success of music streaming services has brought increasingly complex challenges for music recommendation. In particular, in a streaming setting, songs are consumed sequentially within a listening session, which should cater not only for the user’s historical preferences, but also for eventual preference drifts, triggered by a sudden change in the user’s context. In this paper, we propose a novel online learning to rank approach for music recommendation aimed to continuously learn from the user’s listening feedback. In contrast to existing online learning approaches for music recommendation, we leverage implicit feedback as the only signal of the user’s preference. Moreover, to adapt rapidly to preference drifts over millions of songs, we represent each song in a lower dimensional feature space and explore multiple directions in this space as duels of candidate recommendation models. Our thorough evaluation using listening sessions from Last.fm demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach at learning faster and better compared to state-of-the-art online learning approaches.</p>

    <h3>Human-Recommender Systems: From Benchmark Data to Benchmark Cognitive Models (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Shafto, Olfa Nasraoui</p>
    <p>We bring to the fore of the recommender system research community, an inconvenient truth about the current state of understanding how recommender system algorithms and humans influence one another, both computationally and cognitively. Unlike the great variety of supervised machine learning algorithms which traditionally rely on expert input labels and are typically used for decision making by an expert, recommender systems specifically rely on data input from non-expert or casual users and are meant to be used directly by these same non-expert users on an every day basis. Furthermore, the advances in online machine learning, data generation, and predictive model learning have become increasingly interdependent, such that each one feeds on the other in an iterative cycle. Research in psychology suggests that people’s choices are (1) contextually dependent, and (2) dependent on interaction history. Thus, while standard methods of training and assessing performance of recommender systems rely on benchmark datasets, we suggest that a critical step in the evolution of recommender systems is the development of benchmark of human behavior that capture contextual and dynamic aspects of human behavior. It is important to emphasize that even extensive real life user-tests may not be sufficient to make up for this gap in benchmarking validity because user tests are typically done with either a focus on user satisfaction or engagement (clicks, sales, likes, etc) with whatever the recommender algorithm suggests to the user, and thus ignore the human cognitive aspect. We conclude by highlighting the interdisciplinary implications of this endeavor.</p>

    <h3>Towards a Dynamic Top-N Recommendation Framework (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Liu</p>
    <p>Real world large-scale recommender systems are always dynamic: new users and items continuously enter the system, and the status of old ones (e.g., users’ preference and items’ popularity) evolve over time. In order to handle such dynamics, we propose a recommendation framework consisting of an online component and an offline component, where the newly arrived items are processed by the online component such that users are able to get suggestions for fresh information, and the influence of longstanding items is captured by the offline component. Based on individual users’ past rating behavior, recommendations from the two components are combined to provide top-N recommendation. We formulate recommendation problem as a ranking problem where learning to rank is applied to extend upon a latent factor model to optimize recommendation rankings by minimizing a pairwise loss function. Furthermore, to more accurately model interactions between users and items, Latent Dirichlet Allocation is incorporated to fuse rating information and textual information. Real data based experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models by at least 61.21% and 50.27% in terms of mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) respectively.</p>
