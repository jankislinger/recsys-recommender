    <h3>Towards Sustainability-aware Recommender Systems: Analyzing the Trade-off Between Algorithms Performance and Carbon Footprint (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Semeraro, Giuseppe Spillo, Allegra De Filippo, Cataldo Musto, Michela Milano</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of the trade-off between the performance of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and their sustainability. In particular, we compared 18 popular recommendation algorithms in terms of both standard metrics (i.e., accuracy and diversity of the recommendations) as well as in terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint on three different datasets. In order to obtain a fair comparison, all the algorithms were run based on the implementations available in a popular recommendation library, i.e., RecBole, and used the same experimental settings. The outcomes of the experiments clearly showed that the choice of the optimal recommendation algorithm requires a thorough analysis, since more sophisticated algorithms often led to tiny improvements at the cost of an exponential increase of carbon emissions. Through this paper, we aim to shed light on the problem of carbon footprint and energy consumption of recommender systems, and we make the first step towards the development of sustainability-aware recommendation algorithms.</p>

    <h3>Are We Evaluating Rigorously? Benchmarking Recommendation for Reproducible Evaluation and Fair Comparison (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhu Sun, Jie Zhang, Di Yu, Xinghua Qu, Hui Fang, Jie Yang, Cong Geng</p>
    <p>With tremendous amount of recommendation algorithms proposed every year, one critical issue has attracted a considerable amount of attention: there are no effective benchmarks for evaluation, which leads to two major concerns, i.e., unreproducible evaluation and unfair comparison. This paper aims to conduct rigorous (i.e., reproducible and fair) evaluation for implicit-feedback based top-N recommendation algorithms. We first systematically review 85 recommendation papers published at eight top-tier conferences (e.g., RecSys, SIGIR) to summarize important evaluation factors, e.g., data splitting and parameter tuning strategies, etc. Through a holistic empirical study, the impacts of different factors on recommendation performance are then analyzed in-depth. Following that, we create benchmarks with standardized procedures and provide the performance of seven well-tuned state-of-the-arts across six metrics on six widely-used datasets as a reference for later study. Additionally, we release a user-friendly Python toolkit, which differs from existing ones in addressing the broad scope of rigorous evaluation for recommendation. Overall, our work sheds light on the issues in recommendation evaluation and lays the foundation for further investigation. Our code and datasets are available at GitHub (https://github.com/AmazingDD/daisyRec).</p>

    <h3>Data Mining for Item Recommendation in MOBA Games (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Parra, Felipe Rios, Vladimir Araujo</p>
    <p>E-Sports has been positioned as an important activity within  MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) games in recent years. There is existing research on recommender systems in this topic, but most of it focuses on the character recommendation problem. However, the recommendation of items is also challenging because of its contextual nature, depending on the other characters. We have developed a framework that suggests items for a character based on the match context. The system aims to help players who have recently started the game as well as frequent players to take strategic advantage during a match and to improve their purchasing decision making. By analyzing a dataset of ranked matches through data mining techniques, we can capture purchase dynamic of experienced players to use it to generate recommendations. The results show that our proposed solution yields up to 80% of mAP, suggesting that the method leverages context information successfully. These results, together with open issues we mention in the paper, call for further research in the area. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Latent Multi-Criteria Ratings for Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan Li, Alexander Tuzhilin</p>
    <p>Multi-Criteria Recommender systems have been increasingly valuable for helping the consumers identify the most relevant items with their multi-criteria feedback along different dimensions of user experiences. However, previous design of multi-criteria recommendation algorithms did not take into account user reviews. This is unfortunate because multi-criteria recommender systems suffer from the missing ratings problem and user reviews could be helpful for alleviating the missing ratings and sparsity problem, thus improving the quality of recommendations. Besides, it’s not clear from prior literature how to select the most important criteria to collect from users. In addition, previously proposed methods did not consider the latent semantic relations between users and items. To address these concerns, in this paper we propose a novel design of multi-criteria recommendation based on latent multi-criteria ratings generated from user reviews. In particular, we utilize variational autoencoders to map user reviews into latent embeddings, which are subsequently compressed into smaller dimensional discrete vectors using the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization technique. The resulting compressed vectors constitute latent multi-criteria ratings that we use for the recommendation purposes via standard multi-criteria recommendation methods. We show that the proposed latent multi-criteria rating approach outperforms several baselines significantly and consistently across different datasets and performance evaluation measures. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Quick and Accurate Attack Detection in Recommender Systems through User Attributes (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ismail Uysal, Yasin Yilmaz, Mehmet Aktukmak</p>
    <p>Malicious profiles have been a credible threat to collaborative recommender systems. Attackers provide fake item ratings to systematically manipulate the platform. Attack detection algorithms can identify and remove such users by observing rating distributions. In this study, we aim to use the user attributes as an additional information source to improve the accuracy and speed of attack detection. We propose a probabilistic factorization model which can embed mixed data type user attributes and observed ratings into a latent space to generate anomaly statistics for new users. To identify the persistent outliers in the system, we also propose a sequential attack detection algorithm to enable quick and accurate detection based on the probabilistic model learned from genuine users. The proposed model demonstrates significant improvements in both accuracy and speed when compared to baseline algorithms on a popular benchmark dataset.</p>

    <h3>Style Conditioned Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamelia Aryafar, Murium Iqbal, Timothy Anderton</p>
    <p>We propose Style Conditioned Recommendations (SCR) and introduce style injection as a method to diversify recommendations. We use Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) architecture, where both the encoder and decoder are conditioned on a user profile learned from item content data. This allows us to apply style transfer methodologies to the task of recommendations, which we refer to as injection. To enable style injection, user profiles are learned to be interpretable such that they express users’ propensities for specific predefined styles. These are learned via label-propagation from a dataset of item content, with limited labeled points. To perform injection, the condition on the encoder is learned while the condition on the decoder is selected per explicit feedback. Explicit feedback can be taken either from a user’s response to a style or interest quiz, or from item ratings. In the absence of explicit feedback, the condition at the encoder is applied to the decoder. We show a 12% improvement on NDCG@20 over the traditional VAE based approach on the task of recommendations. We show an average 22% improvement on AUC across all classes for predicting user style profiles against our best performing baseline. After injecting styles we compare the user style profile to the style of the recommendations and show that injected styles have an average +133% increase in presence. Our results show that style injection is a powerful method to diversify recommendations while maintaining personal relevance. Our main contribution is an application of a semi-supervised approach that extends item labels to interpretable user profiles.</p>

    <h3>Towards Large Scale Training Of AutoEncoders For Collaborative Filtering (2018)</h3>

    <h3>Metalearning for Context-aware Filtering: Selection of Tensor Factorization Algorithms (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiago Cunha, André C.P.L.F. de Carvalho, Carlos Soares</p>
    <p>This work addresses the problem of selecting Tensor Factorization algorithms for the Context-aware Filtering recommendation task using a metalearning approach. The most important challenge of applying metalearning on new problems is the development of useful measures able to characterize the data, i.e. metafeatures. We propose an extensive and exhaustive set of metafeatures to characterize Context-aware Filtering recommendation task. These metafeatures take advantage of the tensor’s hierarchical structure via slice operations. The algorithm selection task is addressed as a Label Ranking problem, which ranks the Tensor Factorization algorithms according to their expected performance, rather than simply selecting the algorithm that is expected to obtain the best performance. A comprehensive experimental work is conducted on both levels, baselevel and metalevel (Tensor Factorization and Label Ranking, respectively). The results show that the proposed metafeatures lead to metamodels that tend to rank Tensor Factorization algorithms accurately and that the selected algorithms present high recommendation performance.</p>

    <h3>Genre Prediction to Inform the Recommendation Process (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Soledad Pera, Nevena Dragovic</p>
    <p>In this paper we present a time-based genre prediction strategy that can inform the book recommendation process. To explicitly consider time in predicting genres of interest, we rely on a popular time series forecasting model as well as reading patterns of each individual reader or group of readers (in case of libraries or publishing companies). Based on a conducted initial assessment using the Amazon dataset, we demonstrate our strategy outperforms its baseline counterpart.</p>

    <h3>Recommending Fair Payments for Large-Scale Social Ridesharing (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georgios Chalkiadakis, Alessandro Farinelli, Filippo Bistaffa, Sarvapali D. Ramchurn</p>
    <p>We perform recommendations for the Social Ridesharing scenario, in which a set of commuters, connected through a social network, arrange one-time rides at short notice. In particular, we focus on how much one should pay for taking a ride with friends. More formally, we propose the first approach that can compute fair coalitional payments that are also stable according to the game-theoretic concept of the for systems with thousands of agents in real-world scenarios. Our tests, based on real datasets for both spatial (GeoLife) and social data (Twitter), show that our approach is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art (up to 84 times), allowing us to compute stable payments for 2000 agents in 50 minutes. We also develop a parallel version of our approach, which achieves a near-optimal speed-up in the number of processors used. Finally, our empirical analysis reveals new insights into the relationship between payments incurred by a user by virtue of its position in its social network and its role (rider or driver).</p>

    <h3>Evaluating Recommender Behavior For New Users (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Kluver, Joseph Konstan</p>
    <p>The new user experience is one of the important problems in recommender systems. Past work on recommending for new users has focused on the process of gathering information from the user. Our work focuses on how different algorithms behave for new users. We describe a methodology that we use to compare representatives of three common families of algorithms along eleven different metrics. We find that for the first few ratings a baseline algorithm performs better than three common collaborative filtering algorithms. Once we have a few ratings, we find that Funk’s SVD algorithm has the best overall performance. We also find that ItemItem, a very commonly deployed algorithm, performs very poorly for new users. Our results can inform the design of interfaces and algorithms for new users.</p>
