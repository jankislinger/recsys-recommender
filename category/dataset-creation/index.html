    <h3>Exploratory Analysis of Recommending Urban Parks for Health-Promoting Activities (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Quercia, Sanja Šćepanović, Ke Zhou, Linus W. Dietz</p>
    <p>Parks are essential spaces for promoting urban health, and recommender systems could assist individuals in discovering parks for leisure and health-promoting activities. This is particularly important in large cities like London, which has over 1,500 named parks, making it challenging to understand what each park offers. Due to the lack of datasets and the diverse health-promoting activities parks can support (e.g., physical, social, nature-appreciation), it is unclear which recommendation algorithms are best suited for this task. To explore the dynamics of recommending parks for specific activities, we created two datasets: one from a survey of over 250 London residents, and another by inferring visits from over 1 million geotagged Flickr images taken in London parks. Analyzing the geographic patterns of these visits revealed that recommending nearby parks is ineffective, suggesting that this recommendation task is distinct from Point of Interest recommendation. We then tested various recommendation models, identifying a significant popularity bias in the results. Additionally, we found that personalized models have advantages in recommending parks beyond the most popular ones. The data and findings from this study provide a foundation for future research on park recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Semi-Supervised Visual Representation Learning for Fashion Compatibility (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deepthi Sharma, Ambareesh Revanur, Vijay Kumar</p>
    <p>We consider the problem of complementary fashion prediction. Existing approaches focus on learning an embedding space where fashion items from different categories that are visually compatible are closer to each other. However, creating such labeled outfits is intensive and also not feasible to generate all possible outfit combinations, especially with large fashion catalogs. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach where we leverage large unlabeled fashion corpus to create pseudo positive and negative outfits on the fly during training. For each labeled outfit in a training batch, we obtain a pseudo-outfit by matching each item in the labeled outfit with unlabeled items. Additionally, we introduce consistency regularization to ensure that representation of the original images and their transformations are consistent to implicitly incorporate colour and other important attributes through self-supervision. We conduct extensive experiments on Polyvore, Polyvore-D and our newly created large-scale Fashion Outfits datasets, and show that our approach with only a fraction of labeled examples performs on-par with completely supervised methods.</p>
