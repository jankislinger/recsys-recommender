    <h3>Towards Self-Explaining Sequence-Aware Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Boratto, Alejandro Ariza-Casabona, Maria Salamo, Gianni Fenu</p>
    <p>Self-explaining models are becoming an important perk of recommender systems, as they help users understand the reason behind certain recommendations, which encourages them to interact more often with the platform. In order to personalize recommendations, modern recommender approaches make the model aware of the user behavior history for interest evolution representation. However, existing explainable recommender systems do not consider the past user history to further personalize the explanation based on the user interest fluctuation. In this work, we propose a SEQuence-Aware Explainable Recommendation model (SEQUER) that is able to leverage the sequence of user-item review interactions to generate better explanations while maintaining recommendation performance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposal on multiple recommendation scenarios. Our source code and preprocessed datasets are available at https://tinyurl.com/SEQUER-RECSYS23.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation on Live-Streaming Platforms: Dynamic Availability and Repeat Consumption (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karl Aberer, Jeremie Rappaz, Julian McAuley</p>
    <p>Live-streaming platforms broadcast user-generated video in real-time. Recommendation on these platforms shares similarities with traditional settings, such as a large volume of heterogeneous content and highly skewed interaction distributions. However, several challenges must be overcome to adapt recommendation algorithms to live-streaming platforms: first, content availability is dynamic which restricts users to choose from only a subset of items at any given time; during training and inference we must carefully handle this factor in order to properly account for such signals, where ‘non-interactions’ reflect availability as much as implicit preference. Streamers are also fundamentally different from ‘items’ in traditional settings: repeat consumption of specific channels plays a significant role, though the content itself is fundamentally ephemeral. In this work, we study recommendation in this setting of a dynamically evolving set of available items. We propose LiveRec, a self-attentive model that personalizes item ranking based on both historical interactions and current availability. We also show that carefully modelling repeat consumption plays a significant role in model performance. To validate our approach, and to inspire further research on this setting, we release a dataset containing 475M user interactions on Twitch over a 43-day period. We evaluate our approach on a recommendation task and show our method to outperform various strong baselines in ranking the currently available content.</p>
