    <h3>Human-Recommender Systems: From Benchmark Data to Benchmark Cognitive Models (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Shafto, Olfa Nasraoui</p>
    <p>We bring to the fore of the recommender system research community, an inconvenient truth about the current state of understanding how recommender system algorithms and humans influence one another, both computationally and cognitively. Unlike the great variety of supervised machine learning algorithms which traditionally rely on expert input labels and are typically used for decision making by an expert, recommender systems specifically rely on data input from non-expert or casual users and are meant to be used directly by these same non-expert users on an every day basis. Furthermore, the advances in online machine learning, data generation, and predictive model learning have become increasingly interdependent, such that each one feeds on the other in an iterative cycle. Research in psychology suggests that people’s choices are (1) contextually dependent, and (2) dependent on interaction history. Thus, while standard methods of training and assessing performance of recommender systems rely on benchmark datasets, we suggest that a critical step in the evolution of recommender systems is the development of benchmark of human behavior that capture contextual and dynamic aspects of human behavior. It is important to emphasize that even extensive real life user-tests may not be sufficient to make up for this gap in benchmarking validity because user tests are typically done with either a focus on user satisfaction or engagement (clicks, sales, likes, etc) with whatever the recommender algorithm suggests to the user, and thus ignore the human cognitive aspect. We conclude by highlighting the interdisciplinary implications of this endeavor.</p>

    <h3>Behaviorism is Not Enough (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martijn C Willemsen, Michael D Ekstrand</p>
    <p>Behaviorism is the currently-dominant paradigm for building and evaluating recommender systems. Both the operation and the evaluation of recommender system applications are most often driven by analyzing the behavior of users. In this paper, we argue that listening to what users say — about the items and recom-mendations they like, the control they wish to exert on the output, and the ways in which they perceive the system — and not just observing what they do will enable important developments in the future of recommender systems. We provide both philosophi-cal and pragmatic motivations for this idea, describe the various points in the recommendation and evaluation processes where explicit user input may be considered, and discuss benefits that may result from considered incorporation of user preferences at each of these points. In particular, we envision recommender applications that aim to support users’ better selves: helping them live the life that they desire to lead. For example, recommender-assisted behavior change requires algorithms to predict not what users choose or do now, inferable from behavioral data, but what they should choose or do in the future to become healthier, fitter, more sustainable, or culturally aware. We hope that our work will spur useful discussion and many new ideas for recommenders that empower their users.</p>
