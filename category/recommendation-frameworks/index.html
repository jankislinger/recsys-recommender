    <h3>A Pre-trained Zero-shot Sequential Recommendation Framework via Popularity Dynamics (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hari Sundaram, Junting Wang, Praneet Rathi</p>
    <p>This paper proposes a novel pre-trained framework for zero-shot cross-domain  sequential recommendation without auxiliary information. While using auxiliary information (e.g., item descriptions) seems promising for cross-domain transfer, a cross-domain adaptation of sequential recommenders can be challenging when the target domain differs from the source domain—item descriptions are in different languages; metadata modalities (e.g., audio, image, and text) differ across source and target domains. If we can learn universal item representations independent of the domain type (e.g., groceries, movies), we can achieve zero-shot cross-domain transfer without auxiliary information. Our critical insight is that user interaction sequences highlight shifting user preferences via the popularity dynamics of interacted items. We present a pre-trained sequential recommendation framework: PrepRec, which utilizes a novel popularity dynamics-aware transformer architecture. Through extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, we show that PrepRec, without any auxiliary information, can zero-shot adapt to new application domains and achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art sequential recommender models. In addition, we show that PrepRec complements existing sequential recommenders. With a simple post-hoc interpolation, PrepRec improves the performance of existing sequential recommenders on average by 11.8% in Recall@10 and 22% in NDCG@10. We provide an anonymized implementation of PrepRec at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PrepRec–128E/}.</p>

    <h3>Promoting Two-sided Fairness with Adaptive Weights for Providers and Customers in Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen, Lanling Xu, Sheng Chen, Zihan Lin, Jinpeng Wang</p>
    <p>At present, most recommender systems involve two stakeholders, providers and customers. Apart from maximizing the recommendation accuracy, the fairness issue for both sides should also be considered. However, there is a trade-off for multi-objective optimization problems, where optimizing one objective (e.g. provider-side fairness) may degrade the performance of others (e.g. accuracy). Most of previous studies try to improve two-sided fairness with post-processing algorithms or fairness-aware loss constraints, which are highly dependent on the heuristic adjustments without respect to the optimization goal of accuracy. In contrast, we propose a novel training framework, adaptive weighting  towards two-sided fairness-aware recommendation (named Ada2Fair), which lies in the extension of the accuracy-focused objective to a controllable preference learning loss over the interaction data. Specifically, we adjust the optimization scale of an interaction sample with an adaptive weight generator, and estimate the two-sided fairness-aware weights within model training. During the training process, the recommender is trained with two-sided fairness-aware weights to boost the utility of niche providers and inactive customers in a unified way. Extensive experiments on three public datasets verify the effectiveness of Ada2Fair, which can achieve Pareto improvements in two-sided fairness-aware recommendation. Our code implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Ada2Fair.</p>

    <h3>A Model-Agnostic Framework for Recommendation via Interest-aware Item Embeddings (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Xiong, Amit Kumar Jaiswal</p>
    <p>Item representation holds significant importance in recommendation systems, which encompasses domains such as news, retail, and videos. Retrieval and ranking models utilise item representation to capture the user-item relationship based on user behaviours. While existing representation learning methods primarily focus on optimising item-based mechanisms, such as attention and sequential modelling. However, these methods lack a modelling mechanism to directly reflect user interests within the learned item representations. Consequently, these methods may be less effective in capturing user interests indirectly. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Interest-aware Capsule network (IaCN) recommendation model, a model-agnostic framework that directly learns interest-oriented item representations. IaCN serves as an auxiliary task, enabling the joint learning of both item-based and interest-based representations. This framework adopts existing recommendation models without requiring substantial redesign. We evaluate the proposed approach on benchmark datasets, exploring various scenarios involving different deep neural networks, behaviour sequence lengths, and joint learning ratios of interest-oriented item representations. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance enhancements across diverse recommendation models, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

    <h3>Ex2Vec: Characterizing Users and Items from the Mere Exposure Effect (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Sguerra, Romain Hennequin</p>
    <p>The traditional recommendation framework seeks to connect user and content, by finding the best match possible based on users past interaction. However, a good content recommendation is not necessarily similar to what the user has chosen in the past. One limitation of basing future interaction on what happened in the past is that it ignores the fact that both sides of the problems are dynamic. As human, users naturally evolve, learn, forget, get bored, they change their perspective of the world and in consequence, of the recommendable content. In this work we present Ex2Vec our framework for accounting to the dynamic of the human side of the recommendation problem. We introduce the Mere Exposure Effect as a common phenomenon in music streaming platforms. We then present our model that leverage the effect for jointly characterizing users and music. We validate our model through predicting future music consumption based on repetition and discuss its implications.</p>

    <h3>Leveraging Post-click Feedback for Content Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongyi Wen, Longqi Yang, Deborah Estrin</p>
    <p>Implicit feedback (e.g., clicks) is widely used in content recommendations. However, clicks only reflect user preferences according to their first impressions. They do not capture the extent to which users continue to engage with the content. Our analysis shows that more than half of the clicks on music and short videos are followed by skips from two real-world datasets. In this paper, we leverage post-click feedback, e.g. skips and completions, to improve the training and evaluation of content recommenders. Specifically, we experiment with existing collaborative filtering algorithms and find that they perform poorly against post-click-aware ranking metrics. Based on these insights, we develop a generic probabilistic framework to fuse click and post-click signals. We show how our framework can be applied to improve pointwise and pairwise recommendation models. Our approach is shown to outperform existing methods by 18.3% and 2.5% respectively in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) on the short-video and music dataset. We discuss the effectiveness of our approach across content domains and trade-offs in weighting various user feedback signals.</p>

    <h3>Comparative Recommender System Evaluation: Benchmarking Recommendation Frameworks (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Said, Alejandro Bellogin</p>
    <p>Recommender systems research is often based on comparisons of predictive accuracy: the better the evaluation scores, the better the recommender. However, it is difficult to compare results from different recommender systems due to the many options in design and implementation of an evaluation strategy. Additionally, algorithm implementations can diverge from the standard formulation due to manual tuning and modifications that work better in some situations. In this work we compare common recommendation algorithms as implemented in three popular recommendation frameworks. To provide a fair comparison, we have complete control of the evaluation dimensions being benchmarked: dataset, data splitting, evaluation strategies, and metrics. We also include results using the internal evaluation mechanisms of these frameworks. Our analysis points to large differences in recommendation accuracy across frameworks and strategies, i.e. the same baselines may perform orders of magnitude better or worse across frameworks. Our results show the necessity of clear guidelines when reporting evaluation of recommender systems to ensure reproducibility and comparison of results.</p>
