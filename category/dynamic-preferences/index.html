    <h3>Learning Usersâ€™ Preferred Visual Styles in an Image Marketplace (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandra Sala, Raul Gomez Bruballa, Lauren Burnham-King</p>
    <p>Providing meaningful recommendations in a content marketplace is challenging due to the fact that users are not the final content consumers. Instead, most users are creatives whose interests, linked to the projects they work on, change rapidly and abruptly. To address the challenging task of recommending images to content creators, we design a RecSys that learns visual styles preferences transversal to the semantics of the projects users work on. We analyze the challenges of the task compared to content-based recommendations driven by semantics, propose an evaluation setup, and explain its applications in a global image marketplace.</p>

    <h3>Next-item Recommendations in Short Sessions (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Wang, Shengsheng Wang, Wenzhuo Song, Shoujin Wang</p>
    <p>The changing preferences of users towards items trigger the emergence of session-based recommender systems (SBRSs), which aim to model the dynamic preferences of users for next-item recommendations. However, most of the existing studies on SBRSs are based on long sessions only for recommendations, ignoring short sessions, though short sessions, in fact, account for a large proportion in most of the real-world datasets. As a result, the applicability of existing SBRSs solutions is greatly reduced. In a short session, quite limited contextual information is available, making the next-item recommendation very challenging. To this end, in this paper, inspired by the success of few-shot learning (FSL) in effectively learning a model with limited instances, we formulate the next-item recommendation as an FSL problem. Accordingly, following the basic idea of a representative approach for FSL, i.e., meta-learning, we devise an effective SBRS called INter-SEssion collaborativeRecommender neTwork (INSERT) for next-item recommendations in short sessions. With the carefully devised local module and global module, INSERT is able to learn an optimal preference representation of the current user in a given short session. In particular, in the global module, a similar session retrieval network (SSRN) is designed to find out the sessions similar to the current short session from the historical sessions of both the current user and other users, respectively. The obtained similar sessions are then utilized to complement and optimize the preference representation learned from the current short session by the local module for more accurate next-item recommendations in this short session. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed INSERT over the state-of-the-art SBRSs when making next-item recommendations in short sessions.</p>
