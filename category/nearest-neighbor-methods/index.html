    <h3>Latent Factor Models and Aggregation Operators for Collaborative Filtering in Reciprocal Recommender Systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Neve, Ivan Palomares</p>
    <p>Online dating platforms help to connect people who might potentially be a good match for each other. They have exerted a significant societal impact over the last decade, such that about one third of new relationships in the US are now started online, for instance. Recommender Systems are widely utilized in online platforms that connect people to people in e.g. online dating and recruitment sites. These recommender approaches are fundamentally different from traditional user-item approaches (such as those operating on movie and shopping sites), in that they must consider the interests of both parties jointly. Latent factor models have been notably successful in the area of user-item recommendation, however they have not been investigated within user-to-user domains as of yet. In this study, we present a novel method for reciprocal recommendation using latent factor models. We also provide a first analysis of the use of different preference aggregation strategies, thereby demonstrating that the aggregation function used to combine user preference scores has a significant impact on the outcome of the recommender system. Our evaluation results report significant improvements over previous nearest-neighbour and content-based methods for reciprocal recommendation, and show that the latent factor model can be used effectively on much larger datasets than previous state-of-the-art reciprocal recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>A Simple Multi-Armed Nearest-Neighbor Bandit for Interactive Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Sanz-Cruzado, Esther López, Pablo Castells</p>
    <p>The cyclic nature of the recommendation task is being increasingly taken into account in recommender systems research. In this line, framing interactive recommendation as a genuine reinforcement learning problem, multi-armed bandit approaches have been increasingly considered as a means to cope with the dual exploitation/exploration goal of recommendation. In this paper we develop a simple multi-armed bandit elaboration of neighbor-based collaborative filtering. The approach can be seen as a variant of the nearest-neighbors scheme, but endowed with a controlled stochastic exploration capability of the users’ neighborhood, by a parameter-free application of Thompson sampling. Our approach is based on a formal development and a reasonably simple design, whereby it aims to be easy to reproduce and further elaborate upon. We report experiments using datasets from different domains showing that neighbor-based bandits indeed achieve recommendation accuracy enhancements in the mid to long run. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>
