    <h3>Advancing Automation of Design Decisions in Recommender System Pipelines (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Vente</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have become essential in domains like streaming services, social media platforms, and e-commerce websites.  However, the development of a recommender system involves a complex pipeline with preprocessing, data splitting, algorithm and model selection, and postprocessing stages, requiring critical design decisions.  Every stage of the recommender systems pipeline requires design decisions that influence the performance of the recommender system. To ease design decisions, automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques have been adapted to the field of recommender systems, resulting in various AutoRecSys libraries.  Nevertheless, these libraries lack library independence and limit flexibility in integrating automation techniques from different sources. In response, our research aims to enhance the usability of AutoML techniques for design decisions in recommender system pipelines.  We focus on developing flexible and library-independent automation techniques for algorithm selection, model selection, and postprocessing steps.  By enabling developers to make informed choices and ease the recommender system development process, we decrease the developer’s effort while improving the performance of the recommender systems.  Moreover, we want to analyze the cost-to-benefit ratio of automation techniques in recommender systems, evaluating the computational overhead and the resulting improvements in predictive performance.  Our objective is to leverage AutoML concepts to automate design decisions in recommender system pipelines, reduce manual effort, and enhance the overall performance and usability of recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Improving Recommender Systems Through the Automation of Design Decisions (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas Wegmeth</p>
    <p>Recommender systems developers are constantly faced with difficult design decisions. Additionally, the number of options that a recommender systems developer has to consider continually grows over time with new innovations. The machine learning community is in a similar situation and has come together to tackle the problem. They invented concepts and tools to make machine learning development both easier and faster. These developments are categorized as automated machine learning (AutoML). As a result, the AutoML community formed and continuously innovates new approaches. Inspired by AutoML, the recommender systems community has recently understood the need for automation and sparsely introduced AutoRecSys. The goal of AutoRecSys is not to replace recommender systems developers but to improve performance through the automation of design decisions. With AutoRecSys, recommender systems engineers do not have to focus on easy but time-consuming tasks and are free to pursue difficult engineering tasks instead. Additionally, AutoRecSys enables easier access to recommender systems for beginners as it reduces the amount of knowledge required to get started with the development of recommender systems. AutoRecSys, like AutoML, is still early in its development and does not yet cover the whole development pipeline. Additionally, it is not yet clear, under which circumstances AutoML approaches can be transferred to recommender systems. Our research intends to close this gap by improving AutoRecSys both with regard to the transfer of AutoML and novel approaches. Furthermore, we focus specifically on the development of novel automation approaches for data processing and training. We note that the realization of AutoRecSys is going to be a community effort. Our part in this effort is to research AutoRecSys fundamentals, build practical tools for the community, raise awareness of the advantages of automation, and catalyze AutoRecSys development.</p>

    <h3>AutoOpt: Automatic Hyperparameter Scheduling and Optimization for Deep Click-through Rate Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yimin Huang, Bo Chen, Yujun Li, Zhenguo Li, Xing Tang, Ruiming Tang</p>
    <p>Click-through Rate (CTR) prediction is essential for commercial recommender systems. Recently, to improve the prediction accuracy, plenty of deep learning-based CTR models have been proposed, which are sensitive to hyperparameters and difficult to optimize well. General hyperparameter optimization methods fix these hyperparameters across the entire model training and repeat them multiple times. This trial-and-error process not only leads to suboptimal performance but also requires non-trivial computation efforts. In this paper, we propose an automatic hyperparameters scheduling and optimization method for deep CTR models, <i>AutoOpt</i>, making the optimization process more stable and efficient. Specifically, the whole training regime is firstly divided into several consecutive stages, where a data-efficient model is learned to model the relation between model states and prediction performance. To optimize the stage-wise hyperparameters, AutoOpt uses the <i>global</i> and <i>local</i> scheduling modules to propose proper hyperparameters for the next stage based on the training in the current stage. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks are conducted to validate the effectiveness of AutoOpt. Moreover, AutoOpt has been deployed onto an advertising platform and a music platform, where online A/B tests also demonstrate superior improvement.</p>

    <h3>OutRank: Speeding up AutoML-based Model Search for Large Sparse Data sets with Cardinality-aware Feature Ranking (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Blaž Škrlj, Blaž Mramor</p>
    <p>The design of modern recommender systems relies on understanding which parts of the feature space are relevant for solving a given recommendation task. However, real-world data sets in this domain are often characterized by their large size, sparsity, and noise, making it challenging to identify meaningful signals. Feature ranking represents an efficient branch of algorithms that can help address these challenges by identifying the most informative features and facilitating the automated search for more compact and better-performing models (AutoML). We introduce OutRank, a system for versatile feature ranking and data quality-related anomaly detection. OutRank was built with categorical data in mind, utilizing a variant of mutual information that is normalized with regard to the noise produced by features of the same cardinality. We further extend the similarity measure by incorporating information on feature similarity and combined relevance. The proposed approach’s feasibility is demonstrated by speeding up the state-of-the-art AutoML system on a synthetic data set with no performance loss. Furthermore, we considered a real-life click-through-rate prediction data set where it outperformed strong baselines such as random forest-based approaches. The proposed approach enables exploration of up to 300% larger feature spaces compared to AutoML-only approaches, enabling faster search for better models on off-the-shelf hardware.</p>

    <h3>AutoRec: An Automated Recommender System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingquan Song, Xiaotian Han, Xia Hu, Zirui Liu, Haifeng Jin, Ting-Hsiang Wang</p>
    <p>Realistic recommender systems are often required to adapt to ever-changing data and tasks or to explore different models systematically. To address the need, we present AutoRec  1  2, an open-source automated machine learning (AutoML) platform extended from the TensorFlow [3] ecosystem and, to our knowledge, the first framework to leverage AutoML for model search and hyperparameter tuning in deep recommendation models. AutoRec also supports a highly flexible pipeline that accommodates both sparse and dense inputs, rating prediction and click-through rate (CTR) prediction tasks, and an array of recommendation models. Lastly, AutoRec provides a simple, user-friendly API. Experiments conducted on the benchmark datasets reveal AutoRec is reliable and can identify models which resemble the best model without prior knowledge.</p>
