    <h3>Towards Health-Aware Fairness in Food Recipe Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehrdad Rostami, Mourad Oussalah, Mohammad Aliannejadi</p>
    <p>Food recommendation systems play a crucial role in suggesting personalized recommendations designed to help users find food and recipes that align with their preferences. However, many existing food recommendation systems have overlooked the important aspect of considering the health and nutritional value of recommended foods, thereby limiting their effectiveness in generating truly healthy recommendations. Our preliminary analysis indicates that users tend to respond positively to unhealthy food and recipes. As a result, existing food recommender systems that neglect health considerations often assign high scores to popular items, inadvertently encouraging unhealthy choices among users. In this study, we propose the development of a fairness-based model that prioritizes health considerations. Our model incorporates fairness constraints from both the user and item perspectives, integrating them into a joint objective framework. Experimental results conducted on real-world food datasets demonstrate that the proposed system not only maintains the ability of food recommendation systems to suggest usersâ€™ favorite foods but also improves the health factor compared to unfair models, with an average enhancement of approximately 35%.</p>

    <h3>Accordion: A Trainable Simulator for Long-Term Interactive Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James McInerney, Ehtsham Elahi, Yves Raimond, Tony Jebara, Justin Basilico</p>
    <p>As machine learning methods are increasingly used in interactive systems it becomes common for user experiences to be the result of an ecosystem of machine learning models in aggregate. Simulation offers a way to deal with the resulting complexity by approximating the real system in a tractable and interpretable manner. Existing methods do not fully incorporate the interactions between user history, recommendation quality, and subsequent visits. We develop Accordion, a trainable simulator based on Poisson processes that can model visit patterns to an interactive system over time from large-scale data. New methods for training and simulation are developed and tested on two datasets of real world interactive systems. Accordion shows greater sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning and offline A/B testing than comparison methods, an important step in building realistic task-oriented simulators for recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Time Slice Imputation for Personalized Goal-based Recommendation in Higher Education (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary A. Pardos, Weijie Jiang</p>
    <p>Learners are often faced with the following scenario: given a goal for the future, and what they have learned in the past, what should they do now to best achieve their goal? We build on work utilizing deep learning to make inferences about how past actions correspond to future outcomes and enhance this work with a novel application of backpropagation to learn per-user optimized actions. We apply this technique to two datasets, one from a university setting in which courses can be recommended towards preparation for a target course, and one from massive open online courses (MOOCs) in which course pages can be recommended towards quiz preparation. In both cases, our algorithm is applied to recommend actions the learner can take to maximize a desired future achievement objective, given their past actions and performance. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>An Insurance Recommendation System Using Bayesian Networks (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katie J. Meissner, Glenn M. Fung, Maleeha Qazi, Eduardo R. Fontes</p>
    <p>In this paper we describe a deployed recommender system to predict insurance products for new and existing customers. Our goal is to give our customers personalized recommendations based on what other similar people with similar portfolios have, in order to make sure they were adequately covered for their needs. Our system uses customer characteristics in addition to customer portfolio data. Since the number of possible recommendable products is relatively small compared to other recommender domains and missing data is relatively frequent, we chose to use Bayesian Networks for modeling our system. Experimental results show advantages of using probabilistic graphical models over the widely used low-rank matrix factorization model for the insurance domain.</p>
