    <h3>Understanding How People Use Natural Language to Ask for Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph A. Konstan, Shuo Chang, Kyle Condiff, F. Maxwell Harper, Jie Kang, Loren Terveen</p>
    <p>The technical barriers for conversing with recommender systems using natural language are vanishing. Already, there are commercial systems that facilitate interactions with an AI agent. For instance, it is possible to say “what should I watch” to an Apple TV remote to get recommendations. In this research, we investigate how users initially interact with a new natural language recommender to deepen our understanding of the range of inputs that these technologies can expect. We deploy a natural language interface to a recommender system, we observe users’ first interactions and follow-up queries, and we measure the differences between speaking- and typing-based interfaces. We employ qualitative methods to derive a categorization of users’ first queries (objective, subjective, and navigation) and follow-up queries (refine, reformulate, start over). We employ quantitative methods to determine the differences between speech and text, finding that speech inputs are typically longer and more conversational.</p>

    <h3>Recommending User Generated Item Lists (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min Xie, Yidan Liu, Laks V.S. Lakshmanan</p>
    <p>Existing recommender systems mostly focus on recommending individual items which users may be interested in. User-generated item lists on the other hand have become a popular feature in many applications. E.g., Goodreads provides users with an interface for creating and sharing interesting book lists. These user-generated item lists complement the main functionality of the corresponding application, and intuitively become an alternative way for users to browse and discover interesting items to be consumed. Unfortunately, existing recommender systems are not designed for recommending user-generated item lists. In this work, we study properties of these user-generated item lists and propose a Bayesian ranking model, called \LRM for recommending them. The proposed \LRM model takes into consideration users’ previous interactions with both item lists and with individual items. Furthermore, we propose in \LRM a novel way of weighting items within item lists based on both position of items, and personalized list consumption pattern. Through extensive experiments on real item list dataset from Goodreads, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed \LRM model.</p>
