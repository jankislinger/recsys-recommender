    <h3>Multi-Step Critiquing User Interface for Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diana Andreea Petrescu, Diego Antognini, Boi Faltings</p>
    <p>Recommendations with personalized explanations have been shown to increase user trust and perceived quality and help users make better decisions. Moreover, such explanations allow users to provide feedback by critiquing them. Several algorithms for recommender systems with multi-step critiquing have therefore been developed. However, providing a user-friendly interface based on personalized explanations and critiquing has not been addressed in the last decade. In this paper, we introduce four different web interfaces (available under https://lia.epfl.ch/critiquing/) helping users making decisions and finding their ideal item. We have chosen the hotel recommendation domain as a use case even though our approach is trivially adaptable for other domains. Moreover, our system is model-agnostic (for both recommender systems and critiquing models) allowing a great flexibility and further extensions. Our interfaces are above all a useful tool to help research in recommendation with critiquing. They allow to test such systems on a real use case and also to highlight some limitations of these approaches to find solutions to overcome them.</p>

    <h3>A Ranking Optimization Approach to Latent Linear Critiquing in Conversational Recommender System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Scott Sanner, Kai Luo, Ga Wu, Hanze Li</p>
    <p>Critiquing is a method for conversational recommendation that incrementally adapts recommendations in response to user preference feedback. Specifically, a user is iteratively provided with item recommendations and attribute descriptions for those items; the user may then either accept the recommendation or choose to critique an attribute to generate a new recommendation. A recent direction known as latent linear critiquing (LLC) takes a modern embedding-based approach that seeks to optimize the combination of user preference embeddings with embeddings of critiques based on subjective item descriptions (i.e., keyphrases from user reviews); LLC does so by exploiting the linear structure of the embeddings to efficiently optimize their weights in a linear programming (LP) formulation. In this paper, we revisit LLC and note that itâ€™s score-based optimization approach inherently encourages extreme weightings in order to maximize predicted score gaps between preferred and non-preferred items. Noting that the overall end task objective in critiquing is to re-rank rather than re-score, in this paper we take a ranking optimization approach that seeks to optimize embedding weights based on observed rank violations from earlier critiquing iterations. We evaluate the proposed framework on two recommendation datasets containing user reviews. Empirical results demonstrate that ranking-based LLC generally outperforms scoring-based LLC and other baselines across a variety of datasets, critiquing styles, and both satisfaction and session-length performance metrics.</p>

    <h3>Deep Language-based Critiquing for Recommender Systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ga Wu, Scott Sanner, Harold Soh, Kai Luo</p>
    <p>Critiquing is a method for conversational recommendation that adapts recommendations in response to user preference feedback regarding item attributes.  Historical critiquing methods were largely based on constraint- and utility-based methods for modifying recommendations w.r.t. these critiqued attributes.  In this paper, we revisit the critiquing approach from the lens of deep learning based recommendation methods and language-based interaction.  Concretely, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework with two variants that extend the Neural Collaborative Filtering architecture with explanation and critiquing components.  These architectures not only predict personalized keyphrases for a user and item but also embed language-based feedback in the latent space that in turn modulates subsequent critiqued recommendations. We evaluate the proposed framework on two recommendation datasets containing user reviews.  Empirical results show that our modified NCF approach not only provides a strong baseline recommender and high-quality personalized item keyphrase suggestions, but that it also properly suppresses items predicted to have a critiqued keyphrase. In summary, this paper provides a first step to unify deep recommendation and language-based feedback in what we hope to be a rich space for future research in deep critiquing for conversational recommendation.</p>
