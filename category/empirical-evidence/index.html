    <h3>How Should We Measure Filter Bubbles? A Regression Model and Evidence for Online News (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Verachtert, Jens Leysen, Annelien Smets, Jorre Vannieuwenhuyze, Lien Michiels, Bart Goethals</p>
    <p>News media play an important role in democratic societies.  Central to fulfilling this role is the premise that users should be exposed to diverse news.  However, news recommender systems are gaining popularity on news websites, which has sparked concerns over filter bubbles. Editors, policy-makers and scholars are worried that news recommender systems may expose users to less diverse content over time.  To the best of our knowledge, this hypothesis has not been tested in a longitudinal observational study of real users that interact with a real news website. Such observational studies require the use of research methods that are robust and can account for the many covariates that may influence the diversity of recommendations at any given time. In this work, we propose an analysis model to study whether the variety of articles recommended to a user decreases over time, in observational studies of real news websites with real users. Further, we present results from two case studies using aggregated and anonymized data that were collected by two western European news websites employing a collaborative filtering-based news recommender system to serve (personalized) recommendations to their users. Through these case studies we validate empirically that our modeling assumptions are sound and supported by the data, and that our model obtains more reliable and interpretable results than analysis methods used in prior empirical work on filter bubbles. Our case studies provide evidence of a small decrease in the topic variety of a userâ€™s recommendations in the first weeks after they sign up, but no evidence of a decrease in political variety.</p>

    <h3>Contrasting Offline and Online Results when Evaluating Recommendation Algorithms (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Rossetti, Fabio Stella, Markus Zanker</p>
    <p>Most evaluations of novel algorithmic contributions assess their accuracy in predicting what was withheld in an offline evaluation scenario. However, several doubts have been raised that standard offline evaluation practices are not appropriate to select the best algorithm for field deployment. The goal of this work is therefore to compare the offline and the online evaluation methodology with the same study participants, i.e. a within users experimental design. This paper presents empirical evidence that the ranking of algorithms based on offline accuracy measurements clearly contradicts the results from the online study with the same set of users. Thus the external validity of the most commonly applied evaluation methodology is not guaranteed.</p>
