    <h3>User-Centric Conversational Recommendation: Adapting the Need of User with Large Language Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gangyi Zhang</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) promise to provide a more natural user experience for exploring and discovering items of interest through ongoing conversation. However, effectively modeling user preferences during conversations and generating personalized recommendations in real time remain challenging problems. Users often express their needs in a vague and evolving manner, and CRS must adapt to capture the dynamics and uncertainty in user preferences to have productive interactions. This research develops user-centric methods for building conversational recommendation system that can understand complex and changing user needs. We propose a graph-based conversational recommendation framework that represents multi-turn conversations as reasoning over a user-item-attribute graph. Enhanced conversational path reasoning incorporates graph neural networks to improve representation learning in this framework. To address uncertainty and dynamics in user preferences, we present the vague preference multi-round conversational recommendation scenario and an adaptive vague preference policy learning solution that employs reinforcement learning to determine recommendation and preference elicitation strategies tailored to the user. Looking to the future, large language models offer promising opportunities to enhance various aspects of CRS, including user modeling, policy learning, response generation.  Overall, this research takes a user-centered perspective in designing conversational agents that can adapt to the inherent ambiguity involved in natural language dialogues with people.</p>

    <h3>Towards Companion Recommenders Assisting Users’ Long-Term Journeys (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minmin Chen, Konstantina Christakopoulou</p>
    <p>Nowadays, with the abundance of the internet content, users expect the recommendation platforms to not only help them with one-off decisions and short-term tasks, but to also support their persistent and overarching interest journeys, including their real-life goals that last days, months or even years. In order for recommender systems to truly assist users through their real-life journeys, they need to first be able to understand and reason about interests, needs, and goals users want to pursue; and then plan taking those into account. However, the task presents several challenges. In this talk, we will present the key steps and elements needed to tackle the problem — particularly (1) user research for interest journeys; (2) personalized and interpretable user profiles; (3) adapting large language models, and other foundational models, for better user understanding; (4) better planning at a macro-level through reinforcement learning and reason-and-act conversational agents; (5) novel journey-powered front end user experiences, allowing for more user control. We hope that the talk will help inspire other researchers, and will pave the way towards companion recommenders that can truly assist the users throughout their interest journeys.</p>

    <h3>DAGFiNN: A Conversational Conference Assistant (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krisztian Balog, Eyvinn Thu Dørheim, Weronika Lajewska, Sander Havn-Sørensen, Narmin Orujova, Sindre Ekrheim Mosand, Pholit Hantula, Rune Henriksen, Nolwenn Bernard, Hengameh Hosseini, Tølløv Alexander Sveen Aresvik, Ekaterina Khlybova, Ivica Kostric</p>
    <p>DAGFiNN is a conversational conference assistant that can be made available for a given conference both as a chatbot on the website and as a Furhat robot physically exhibited at the conference venue. Conference participants can interact with the assistant to get advice on various questions, ranging from where to eat in the city or how to get to the airport to which sessions we recommend them to attend based on the information we have about them. The overall objective is to provide a personalized and engaging experience and allow users to ask a broad range of questions that naturally arise before and during the conference.</p>

    <h3>Recommender Systems in the Internet of Talking Things (IoTT) (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco De Gemmis, Fedelucio Narducci, Pasquale Lops, Giovanni Semeraro</p>
    <p>In the Internet of Things, smart devices are connected to collect and to exchange data. In our vision, in the Internet of Talking Things, objects such as intelligent fridges will be able to communicate with humans to set up preferences and profiling options which allow a personalized usage of the object. In this paper, we present a recommender system implemented as a Telegram Bot, that can fit with the previous scenario. The system is a movie recommender which exploits the information available in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud for generating the recommendations and leading the conversation with the user. It can be easily seen as an intelligent component of a connected TV.</p>
