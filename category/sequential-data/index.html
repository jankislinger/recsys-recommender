    <h3>A new sequential dataset logging interactions, all viewed items and click responses/no-click for recommender systems research (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simen Eide</p>
    <p>We present a novel recommender systems dataset that records the sequential interactions between users and an online marketplace. The users are sequentially presented with both recommendations and search results in the form of ranked lists of items, called slates, from the marketplace (figure 1). The dataset includes the presented slates at each round, whether the user clicked on any of these items and which item the user clicked on. Although the usage of exposure data in recommender systems is growing [ 2, 5, 6 , 9 ], to our knowledge there is no open large-scale recommender systems dataset that includes the slates of items presented to the users at each interaction. As a result, most articles on recommender systems do not utilize this exposure information. Instead, the proposed models only depend on the user’s click responses, and assume that the user is exposed to all the items in the item universe at each step, often called uniform candidate sampling ([3 , 7, 8]). This is an incomplete assumption, as it takes into account items the user might not have been exposed to. This way items might be incorrectly considered as not of interest to the user. Taking into account the actually shown slates allows the models to use a more natural likelihood, based on the click probability given the exposure set of items, as is prevalent in the bandit and reinforcement learning literature [1 , 10 , 13, 14 , 17]. [ 6] shows that likelihoods based on uniform candidate sampling (and similar assumptions) are implicitly assuming that the platform only shows the most relevant items to the user. This causes the recommender system to implicitly reinforce feedback loops and to be biased towards previously exposed items to the user. We hope that the release of this dataset can assist researchers to construct more realistic user preference models by utilizing the exposed slates and contribute to more robust offline evaluation criteria using for example importance sampling [ 12 ]. The dataset along with quickstarts and tutorials are available at https://github.com/finn-no/recsys-slates-dataset.</p>

    <h3>Neural Basket Embedding for Sequential Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vojtěch Vančura</p>
    <p>Next basket prediction from historical purchases is quite a complex task, even for e-commerce datasets with a low number of items that are being purchased repeatedly. Neural approaches are not much better in predicting next purchases than simple heuristics. This paper focuses on the challenge of how to encode baskets into efficient neural embedding with low reconstruction error while maintaining the similarity of baskets in the latent space. In our representation, replacing a product with a similar product or increasing quantity will not change the embedding of the basket much. We believe that good basket representation is critical for subsequent prediction. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art next basket prediction approaches have limitations in their representation of baskets. We would like to focus on this aspect in our future research.</p>

    <h3>Contextual and Sequential User Embeddings for Large-Scale Music Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Mehrotra, Christian Hansen, Casper Hansen, Brian Brost, Federico Tomasi, Lucas Maystre, Mounia Lalmas</p>
    <p>Recommender systems play an important role in providing an engaging experience on online music streaming services. However, the musical domain presents distinctive challenges to recommender systems: tracks are short, listened to multiple times, typically consumed in sessions with other tracks, and relevance is highly context-dependent. In this paper, we argue that modeling users’ preferences at the beginning of a session is a practical and effective way to address these challenges. Using a dataset from Spotify, a popular music streaming service, we observe that a) consumption from the recent past and b) session-level contextual variables (such as the time of the day or the type of device used) are indeed predictive of the tracks a user will stream—much more so than static, average preferences. Driven by these findings, we propose CoSeRNN, a neural network architecture that models users’ preferences as a sequence of embeddings, one for each session. CoSeRNN predicts, at the beginning of a session, a preference vector, based on past consumption history and current context. This preference vector can then be used in downstream tasks to generate contextually relevant just-in-time recommendations efficiently, by using approximate nearest-neighbour search algorithms. We evaluate CoSeRNN on session and track ranking tasks, and find that it outperforms the current state of the art by upwards of 10% on different ranking metrics. Dissecting the performance of our approach, we find that sequential and contextual information are both crucial.</p>

    <h3>When Recurrent Neural Networks meet the Neighborhood for Session-Based Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malte Ludewig, Dietmar Jannach</p>
    <p>Deep learning methods have led to substantial progress in various application fields of AI, and in recent years a number of proposals were made to improve recommender systems with artificial neural networks. For the problem of making session-based recommendations, i.e., for recommending the next item in an anonymous session, Hidasi et al. recently investigated the application of recurrent neural networks with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU4REC). Assessing the true value of such novel approaches based only on what is reported in the literature is however difficult when no standard evaluation protocols are applied and when the strength of the baselines used in the performance comparison is not clear. In this work we show based on a comprehensive empirical evaluation that a heuristics-based nearest neighbor (kNN) scheme for sessions outperforms GRU4REC in the large majority of the tested configurations and datasets. Neighborhood sampling and efficient in-memory data structures ensure the scalability of the kNN method. The best results in the end were often achieved when we combine the kNN approach with GRU4REC, which shows that RNNs can leverage sequential signals in the data that cannot be detected by the co-occurrence-based kNN method.</p>

    <h3>Modelling Contextual Information in Session-Aware Recommender Systems with Neural Networks (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bartłomiej Twardowski</p>
    <p>Preparing recommendations for unknown users or such that correctly respond to the short-term needs of a particular user is one of the fundamental problems for e-commerce. Most of the common Recommender Systems assume that user identification must be explicit. In this paper a Session-Aware Recommender System approach is presented where no straightforward user information is required. The recommendation process is based only on user activity within a single session, defined as a sequence of events. This information is incorporated in the recommendation process by explicit context modeling with factorization methods and a novel approach with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Compared to the session modeling approach, RNN directly models the dependency of user observed sequential behavior throughout its recurrent structure. The evaluation discusses the results based on sessions from real-life system with ephemeral items (identified only by the set of their attributes) for the task of top-n best recommendations.</p>
