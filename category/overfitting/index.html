    <h3>Taming the One-Epoch Phenomenon in Online Recommendation System by Two-stage Contrastive ID Pre-training (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chantat Eksombatchai, Jiajing Xu, Yi-Ping Hsu, Po-Wei Wang</p>
    <p>ID-based embeddings are widely used in web-scale online recommendation systems. However, their susceptibility to overfitting, particularly due to the long-tail nature of data distributions, often limits training to a single epoch, a phenomenon known as the “one-epoch problem.” This challenge has driven research efforts to optimize performance within the first epoch by enhancing convergence speed or feature sparsity. In this study, we introduce a novel two-stage training strategy that incorporates a pre-training phase using a minimal model with contrastive loss, enabling broader data coverage for the embedding system. Our offline experiments demonstrate that multi-epoch training during the pre-training phase does not lead to overfitting, and the resulting embeddings improve online generalization when fine-tuned for more complex downstream recommendation tasks. We deployed the proposed system in live traffic at Pinterest, achieving significant site-wide engagement gains.</p>

    <h3>Field-aware Probabilistic Embedding Neural Network for CTR Prediction (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Jinkai, Huifeng Guo, Xiuqiang He, Jiajin Li, Shengyu Zhang, Weiwen Liu, Ruiming Tang</p>
    <p>For Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, Field-aware Factorization Machines (FFM) have exhibited great effectiveness by considering field information. However, it is also observed that FFM suffers from the overfitting problem in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Field-aware Probabilistic Embedding Neural Network (FPENN) model with both good generalization ability and high accuracy. FPENN estimates the probability distribution of the field-aware embedding rather than using the single point estimation (the maximum a posteriori estimation) to prevent overfitting. Both low-order and high-order feature interactions are considered to improve the accuracy. FPENN consists of three components, i.e., FPE component, Quadratic component and Deep component. FPE component outputs probabilistic embedding to the other two components, where various confidence levels for feature embeddings are incorporated to enhance the robustness and the accuracy. Quadratic component is designed for extracting low-order feature interactions, while Deep component aims at capturing high-order feature interactions. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, Avazu and Criteo. The results confirm that our model alleviates the overfitting problem while has a higher accuracy.</p>
