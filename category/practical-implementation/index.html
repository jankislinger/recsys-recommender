    <h3>Exploration with Model Uncertainty at Extreme Scale in Real-Time Bidding (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davorin Kopič, Jan Hartman</p>
    <p>In this work, we present a scalable and efficient system for exploring the supply landscape in real-time bidding. The system directs exploration based on the predictive uncertainty of models used for click-through rate prediction and works in a high-throughput, low-latency environment. Through online A/B testing, we demonstrate that exploration with model uncertainty has a positive impact on model performance and business KPIs.</p>

    <h3>Evaluating Off-Policy Evaluation: Sensitivity and Robustness (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Mogi, Yuta Saito, Kei Tateno, Yusuke Narita, Haruka Kiyohara, Takuma Udagawa</p>
    <p>Off-policy Evaluation (OPE), or offline evaluation in general, evaluates the performance of hypothetical policies leveraging only offline log data. It is particularly useful in applications where the online interaction involves high stakes and expensive setting such as precision medicine and recommender systems. Since many OPE estimators have been proposed and some of them have hyperparameters to be tuned, there is an emerging challenge for practitioners to select and tune OPE estimators for their specific application. Unfortunately, identifying a reliable estimator from results reported in research papers is often difficult because the current experimental procedure evaluates and compares the estimators’ performance on a narrow set of hyperparameters and evaluation policies. Therefore, it is difficult to know which estimator is safe and reliable to use. In this work, we develop Interpretable Evaluation for Offline Evaluation (IEOE), an experimental procedure to evaluate OPE estimators’ robustness to changes in hyperparameters and/or evaluation policies in an interpretable manner. Then, using the IEOE procedure, we perform extensive evaluation of a wide variety of existing estimators on Open Bandit Dataset, a large-scale public real-world dataset for OPE. We demonstrate that our procedure can evaluate the estimators’ robustness to the hyperparamter choice, helping us avoid using unsafe estimators. Finally, we apply IEOE to real-world e-commerce platform data and demonstrate how to use our protocol in practice.</p>

    <h3>Quality Metrics in Recommender Systems: Do We Calculate Metrics Consistently? (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rinchin Damdinov, Alexey Vasilev, Yan-Martin Tamm</p>
    <p>Offline evaluation is a popular approach to determine the best algorithm in terms of the chosen quality metric. However, if the chosen metric calculates something unexpected, this miscommunication can lead to poor decisions and wrong conclusions. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate quality metrics used for recommender systems evaluation. We look at the practical aspect of implementations found in modern RecSys libraries and at the theoretical aspect of definitions in academic papers. We find that Precision is the only metric universally understood among papers and libraries, while other metrics may have different interpretations. Metrics implemented in different libraries sometimes have the same name but measure different things, which leads to different results given the same input. When defining metrics in an academic paper, authors sometimes omit explicit formulations or give references that do not contain explanations either. In 47% of cases, we cannot easily know how the metric is defined because the definition is not clear or absent. These findings highlight yet another difficulty in recommender system evaluation and call for a more detailed description of evaluation protocols.</p>
