    <h3>A New Perspective in Health Recommendations: Integration of Human Pose Estimation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaetano Dibenedetto</p>
    <p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in multimodal and multi-source data due to their ability to introduce heterogeneous information. Studies have demonstrated that combining such information enhances the performance of Recommender Systems across various scenarios. In the context of Health Recommendation Systems (HRS), different types of data are utilized, primarily focusing on patient-based information, but data from Pose Estimations (PE) are not incorporated. The objective of my Ph.D. is to investigate methods to design and develop HRS that treat the PE as one of the input sources, taking into account aspects such as privacy concerns and balancing the trade-off between system quality and responsiveness. By leveraging the combination of diverse information sources, I intend to create a new model in the area of HRS capable of providing more precise and explainable recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Exploring Coresets for Efficient Training and Consistent Evaluation of Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Ju, Neil Hurley, Honghui Du, Elias Tragos, Aonghus Lawlor</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have achieved remarkable success in various web applications, such as e-commerce, online advertising, and social media, harnessing the power of big data. To attain optimal model performance, recommender systems are typically trained on very large datasets, with substantial numbers of users and items. However, large datasets often present challenges in terms of processing time and computational resources. Coreset selection offers a method for obtaining a reduced yet representative subset from vast datasets, thereby enhancing the efficiency of training machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, little research has been conducted to explore the practical implications of different coreset selection approaches on the performance of recommender systems algorithms. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of various coreset selection techniques. We evaluate the performance of the resulting coresets using inductive recommendation models which allow for consistent evaluations to be performed. The experimental results demonstrate that coreset methods are a powerful and useful approach for obtaining reduced datasets which preserve the properties of the large original dataset and have competitive performance compared to the time required to train with the full dataset.</p>

    <h3>Democratizing Urban Mobility Through an Open-Source, Multi-Criteria Route Recommendation System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Eggerth, Javier Argota Sánchez-Vaquerizo, Sachit Mahajan, Dirk Helbing</p>
    <p>Urban navigation systems traditionally optimize for efficiency, thereby overlooking environmental factors and personal preferences. This paper introduces Routify, a novel multi-criteria recommender system for personalized urban route selection. Routify advances the state-of-the-art in route recommendation through: (1) integration of diverse environmental data (air quality, noise levels, green spaces) with real-time IoT inputs; (2) a dynamic weighting algorithm allowing fine-grained user control over routing parameters; (3) transparent decision-making via an interactive interface displaying edge-level information; and (4) a community-driven feedback mechanism that continuously refines recommendations. We have implemented Routify as an open-source platform, facilitating further research and development. Experimental results from 1000 origin-destination pairs demonstrate significant improvements in user-defined environmental metrics (up to 32.98% increase in green index for walking and 16.91% reduction in noise levels for cycling) compared to traditional routing systems. These improvements come with slight trade-offs in distance, especially in walking mode. Our research contributes a comprehensive framework for multi-criteria route recommendation, balancing individual preferences, environmental factors, and community insights in urban navigation.</p>

    <h3>Reproducibility and Analysis of Scientific Dataset Recommendation Methods (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianmaria Silvello, Matteo Lissandrini, Ornella Irrera, Daniele Dell’Aglio</p>
    <p>Datasets play a central role in scholarly communications. However, scholarly graphs are often incomplete, particularly due to the lack of connections between publications and datasets. Therefore, the importance of dataset recommendation—identifying relevant datasets for a scientific paper, an author, or a textual query—is increasing. Although various methods have been proposed for this task, their reproducibility remains unexplored, making it difficult to compare them with new approaches. We reviewed current recommendation methods for scientific datasets, focusing on the most recent and competitive approaches,  including an SVM-based model, a bi-encoder retriever, a method leveraging co-authors and citation network embeddings, and a heterogeneous variational graph autoencoder.  These approaches underwent a comprehensive analysis under consistent experimental conditions. Our reproducibility efforts show that three methods can be reproduced, while the graph variational autoencoder is challenging due to unavailable code and test datasets.  Hence, we re-implemented this method and performed a component-based analysis to examine its strengths and limitations. Furthermore, our study indicated that three out of four considered methods produce subpar results when applied to real-world data instead of specialized datasets with ad-hoc features.</p>

    <h3>Multimodal Representation Learning for high-quality Recommendations in Cold-start and Beyond-Accuracy (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marta Moscati</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RS) traditionally leverage the large amount of user–item interaction data. This exposes RS to a lower recommendation quality in cold-start scenarios, as well as to a low recommendation quality in terms of beyond-accuracy evaluation metrics. State-of-the-art (SotA) models for cold-start scenarios rely on the use of side information on the items or the users, therefore relating recommendation to multimodal machine learning (ML). However, the most recent techniques from multimodal ML are often not applied to the domain of recommendation. Additionally, the evaluation of SotA multimodal RS often neglects beyond-accuracy aspects of recommendation. In this work, we outline research into designing novel multimodal RS based on SotA multimodal ML architectures for cold-start recommendation, and their evaluation and benchmark with preexisting multimodal RS in terms of accuracy and beyond-accuracy aspects of recommendation quality.</p>

    <h3>Privacy Preserving Conversion Modeling in Data Clean Room (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Behnam Rezaei, Xiangyi Chen, Ling Leng, Jiajing Xu, Jiankai Sun, Kungang Li</p>
    <p>In the realm of online advertising, accurately predicting the conversion rates (CVR) is crucial for enhancing advertising efficiency and user satisfaction. However, it faces the challenge that due to user privacy choices and advertiser requirements, the advertising platform cannot get the conversion data from some advertisers, making accurate CVR predictions difficult. Although current methods like split learning or vertical federated learning do not share label information directly, they still exchange sample-level gradients, which introduces a privacy risk as adversaries might infer label information through the shared gradients. To address these challenges, our proposed model training framework incorporates several innovative techniques. Firstly, we employ batch-level aggregated gradients instead of sample-level gradients to enhance privacy. Secondly, to minimize communication costs, we utilize adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and gradient compression in conversion models. These methods allow for efficient collaboration between different parties while reducing the amount of data transferred. Lastly, we incorporate label differential privacy to protect model privacy. Given that this privacy protection alters the data distribution and can result in significant calibration error, we propose a de-biasing technique to ensure accurate model predictions even with perturbed label information. Our experimental results on industrial datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing the communication overhead and complying with advertisers’ privacy requirements and user privacy choice. This framework establishes a new benchmark for privacy-preserving and high-performance CVR prediction in the digital advertising industry.</p>

    <h3>Bayesian Optimization with LLM-Based Acquisition Functions for Natural Language Preference Elicitation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armin Toroghi, David Austin, Anton Korikov, Scott Sanner</p>
    <p>Designing preference elicitation (PE) methodologies that can quickly ascertain a user’s top item preferences in a cold-start setting is a key challenge for building effective and personalized conversational recommendation (ConvRec) systems. While large language models (LLMs) constitute a novel technology that enables fully natural language (NL) PE dialogues, we hypothesize that monolithic LLM NL-PE approaches lack the multi-turn, decision-theoretic reasoning required to effectively balance the NL exploration and exploitation of user preferences towards an arbitrary item set. In contrast, traditional Bayesian optimization PE methods define theoretically optimal PE strategies, but fail to use NL item descriptions or generate NL queries, unrealistically assuming users can express preferences with direct item ratings and comparisons. To overcome the limitations of both approaches, we formulate NL-PE in a Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework that seeks to actively elicit natural language feedback to reduce uncertainty over item utilities to identify the best recommendation. Key challenges in generalizing BO to deal with natural language feedback include determining (a) how to leverage LLMs to model the likelihood of NL preference feedback as a function of item utilities and (b) how to design an acquisition function that works for language-based BO that can elicit in the infinite space of language. We demonstrate our framework in a novel NL-PE algorithm, PEBOL, which uses Natural Language Inference (NLI) between user preference utterances and NL item descriptions to maintain preference beliefs and BO strategies such as Thompson Sampling (TS) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to guide LLM query generation. We numerically evaluate our methods in controlled experiments, finding that PEBOL achieves up to 131% improvement in MAP@10 after 10 turns of cold start NL-PE dialogue compared to monolithic GPT-3.5, despite relying on a much smaller 400M parameter NLI model for preference inference.</p>

    <h3>Bridging Viewpoints in News with Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia Hua Jeng</p>
    <p>News Recommender systems (NRSs) aid in decision-making in news media. However, undesired effects can emerge. Among these are selective exposures that may contribute to polarization, potentially reinforcing existing attitudes through belief perseverance—discounting contrary evidence due to their opposing attitudinal strength. This can be unsafe for people, making it difficult to accept information objectively. A crucial issue in news recommender system research is how to mitigate these undesired effects by designing recommender interfaces and machine learning models that enable people to consider to be more open to different perspectives. Alongside accurate models, the user experience is an equally important measure. Indeed, the core statistics are based on users’ behaviors and experiences in this research project. Therefore, this research agenda aims to steer the choices of readers’ based on altering their attitudes. The core methods plan to concentrate on the interface design and ML model building involving manipulations of cues, users’ behaviors prediction, NRSs algorithm and changing the nudges. In sum, the project aims to provide insight in the extent to which news recommender systems can be effective in mitigating polarized opinions.</p>

    <h3>The Fault in Our Recommendations: On the Perils of Optimizing the Measurable (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshit Kumar, Yash Kanoria, Omar Besbes</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems play a pivotal role on digital platforms by curating content, products and services for users. These systems are widespread, and through customized recommendations, promise to match users with options they will like. To that end,  data on engagement is collected and used, with, e.g., measurements of clicks, but also  purchases or consumption times.   Most recommendation systems are ranking-based, where they rank and recommend items based on their predicted engagement.  However, the engagement signals  are often only a crude proxy for user utility, as data on the latter is rarely collected or available. This paper explores the following critical research question: By optimizing for measurable proxies, are recommendation systems at risk of significantly under-delivering on user utility? If that is indeed the case, how can one improve utility which is seldom measured? To study these questions, we introduce a model of repeated user consumption in which, at each interaction, users select between an outside option and the best option from a recommendation set. Our model accounts for user heterogeneity, with the majority preferring “popular” content, and a minority favoring “niche” content. The system initially lacks knowledge of individual user preferences but can learn these preferences through observations of users’ choices over time. Our theoretical and numerical analysis demonstrate that optimizing for engagement signals can lead to significant utility losses. Instead, we propose a utility-aware policy that initially recommends a mix of popular and niche content. We show that such a policy substantially improves  utility despite not measuring it. In fact, in the limit of a forward-looking platform with discount factor $\delta \to 1$, our utility-aware policy achieves the best of both worlds: near-optimal user utility and near-optimal engagement simultaneously. Our study elucidates  an important feature of recommendation systems; given the ability to suggest multiple items, one can perform significant exploration without incurring significant reductions in short term engagement. By recommending high-risk, high-reward items alongside popular items, systems can enhance discovery of high utility items without significantly affecting engagement.</p>

    <h3>Information-Controllable Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixuan Yang, Zirui Guo, Yanhua Yu, Liang Pang, Tat-Seng Chua, Kangkang Lu, Yuling Wang</p>
    <p>In the evolving landscape of recommender systems, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has become a prominent method for enhancing recommendation performance by alleviating the issue of data sparsity. However, existing GCL-based recommendations often overlook the control of shared information between the contrastive views. In this paper, we initially analyze and experimentally demonstrate these methods often lead to the issue of augmented representation collapse, where the representations between views become excessively similar, diminishing their distinctiveness. To address this issue, we propose the Information-Controllable Graph Contrastive Learning (IGCL) framework, a novel approach that focuses on optimizing the shared information between views to include as much relevant information for the recommendation task as possible while maintaining an appropriate level. In particular, we design the Collaborative Signals Enhanced Augmentation module to infuse the augmented representation with rich, task-relevant collaborative signals. Furthermore, the Information-Controllable Contrastive Learning module is designed to direct control over the magnitude of shared information between the contrastive views to avoid over-similarity. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IGCL, showcasing significant improvements in performance and the capability to alleviate augmented representation collapse.</p>

    <h3>Improving the Shortest Plank: Vulnerability-Aware Adversarial Training for Robust Recommender System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fei Sun, Qi Cao, Yunfan Wu, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng, Kaike Zhang</p>
    <p>Recommender systems play a pivotal role in mitigating information overload in diverse fields. Nonetheless, the inherent openness of these systems introduces vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to insert fake users to skew the exposure of certain items, known as poisoning attacks. Adversarial training emerges as a notable defense mechanism against such poisoning attacks within recommender systems. Traditional adversarial training methods apply perturbations with the same scale across all users to their embeddings to maintain system robustness against the worst-case attacks. Yet, in reality, attacks often affect only a subset of users who are actually vulnerable to the specific attacks. These indiscriminate perturbations make it difficult to balance effective protection for vulnerable users and avoidance of recommendation quality degradation for those who are not. To address this issue, our research delves into understanding user vulnerability. Considering that poisoning attacks pollutes the training data, we observe that the extent of a recommender system’s fit to users’ training data, particularly when high, correlates with an increased likelihood of users incorporating attack information, thus indicating their vulnerability. Leveraging these insights, we introduce the Vulnerability-aware Adversarial Training (VAT) method, designed to counteract poisoning attacks in recommender systems. VAT employs a novel vulnerability-aware function to estimate users’ vulnerability based on the degree to which they are fitted by the system. Guided by this evaluation, VAT applies user-specific perturbations to embeddings. thereby not only reducing the success rate of attacks but also preserving—and potentially enhancing—the quality of recommendations. Comprehensive experiments confirm VAT’s superior defensive capabilities against various attacks and recommendation models.</p>

    <h3>Beyond the Sequence: Statistics-driven Pre-training for Stabilizing Sequential Recommendation Model (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongzhi Zhang, Sirui Wang, Yunsen Xian, Peiguang Li</p>
    <p>The sequential recommendation task aims to predict the item that user is interested in according to his/her historical action sequence. However, inevitable random action, i.e. user randomly accesses an item among multiple candidates or clicks several items at random order, cause the sequence fails to provide stable and high-quality signals. To alleviate the issue, we propose the StatisTics-Driven Pre-traing framework (called STDP briefly). The main idea of the work lies in the exploration of utilizing the statistics information along with the pre-training paradigm to stabilize the optimization of recommendation model. Specifically, we derive two types of statistical information: item co-occurrence across sequence and attribute frequency within the sequence. And we design the following pre-training tasks: 1) The co-occurred items prediction task, which encourages the model to distribute its attention on multiple suitable targets instead of just focusing on the next item that may be unstable. 2) We generate a paired sequence by replacing items with their co-occurred items and enforce its representation close with the original one, thus enhancing the model’s robustness to the random noise. 3) To reduce the impact of random on user’s long-term preferences, we encourage the model to capture sequence-level frequent attributes. The significant improvement over six datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposal, and further analysis verified the generalization of the STDP framework on other models.</p>

    <h3>Using Learnable Physics for Real-Time Exercise Form Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gautam Chauhan, Abhishek Jaiswal, Nisheeth Srivastava</p>
    <p>Good posture and form are essential for safe and productive exercising. Even in gym settings, trainers may not be readily available for feedback. Rehabilitation therapies and fitness workouts can thus benefit from recommender systems that provide real-time evaluation. In this paper, we present an algorithmic pipeline that can diagnose problems in exercises technique and offer corrective recommendations, with high sensitivity and specificity, in real-time. We use MediaPipe for pose recognition, count repetitions using peak-prominence detection, and use a learnable physics simulator to track motion evolution for each exercise. A test video is diagnosed based on deviations from the prototypical learned motion using statistical learning. The system is evaluated on six full and upper body exercises. These real-time interactive suggestions counseled via low-cost equipment like smartphones will allow exercisers to rectify potential mistakes making self-practice feasible while reducing the risk of workout injuries.</p>

    <h3>Exploring Unlearning Methods to Ensure the Privacy, Security, and Usability of Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jens Leysen</p>
    <p>Machine learning algorithms have proven highly effective in analyzing large amounts of data and identifying complex patterns and relationships. One application of machine learning that has received significant attention in recent years is recommender systems, which are algorithms that analyze user behavior and other data to suggest items or content that a user may be interested in. However useful, these systems may unintentionally retain sensitive, outdated, or faulty information. Posing a risk to user privacy, system security, and limiting a system’s usability. In this research proposal, we aim to address these challenges by investigating methods for machine “unlearning”, which would allow information to be efficiently “forgotten” or “unlearned” from machine learning models. The main objective of this proposal is to develop the foundation for future machine unlearning methods. We first evaluate current unlearning methods and explore novel adversarial attacks on these methods’ verifiability, efficiency, and accuracy to gain new insights and further develop the theory of machine unlearning. Using our gathered insights, we seek to create novel unlearning methods that are verifiable, efficient, and limit unnecessary accuracy degradation. Through this research, we seek to make significant contributions to the theoretical foundations of machine unlearning while also developing unlearning methods that can be applied to real-world problems.</p>
