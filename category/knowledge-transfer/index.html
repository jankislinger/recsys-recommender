    <h3>Data-free Knowledge Distillation for Reusing Recommendation Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jieming Zhu, Zhenguo Li, Rui Zhang, Cheng Wang, Ruixuan Li, Zhenhua Dong, Jiacheng Sun</p>
    <p>A common practice to keep the freshness of an offline Recommender System (RS) is to train models that fit the user’s most recent behaviours while directly replacing the outdated historical model. However, many feature engineering and computing resources are used to train these historical models, but they are underutilized in the downstream RS model training. In this paper, to turn these historical models into treasures, we introduce a model inversed data synthesis framework, which can recover training data information from the historical model and use it for knowledge transfer. This framework synthesizes a new form of data from the historical model. Specifically, we ‘invert’ an off-the-shield pretrained model to synthesize binary class user-item pairs beginning from random noise without requiring any additional information from the training dataset. To synthesize new data from a pretrained model, we update the input from random float initialization rather than one- or multi-hot vectors. An additional statistical regularization is added to further improve the quality of the synthetic data inverted from the deep model with batch normalization. The experimental results show that our framework can generalize across different types of models. We can efficiently train different types of classical Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction models from scratch with significantly few inversed synthetic data (2 orders of magnitude). Moreover, our framework can also work well in the knowledge transfer scenarios such as continual updating and data-free knowledge distillation.</p>

    <h3>Exploring Clustering of Bandits for Online Recommendation System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Xia, Qiang Yang, Bo Liu, Kai Chen, Leyu Lin, Liu Yang</p>
    <p>Cluster-of-bandit policy leverages contextual bandits in a collaborative filtering manner and aids personalized services in the online recommendation system (RecSys). When facing insufficient observations, the cluster-of-bandit policy could achieve more outstanding performance because of knowledge sharing. Cluster-of-bandit policy aims to maximize the cumulative feedback, e.g., clicks, from users. Nevertheless, in the way of their goal exist two kinds of uncertainties. First, cluster-of-bandit algorithms make recommendations according to their uncertain estimation of user interests. Second, cluster-of-bandit algorithms transfer relevant knowledge upon uncertain and noisy user clusters. Existing algorithms only consider the first one, while leaving the latter one untouched. To address the two challenges together, in this paper, we propose the ClexB policy for online RecSys. On the one hand, ClexB estimates user clustering more accurately and with less uncertainty via explorable-clustering. On the other hand, ClexB also exploits and explores user interests by sharing information within and among user clusters. In summary, ClexB explores knowledge transfer and further aids the inferences about user interests. Besides, we provide extensive empirical experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets and regret analysis, further consolidating the superiority of ClexB.</p>

    <h3>Cross-Domain Recommendations Without Overlapping Data: Myth or Reality? (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Cremonesi, Massimo Quadrana</p>
    <p>Cross-domain recommender systems adopt different tech- niques to transfer learning from source domain to target domain in order to alleviate the sparsity problem and improve accuracy of recommendations. Traditional techniques require the two domains to be linked by shared characteristics associated to either users or items. In collaborative-filtering (CF) this happens when the two domains have overlapping users or item (at least partially). Recently, Li et al. [7] introduced codebook transfer (CBT), a cross-domain CF technique based on co-clustering, and presented experimental results showing that CBT is able to transfer knowledge between non-overlapping domains. In this paper, we disprove these results and show that CBT does not transfer useful knowledge when source and target domains do not overlap.</p>
