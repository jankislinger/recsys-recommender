    <h3>Evaluating the Pros and Cons of Recommender Systems Explanations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kathrin Wardatzky</p>
    <p>Despite the growing interest in explainable AI in the RecSys community, the evaluation of explanations is still an open research topic. Typically, explanations are evaluated using offline metrics, with a case study, or through a user study. In my research, I will have a closer look at the evaluation of the effects of explanations on users. I investigate two possible factors that can impact the effects reported in recent publications, namely the explanation design and content as well as the users themselves. I further address the problem of determining promising explanations for an application scenario from a seemingly endless pool of options. Lastly, I propose a user study to close some of the research gaps established in the surveys and investigate how recommender systems explanations impact the understanding of users with different backgrounds.</p>

    <h3>Judging Similarity: A User-Centric Study of Related Item Recommendations (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Yao, F. Maxwell Harper</p>
    <p>Related item recommenders operate in the context of a particular item. For instance, a music systemâ€™s page about the artist Radiohead might recommend other similar artists such as The Flaming Lips. Often central to these recommendations is the computation of similarity between pairs of items. Prior work has explored many algorithms and features that allow for the computation of similarity scores, but little work has evaluated these approaches from a user-centric perspective. In this work, we build and evaluate six similarity scoring algorithms that span a range of activity- and content-based approaches. We evaluate the performance of these algorithms using both offline metrics and a new set of more than 22,000 user-contributed evaluations. We integrate these results with a survey of more than 700 participants concerning their expectations about item similarity and related item recommendations. We find that content-based algorithms outperform ratings- and clickstream-based algorithms in terms of how well they match user expectations for similarity and recommendation quality. Our results yield a number of implications to guide the construction of related item recommendation algorithms.</p>
