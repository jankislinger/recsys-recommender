    <h3>Improving Group Recommendations using Personality, Dynamic Clustering and Multi-Agent MicroServices (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> André Martins, Goreti Marreiros, Patrícia Alves, Paulo Novais</p>
    <p>The complexity associated to group recommendations needs strategies to mitigate several problems, such as the group’s heterogeinity and conflicting preferences, the emotional contagion phenomenon, the cold-start problem, and the group members’ needs and concerns while providing recommendations that satisfy all members at once. In this demonstration, we show how we implemented a Multi-Agent Microservice to represent the tourists in a mobile Group Recommender System for Tourism prototype. A novel dynamic clustering process is presented to help minimize the group’s heterogeneity and conflicting preferences. To help solve the cold-start problem, the preliminary tourist attractions preference and travel-related preferences & concerns are predicted using the tourists’ personality, while taking the tourists’ disabilities and fears into account. Although there is no need for previous interactions data to build the tourists’ profile since we predict the tourists’ preferences, the tourist agents learn with each other by using association rules to find patterns in the tourists’ profile and in the ratings given to Points of Interest to refine the recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Predictability Limits in Session-based Next Item Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priit Järv</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendations are based on the user’s recent actions, for example, the items they have viewed during the current browsing session or the sightseeing places they have just visited. Closely related is sequence-aware recommendation, where the choice of the next item should follow from the sequence of previous actions. We study seven benchmarks for session-based recommendation, covering retail, music and news domains to investigate how accurately user behavior can be predicted from the session histories. We measure the entropy rate of the data and estimate the limit of predictability to be between 44% and 73% in the included datasets. We establish some algorithm-specific limits on prediction accuracy for Markov chains, association rules and k-nearest neighbors methods. With most of the analyzed methods, the algorithm design limits their performance with sparse training data. The session based k-nearest neighbors are least restricted in comparison and have room for improvement across all of the analyzed datasets.</p>
