    <h3>An Interpretable Neural Network Model for Bundle Recommendations (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward C. Malthouse, Xinyi Li</p>
    <p>A users’ preference for a bundle – a set of items that can be purchased together – can be expressed by the utility of this bundle to the user. The multi-attribute utility theory motivate us to characterize the utility of a bundle using its attributes to improve the personalized bundle recommendation systems. This extended abstract for the Doctoral Symposium describes my PhD project for studying the utility of a bundle using its attributes. The steps taken and some preliminary results are presented, with an outline of the future plans.</p>

    <h3>Mechanism Design for Personalized Recommender Systems (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chang Liu, Pingzhong Tang, Qingpeng Cai, Aris Filos-Ratsikas</p>
    <p>Strategic behaviour from sellers on e-commerce websites, such as faking transactions and manipulating the recommendation scores through artificial reviews, have been among the most notorious obstacles that prevent websites from maximizing the efficiency of their recommendations. Previous approaches have focused almost exclusively on machine learning-related techniques to detect and penalize such behaviour. In this paper, we tackle the problem from a different perspective, using the approach of the field of mechanism design. We put forward a game model tailored for the setting at hand and aim to construct truthful mechanisms, i.e. mechanisms that do not provide incentives for dishonest reputation-augmenting actions, that guarantee good recommendations in the worst-case. For the setting with two agents, we propose a truthful mechanism that is optimal in terms of social efficiency. For the general case of m agents, we prove both lower and upper bound results on the effciency of truthful mechanisms and propose truthful mechanisms that yield significantly better results, when compared to an existing mechanism from a leading e-commerce site on real data.</p>

    <h3>Observing Group Decision Making Processes (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laurens Rook, Markus Zanker, Hannes Werthner, Julia Neidhardt, Francesco Ricci, Amra Delic, Thuy Ngoc Nguyen</p>
    <p>Most research on group recommender systems relies on the assumption that individuals have conflicting preferences; in order to generate group recommendations the system should identify a fair way of aggregating these preferences. Both empirical studies and theoretical frameworks have tried to identify the most effective preference aggregation techniques without coming to definite conclusions. In this paper, we propose to approach group recommendation from the group dynamics perspective and analyze the group decision making process for a particular task (in the travel domain). We observe several individual and group properties and correlate them to choice satisfaction. Supported by these initial results we therefore advocate for the development of new group recommendation techniques that consider group dynamics and support the full group decision making process.</p>
