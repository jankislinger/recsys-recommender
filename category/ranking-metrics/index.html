    <h3>Climbing crags repetitive choices and recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iustina Ivanova</p>
    <p>Outdoor sport climbing in Northern Italy attracts climbers from around the world. While this country has many rock formations, it offers enormous possibilities for adventurous people to explore the mountains. Unfortunately, this great potential causes a problem in finding suitable destinations (crags) to visit for climbing activity. Existing recommender systems in this domain address this issue and suggest potentially interesting items to climbers utilizing a content-based approach. These systems understand users’ preferences from their past logs recorded in an electronic training diary. At the same time, some sports people have a behavioral tendency to revisit the same place for subjective reasons. It might be related to weather and seasonality (for instance, some crags are suitable for climbing in winter/summer only), the users’ preferences (when climbers like specific destinations more than others), or personal goals to be achieved in sport (when climbers plan to try some routes again). Unfortunately, current climbing crags recommendations do not adapt when users demonstrate these repetitive behavior patterns. Sequential recommender systems can capture such users’ habits since their architectures were designed to model users’ next item choice by learning from their previous decision manners. To understand to which extent these sequential recommendations can predict the following crags choices in sport climbing, we analyzed a scenario when climbers show repetitious decisions. Further, we present a data set from collected climbers’ e-logs in the Arco region (Italy) and applied several sequential recommender systems architectures for predicting climbers’ following crags’ visits from their past logs. We evaluated these recommender systems offline and compared ranking metrics with the other reported results on the different data sets. The work concludes that sequential models obtain comparably accurate results as in the other studies and have the prospect for climbers’ subsequent visit prediction and crags recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Unbiased Learning for the Causal Effect of Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janmajay Singh, Masahiro Sato, Tomoko Ohkuma, Sho Takemori</p>
    <p>Increasing users’ positive interactions, such as purchases or clicks, is an important objective of recommender systems. Recommenders typically aim to select items that users will interact with. If the recommended items are purchased, an increase in sales is expected. However, the items could have been purchased even without recommendation. Thus, we want to recommend items that results in purchases caused by recommendation. This can be formulated as a ranking problem in terms of the causal effect. Despite its importance, this problem has not been well explored in the related research. It is challenging because the ground truth of causal effect is unobservable, and estimating the causal effect is prone to the bias arising from currently deployed recommenders. This paper proposes an unbiased learning framework for the causal effect of recommendation. Based on the inverse propensity scoring technique, the proposed framework first constructs unbiased estimators for ranking metrics. Then, it conducts empirical risk minimization on the estimators with propensity capping, which reduces variance under finite training samples. Based on the framework, we develop an unbiased learning method for the causal effect extension of a ranking metric. We theoretically analyze the unbiasedness of the proposed method and empirically demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other biased learning methods in various settings.</p>

    <h3>Gaussian Ranking by Matrix Factorization (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harald Steck</p>
    <p>The ranking quality at the top of the list is crucial in many real-world applications of recommender systems. In this paper, we present a novel framework that allows for pointwise as well as listwise training with respect to various ranking metrics. This is based on a training objective function where we assume that, for given a user, the recommender system predicts scores for all items that follow approximately a distribution. We motivate this assumption from the properties of implicit feedback data. As a model, we use matrix factorization and extend it by non-linear activation functions, as customary in the literature of artificial neural networks. In particular, we use non-linear activation functions derived from our Gaussian assumption. Our preliminary experimental results show that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods with respect to optimizing the Area under the ROC curve, while it is particularly effective in optimizing the head of the ranked list.</p>
