    <h3>AI-assisted Coding with Cody: Lessons from Context Retrieval and Evaluation for Code Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quinn Slack, Jan Hartman, Dominic Cooney, Rishabh Mehrotra, Hitesh Sagtani, Olaf Geirsson, Beyang Liu, Rafal Gajdulewicz, Julie Tibshirani</p>
    <p>In this work, we discuss a recently popular type of recommender system: an LLM-based coding assistant. Connecting the task of providing code recommendations in multiple formats to traditional RecSys challenges, we outline several similarities and differences due to domain specifics. We emphasize the importance of providing relevant context to an LLM for this use case and discuss lessons learned from context enhancements & offline and online evaluation of such AI-assisted coding systems.</p>

    <h3>Optimally Balancing Receiver and Recommended Users’ Importance in Reciprocal Recommender Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Ricci, Rosenfeld Ariel, Akiva Kleinerman, Sarit Kraus</p>
    <p>Online platforms which assist people in finding a suitable partner or match, such as online dating and job recruiting environments, have become increasingly popular in the last decade. Many of these platforms include recommender systems which aim to help users discover other people who will be also interested in them. These recommender systems benefit from contemplating the interest of both sides of the recommended match, however the question of how to optimally balance the interest and the response of both sides remains open. In this study we present a novel recommendation method for recommending people to people. For each user receiving a recommendation, our method finds the optimal balance of two criteria: a) the user’s likelihood to accept the recommendation; and b) the recommended user’s likelihood to positively respond. We extensively evaluate our recommendation method with a group of active users from an operational online dating site. We find that our method is significantly more effective in increasing the number of successful interactions compared to a current state-of-the-art recommendation method.</p>

    <h3>Getting the Timing Right: Leveraging Category Inter-purchase Times to Improve Recommender Systems (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Vuckovac, Alexander Ilic, Julia Wamsler, Martin Natter</p>
    <p>In the marketing domain, models of grocery buying behavior consider purchase incidence as a key dimension. However, in recommender systems, timing is often subsumed under contextual information and has received little attention yet. For this reason, we analyze the relation between the timing of a recommendation and its acceptance across different product categories. Our study is based on a real-world deployment of an in-store recommendation system in the brick-and-mortar grocery industry. We base our analysis on transaction data of more than 100,000 unique users and more than four million product recommendations. Our findings suggest that the success of a recommendation significantly depends on the inter-purchase time within the respective category. Different sensitivities across product categories further stress the importance of timing and its interplay with category characteristics within the context of recommender systems. The insights gained in this study enable retailers to improve scheduling recommendations and target promotions more efficiently.</p>
