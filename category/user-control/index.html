    <h3>Towards Companion Recommenders Assisting Users’ Long-Term Journeys (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minmin Chen, Konstantina Christakopoulou</p>
    <p>Nowadays, with the abundance of the internet content, users expect the recommendation platforms to not only help them with one-off decisions and short-term tasks, but to also support their persistent and overarching interest journeys, including their real-life goals that last days, months or even years. In order for recommender systems to truly assist users through their real-life journeys, they need to first be able to understand and reason about interests, needs, and goals users want to pursue; and then plan taking those into account. However, the task presents several challenges. In this talk, we will present the key steps and elements needed to tackle the problem — particularly (1) user research for interest journeys; (2) personalized and interpretable user profiles; (3) adapting large language models, and other foundational models, for better user understanding; (4) better planning at a macro-level through reinforcement learning and reason-and-act conversational agents; (5) novel journey-powered front end user experiences, allowing for more user control. We hope that the talk will help inspire other researchers, and will pave the way towards companion recommenders that can truly assist the users throughout their interest journeys.</p>

    <h3>ClusterExplorer: Enable User Control over Related Recommendations via Collaborative Filtering and Clustering (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kati Launis, Denis Kotkov, Mats Neovius, Qian Zhao</p>
    <p>Related item recommendations have a long history in recommender systems, but they tend to be a static list of similar items with respect to a target item of interest without any support of user control. In this paper, we propose ClusterExplorer, a novel approach for enabling user control over related recommendations. The approach allows users to explore the latent space of user-item interactions through controlling related recommendations. We evaluated ClusterExplorer in the book domain with 42 participants recruited in a public library and found that our approach has higher user satisfaction of browsing items and is more helpful in finding interesting items compared to traditional related item recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Exploring Recommendations Under User-Controlled Data Filtering (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longqi Yang, Deborah Estrin, Michael Sobolev, Hongyi Wen</p>
    <p>Traditionally, recommendation systems are built on the assumption that each service provider has full access to all user data generated on its platform. However, with increasing data privacy concerns and personal data protection regulation, service providers, such as Google, Twitter, and Facebook, are enabling their users to revisit, erase, and rectify their historical profiles. Future recommendation systems need to be robust to such profile modifications and user-controlled data filtering. In this paper, we explore how recommendation performance may be affected by time-sensitive user data filtering, i.e., users choosing to share only recent “N days” of data. Using the MovieLens dataset as a testbed, we evaluate three state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that filtering out historical user data does not significantly affect the overall recommendation performance, but its impact on individual users may vary. These findings challenge the common belief that more data produces better performance, and suggest a potential win-win solution for services and end users.</p>

    <h3>Recommender Popularity Controls: An Observational Study (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Maxwell Harper</p>
    <p>We describe an observational study of a recommender system that provides users with direct control over their personalization. Specifically, we allow users to tune a movie recommender towards more or less popular content. We report on 14 months of usage, which includes 6,846 users who visited the interface at least once. We find, surprisingly, that the popularity of items a user has interacted with historically is a poor predictor of their use of this interface.</p>

    <h3>HCI for Recommender Systems: the Past, the Present and the Future (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Ziefle, André Calero Valdez, Katrien Verbert</p>
    <p>How can you discover something new, that matches your interest? Recommender Systems have been studied since the 90ies. Their benefit comes from guiding a user through the density of the information jungle to useful knowledge clearings. Early research on recommender systems focuses on algorithms and their evaluation to improve recommendation accuracy using F-measures and other methodologies from signal-detection theory. Present research includes other aspects such as human factors that affect the user experience and interactive visualization techniques to support transparency of results and user control. In this paper, we analyze all publications on recommender systems from the scopus database, and particularly also papers with such an HCI focus. Based on an analysis of these papers, future topics for recommender systems research are identified, which include more advanced support for user control, adaptive interfaces, affective computing and applications in high risk domains.</p>

    <h3>Towards Understanding Latent Factors and User Profiles by Enhancing Matrix Factorization with Tags (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jürgen Ziegler, Tim Donkers, Benedikt Loepp</p>
    <p>With the interactive recommending approach we have recently proposed, users are given more control over model-based Collaborative Filtering while the results are perceived as more transparent. Integrating the latent factors derived by Matrix Factorization with tags users provided for the items has, however, even more advantages. In this paper, we show how general understanding of the abstract factor space, and of user and item positions inside it, can benefit from the semantics introduced by considering additional information. Moreover, our approach allows us to explain the user’s (former latent) preference profile by means of tags.</p>
