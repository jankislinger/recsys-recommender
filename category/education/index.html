    <h3>Understanding Fairness in Recommender Systems: A Healthcare Perspective (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veronica Kecki, Alan Said</p>
    <p>Fairness in AI-driven decision-making systems has become a critical concern, especially when these systems directly affect human lives. This paper explores the public’s comprehension of fairness in healthcare recommendations. We conducted a survey where participants selected from four fairness metrics – Demographic Parity, Equal Accuracy, Equalized Odds, and Positive Predictive Value – across different healthcare scenarios to assess their understanding of these concepts. Our findings reveal that fairness is a complex and often misunderstood concept, with a generally low level of public understanding regarding fairness metrics in recommender systems. This study highlights the need for enhanced information and education on algorithmic fairness to support informed decision-making in using these systems. Furthermore, the results suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach to fairness may be insufficient, pointing to the importance of context-sensitive designs in developing equitable AI systems.</p>

    <h3>Evaluation and simplification of text difficulty using LLMs in the context of recommending texts in French to facilitate language learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michalis Vlachos, Yash Raj Shrestha, Henri Jamet, Maxime Manderlier</p>
    <p>We develop a recommendation system for foreign language learning. This recommends text or video content. It ranks digital content considering both the content’s difficulty and how the topic aligns to the learners’ interests. To achieve this, we automatically apply the following operations to any text: a. Classify its subject. b. Evaluate its linguistic difficulty. c. Potentially simplify its language level, while preserving its semantic content for adaptation to the reader’s language level. Once these three operations have produced a set of texts adapted to the reader’s interests and level, they are ranked by relevance using a recommendation system based on the reading and satisfaction of other users. In this paper, we focus on using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically perform these tasks on any set of texts. We present an approach for training and evaluation and compare both zero-shot and fine-tuned performance of state-of-the-art models. Our findings indicate a marked improvement in the prediction of French content difficulty (improvement range of 18-56%), a 27% enhancement in topic prediction accuracy with fine-tuned models compared to zero-shot models, and up to an 18% increase in NDCG in recommendation performance.</p>

    <h3>Improving Recommender Systems Through the Automation of Design Decisions (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas Wegmeth</p>
    <p>Recommender systems developers are constantly faced with difficult design decisions. Additionally, the number of options that a recommender systems developer has to consider continually grows over time with new innovations. The machine learning community is in a similar situation and has come together to tackle the problem. They invented concepts and tools to make machine learning development both easier and faster. These developments are categorized as automated machine learning (AutoML). As a result, the AutoML community formed and continuously innovates new approaches. Inspired by AutoML, the recommender systems community has recently understood the need for automation and sparsely introduced AutoRecSys. The goal of AutoRecSys is not to replace recommender systems developers but to improve performance through the automation of design decisions. With AutoRecSys, recommender systems engineers do not have to focus on easy but time-consuming tasks and are free to pursue difficult engineering tasks instead. Additionally, AutoRecSys enables easier access to recommender systems for beginners as it reduces the amount of knowledge required to get started with the development of recommender systems. AutoRecSys, like AutoML, is still early in its development and does not yet cover the whole development pipeline. Additionally, it is not yet clear, under which circumstances AutoML approaches can be transferred to recommender systems. Our research intends to close this gap by improving AutoRecSys both with regard to the transfer of AutoML and novel approaches. Furthermore, we focus specifically on the development of novel automation approaches for data processing and training. We note that the realization of AutoRecSys is going to be a community effort. Our part in this effort is to research AutoRecSys fundamentals, build practical tools for the community, raise awareness of the advantages of automation, and catalyze AutoRecSys development.</p>

    <h3>A College Major Recommendation System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gary Weiss, Yiwen Chen, Daniel Leeds, Samuel Stein</p>
    <p>College students are required to select a major but are often provided with only a modest amount of support in making this important decision. A poor decision is detrimental to the student, since it may result in the student later switching to a different major with a delay in graduation—or even result in the student leaving the university. This also impacts the university since time to graduation and retention rate are used to evaluate the quality of a university. There is a general lack of research on recommender systems for college majors, with the most relevant systems focusing on course-level recommendations. This study describes and evaluates a recommender system for selecting an undergraduate major, utilizing nine years of historical student data from a large university. The system bases its recommendations on the courses that the student takes in the first few years of college, and how well they performed in these courses. The system is designed to recommend majors that the student is likely to be interested in and will perform well in. Recommendations are evaluated based on the likelihood that the student's actual major was in the top five recommended majors, and whether the student performed above average in that major. The recommendation system dramatically outperforms the baseline strategy of randomly selecting a major, and when the recommendation is followed the student is 12% more likely to perform above average in the major.</p>

    <h3>With a little help from my friends: use of recommendations at school (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theo Huibers, Emiliana Murgia, Maria Soledad Pera, Monica Landoni</p>
    <p>In this exploratory paper, we study the usage of recommendations by and for children (ages 9 to 11) in an educational setting. From our preliminary analysis, it becomes apparent that recommender systems (RS) could provide extra support to and help children successfully complete inquiry tasks. Nonetheless, children have difficulty in recognizing the role of RS, in terms of aiding information discovery for classroom assignments. Findings from our study set a foundation that can inform future design and development of RS for children that support classroom-related work.</p>

    <h3>Module Advisor: A Hybrid Recommender System for Elective Module Exploration (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael P. O’Mahony, Nina Hagemann, Barry Smyth</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are omni-present in our every day lives, guiding us through the vast amount of information available. However, in the academic world, personalised recommendations are less prominent, leaving students to navigate through the typically large space of available courses and modules manually. Since it is crucial for students to make informed choices about their learning pathways, we aim to improve the way students discover elective modules by developing a hybrid recommender system prototype that is specifically designed to help students find elective modules from a diverse set of subjects. We can improve the discoverability of long-tail options and help students broaden their horizons by combining notions of similarity and diversity.</p>

    <h3>A Recommender System for Personalized Exploration of Majors, Minors, and Concentrations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Young Park</p>
    <p>Many students change their majors during college. Choosing the right academic majors, minors, and concentrations within a major in higher education is challenging but crucial in assuring students’ overall academic and career success. Personalized prediction of student success in majors, minors, and concentrations will help students better find the right majors, minors, and concentrations for them, so as to timely achieve their academic goals. In this paper, we present a new recommender application for the academic major/minor/concentration selection problem in the educational domain. The proposed major/minor/concentration recommender system is a collaborative filtering-based recommender based on student grade prediction, and provides a variety of personalized predictions and recommendations on majors, minors, and concentrations. It is a useful tool to guide students, advisors, and administrators during the personalized major/minor/concentration exploration (declare/change) process.</p>

    <h3>Towards a Recommender System for Undergraduate Research (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Del Rio, Denis Parra, Erick Svec, Jovan Kuzmicic</p>
    <p>Several studies indicate that attracting students to research careers requires to engage them from early undergraduate years. Following this, the Engineering School at PUC Chile has developed an undergraduate research program that allows students to enroll in research in exchange for course credits. Moreover, we developed a web portal to inform students about the program, but participation remains lower than expected. In order to promote student engagement, we attempt to build a personalized recommender system of research opportunities to undergraduates. With this goal in mind we investigate two tasks. First, identifying students that are more willing to participate on this kind of program. A second task is generating a personalized list of recommendations of research opportunities for each student. To evaluate our approach, we perform a simulated prediction experiment with data from our school, which has more than 4,000 active undergraduate students nowadays. Results indicate that there is a big potential to create a personalized recommender system for this purpose. Our research can be used as a baseline for colleges seeking strategies to encourage research activities within undergraduate students.</p>

    <h3>Educational Question Routing in Online Student Communities (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Srba, Jakub Macina, Joseph Jay Williams, Maria Bielikova</p>
    <p>Students’ performance in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is enhanced by high quality discussion forums or recently emerging educational Community Question Answering (CQA) systems. Nevertheless, only a small number of students answer questions asked by their peers. This results in instructor overload, and many unanswered questions. To increase students’ participation, we present an approach for recommendation of new questions to students who are likely to provide answers. Existing approaches to such question routing proposed for non-educational CQA systems tend to rely on a few experts, which is not suitable because we want students to be engaged as it positively influences their learning outcomes. In tackling this novel educational question routing problem, our method (1) goes beyond previous question-answering data as it incorporate additional non-QA data from the course (to improve prediction accuracy and to involve a larger part of community) and (2) applies constraints on users’ workload (to prevent user overloading). We use an ensemble classifier for predicting students’ willingness to answer a question, as well as the students’ expertise for answering. We conducted an online evaluation of the proposed method using an A/B test in our CQA system deployed at an edX MOOC. The proposed method outperformed a baseline method (non-educational question routing enhanced with workload restriction) in recommendation accuracy, involving more community members, and average number of contributions.</p>

    <h3>rrecsys: an R-package for prototyping recommendation algorithms (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Zanker, Ludovik Çoba</p>
    <p>We introduce rrecsys, an open source extension package in R for rapid prototyping and intuitive assessment of recommender system algorithms. As the only currently available R package for recommender algorithms (recommenderlab) did not include popular algorithm implementations such as matrix factorization or One-class Collaborative Filtering algorithms we developed rrecsys as an easily accessible tool that can, for instance, be employed for interactive demonstrations when teaching. This package replicates state-of-the-art Collaborative Filtering algorithms for rating and binary data and we compare results with the Java-based LensKit implementation and recommederlab for the purpose of benchmarking the implementation. Therefore this work can also be seen as a contribution in the context of replication of algorithm implementations and reproduction of evaluation results.</p>

    <h3>Domain-Aware Grade Prediction and Top-n Course Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> George Karypis, Asmaa Elbadrawy</p>
    <p>Automated course recommendation can help deliver personalized and effective college advising and degree planning. Nearest neighbor and matrix factorization based collaborative filtering approaches have been applied to student-course grade data to help students select suitable courses. However, the student-course enrollment patterns exhibit grouping structures that are tied to the student and course academic features, which lead to grade data that are not missing at random (NMAR). Existing approaches for dealing with NMAR data, such as Response-aware and context-aware matrix factorization, do not model NMAR data in terms of the user and item features and are not designed with the characteristics of grade data in mind. In this work we investigate how the student and course academic features influence the enrollment patterns and we use these features to define student and course groups at various levels of granularity. We show how these groups can be used to design grade prediction and top-n course ranking models for neighborhood-based user collaborative filtering, matrix factorization and popularity-based ranking approaches. These methods give lower grade prediction error and more accurate top-n course rankings than the other methods that do not take domain knowledge into account.</p>
