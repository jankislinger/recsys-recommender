    <h3>On Interpretability of Linear Autoencoders (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ladislav Peska, Martin Spišák, Radek Bartyzal, Antonín Hoskovec</p>
    <p>We derive a novel graph-based interpretation of linear autoencoder models EASE, SLIM, and their approximate variants. Contrary to popular belief, we reveal that the weights of these models should not be interpreted as dichotomic item similarity but merely as its magnitude. Consequently, we propose a simple modification that considerably improves retrieval ability in sparse domains and yields interpretable inference with negative inputs, as demonstrated by our offline and online experiments.</p>

    <h3>Pairwise Intent Graph Embedding Learning for Context-Aware Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhao Wu, Zhong Ming, Xiaolian Zhang, Hao Wang, Qinjuan Yang, Dugang Liu, Weixin Li</p>
    <p>Although knowledge graph have shown their effectiveness in mitigating data sparsity in many recommendation tasks, they remain underutilized in context-aware recommender systems (CARS) with the specific sparsity challenges associated with the contextual features, i.e., feature sparsity and interaction sparsity. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel pairwise intent graph embedding learning (PING) framework to efficiently integrate knowledge graph into CARS. Specifically, our PING contains three modules: 1) a graph construction module is used to obtain a pairwise intent graph (PIG) containing nodes for users, items, entities and enhanced intent, where enhanced intent nodes are generated by applying user intent fusion (UIF) on relational intent and contextual intent, and two sub-intents are derived from the semantic information and contextual information, respectively; 2) a pairwise intent joint graph convolution module is used to obtain the refined embeddings of all the features by executing a customized convolution strategy on PIG, where each enhanced intent node acts as a hub to efficiently propagate information among different features and between all the features and knowledge graph; 3) a recommendation module with the refined embeddings is used to replace the randomly initialized embeddings of downstream recommendation models to improve model performance. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to verify the effectiveness and compatibility of our PING.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Global Sensitivity for Differentially Private Contextual Bandits (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongning Wang, David B. Zhao, Huazheng Wang</p>
    <p>Bandit algorithms have become a reference solution for interactive recommendation. However, as such algorithms directly interact with users for improved recommendations, serious privacy concerns have been raised regarding its practical use. In this work, we propose a differentially private linear contextual bandit algorithm, via a tree-based mechanism to add Laplace or Gaussian noise to model parameters. Our key insight is that as the model converges during online update, the global sensitivity of its parameters shrinks over time (thus named dynamic global sensitivity). Compared with existing solutions, our dynamic global sensitivity analysis allows us to inject less noise to obtain (ϵ, δ)-differential privacy with added regret caused by noise injection in . We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis over the amount of noise added via dynamic global sensitivity and the corresponding upper regret bound of our proposed algorithm. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets confirmed the algorithm’s advantage against existing solutions.</p>
