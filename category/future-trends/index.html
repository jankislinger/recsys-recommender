    <h3>Trending Now: Modeling Trend Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anoop Deoras, Venkataramana Kini, Hao Wang, Yupeng Gu, Fei Wang, Youngsuk Park, Ravi Divvela, Yifei Ma, Branislav Kveton, Hao Ding</p>
    <p>Modern recommender systems usually include separate recommendation carousels such as ‘trending now’ to list trending items and further boost their popularity, thereby attracting active users. Though widely useful, such ‘trending now‘ carousels typically generate item lists based on simple heuristics, e.g., the number of interactions within a time interval, and therefore still leave much room for improvement. This paper aims to systematically study this under-explored but important problem from the new perspective of time series forecasting. We first provide a set of rigorous definitions related to item trendiness with associated evaluation protocols, and then propose a deep latent variable model, dubbed Trend Recommender (TrendRec), to forecast items’ future trend and generate trending item lists. Experiments on real-world datasets from various domains show that our TrendRec significantly outperforms the baselines, verifying our model’s effectiveness.</p>

    <h3>Past, Present, and Future of Recommender Systems: An Industry Perspective (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Justin Basilico, Xavier Amatriain</p>
    <p>When the Netflix Prize launched in 2006, it put a spotlight on the importance and use of recommender systems in real-world applications. The competition provided many lessons, and many more have been learned since the Grand Prize was awarded in 2009. The use of recommender systems in industry has continued to grow driven by the availability of many kinds of user data and the continued interest for the area within the research community. In this paper, we will describe what we see as the past, present, and future of recommender systems from an industry perspective.</p>

    <h3>Recommender Systems with Personality (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amos Azaria, Jason Hong</p>
    <p>We believe that in the future, the most common form of recommender systems will be present in a personal assistant. We claim that such an intelligent agent must be personal, i.e., know its user’s preferences and recommend relevant content, a dynamic learner, instructable, supportive and affable. We describe the current state of the art and the challenges which should be addressed in each of these agent properties and provide examples of how we expect future personal agents to convey these properties.</p>
