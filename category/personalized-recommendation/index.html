    <h3>User knowledge prompt for sequential recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuuki Tachioka</p>
    <p>The large language model (LLM) based recommendation system is effective for sequential recommendation, because general knowledge of popular items is included in the LLM. To add domain knowledge of items, the conventional method uses a knowledge prompt obtained from the item knowledge graphs and has achieved SOTA performance. However, for personalized recommendation, it is necessary to consider user knowledge, which the conventional method does not fully consider because user knowledge is not included in the item knowledge graphs; thus, we propose a user knowledge prompt, which converts a user knowledge graph into a prompt using the relationship template. The existing prompt denoising framework is extended to prevent hallucination caused by undesirable interactions between knowledge graph prompts. We propose user knowledge prompts of user traits and user preferences and associate relevant items. Experiments on three types of dataset (movie, music, and book) show the significant and consistent improvement of our proposed user knowledge prompt.</p>

    <h3>Progressive Horizon Learning: Adaptive Long Term Optimization for Personalized Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Ni, Shreya Chakrabarti, Congrui Yi, David Zumwalt</p>
    <p>As B2C companies such as Amazon, Netflix, Spotify scale, personalized recommender systems are often needed to further drive long term business growth in acquisition, engagement, and retention of customers. However, long-term metrics associated with these goals can require several months to mature. Additionally, deep personalization also demands a large volume of training data that take a long time to collect. These factors incur substantial lead time for training a model to optimize a long-term metric. Before such model is deployed, a recommender system has to rely on a simple policy (e.g. random) to collect customer feedback data for training, inflicting high opportunity cost and delaying optimization of the target metric. Besides, as customer preferences can shift over time, a large temporal gap between inputs and outcome poses a high risk of data staleness and suboptimal learning. Existing approaches involve various compromises. For instance, contextual bandits often optimize short-term surrogate metrics with simple model structure, which can be suboptimal in the long run, while Reinforcement Learning approaches rely on an abundance of historical data for offline training, which essentially means long lead time before deployment. To address these problems, we propose Progressive Horizon Learning Recommender (PHLRec), a personalized model that can progressively learn metric patterns and adaptively evolve from short- to long-term optimization over time. Through simulations and real data experiments, we demonstrated that PHLRec outperforms competing methods, achieving optimality in both deployment speed and long-term metric performances.</p>

    <h3>Adaptive Pointwise-Pairwise Learning-to-Rank for Content-based Personalized Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Michel Renders, Yagmur Gizem Cinar</p>
    <p>This paper extends the standard pointwise and pairwise paradigms for learning-to-rank in the context of personalized recommendation, by considering these two approaches as two extremes of a continuum of possible strategies. It basically consists of a surrogate loss that models how to select and combine these two approaches adaptively, depending on the context (query or user, pair of items, etc.). In other words, given a training instance, which is typically a triplet (a query/user and two items with different preferences or relevance grades), the strategy adaptively determines whether it is better to focus on the “most preferred” item (pointwise - positive instance), on the “less preferred” one (pointwise - negative instance) or on the pair (pairwise), or on anything else in between these 3 extreme alternatives. We formulate this adaptive strategy as minimizing a particular loss function that generalizes simultaneously the traditional pointwise and pairwise loss functions (negative log-likelihood) through a mixture coefficient. This coefficient is formulated as a learnable function of the features associated to the triplet. Experimental results on several real-world news recommendation datasets show clear improvements over several pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches.</p>

    <h3>Aesthetic Features for Personalized Photo Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Putra Manggala, Ga Wu, Yu Qing Zhou, Scott Sanner</p>
    <p>Many photography websites such as Flickr, 500px, Unsplash, and Adobe Behance are used by amateur and professional photography enthusiasts. Unlike content-based image search, such users of photography websites are not just looking for photos with certain content, but more generally for photos with a certain photographic “aesthetic”. In this context, we explore personalized photo recommendation and propose two aesthetic feature extraction methods based on (i) color space and (ii) deep style transfer embeddings. Using a dataset from 500px, we evaluate how these features can be best leveraged by collaborative filtering methods and show that (ii) provides a significant boost in photo recommendation performance.</p>

    <h3>Ensemble Contextual Bandits for Personalized Recommendation (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Li, Lei Li, Yexi Jiang, Liang Tang</p>
    <p>The cold-start problem has attracted extensive attention among various online services that provide personalized recommendation. Many online vendors employ contextual bandit strategies to tackle the so-called exploration/exploitation dilemma rooted from the cold-start problem. However, due to high-dimensional user/item features and the underlying characteristics of bandit policies, it is often difficult for service providers to obtain and deploy an appropriate algorithm to achieve acceptable and robust economic profit. In this paper, we explore ensemble strategies of multiple contextual bandit algorithms to obtain robust predicted click-through rate (CTR) of web objects. Specifically, the ensemble is acquired by aggregating different pulling policies of bandit algorithms, rather than forcing the agreement of prediction results or learning a unified predictive model. To this end, we employ a meta-bandit paradigm that places a hyper bandit over the base bandits, to explicitly explore/exploit the relative importance of base bandits based on user feedbacks. Extensive empirical experiments on two real-world data sets (news recommendation and online advertising) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of CTR.</p>
