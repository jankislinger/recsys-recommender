    <h3>AutoRec: An Automated Recommender System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingquan Song, Xiaotian Han, Xia Hu, Zirui Liu, Haifeng Jin, Ting-Hsiang Wang</p>
    <p>Realistic recommender systems are often required to adapt to ever-changing data and tasks or to explore different models systematically. To address the need, we present AutoRec  1  2, an open-source automated machine learning (AutoML) platform extended from the TensorFlow [3] ecosystem and, to our knowledge, the first framework to leverage AutoML for model search and hyperparameter tuning in deep recommendation models. AutoRec also supports a highly flexible pipeline that accommodates both sparse and dense inputs, rating prediction and click-through rate (CTR) prediction tasks, and an array of recommendation models. Lastly, AutoRec provides a simple, user-friendly API. Experiments conducted on the benchmark datasets reveal AutoRec is reliable and can identify models which resemble the best model without prior knowledge.</p>

    <h3>Kernelized Probabilistic Matrix Factorization for Collaborative Filtering: Exploiting Projected User and Item Graph (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bithika Pal, Mamata Jenamani</p>
    <p>Matrix Factorization (MF) techniques have already shown its strong foundation in collaborative filtering (CF), particularly for rating prediction problem. MF models mainly work as low-rank matrix completion problem by mapping the users and items into same low dimensional latent space. In this direction, now-a-days, a majority of the studies have focused on using additional information such as social network, item tags along with rating to mitigate different issues in the basic recommendation. This results in making the model more complex with a very specific target. However, there are very few studies in recent years which use only users rating information for the recommendation. In this paper, we present a new finding on exploiting Projected User and Item Graph in the setting of Kernelized Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (KPMF), which uses different graph kernel from the projected graphs. KPMF, here, works with its latent vector spanning over all users (and items) with Gaussian process priors and tries to capture the covariance structure across users and items from the projected graphs. We also explore the ways of building these projected graphs maintaining some properties to maximize the prediction accuracy. We implement the model in four real-world datasets and compare the results with state-of-the-art MF techniques. Using projected graph in KPMF, we achieve significant improvement in RMSE using only rating information of users.</p>

    <h3>Neural Gaussian Mixture Model for Review-based Rating Prediction (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haofei Zhou, Jian Yu, Dong Deng, Liping Jing, Sun Shaolong</p>
    <p>Reviews has been proven to be an important information in recommendation. Different from the overall user-item rating matrix, it can provide textual information that exhibits why a user likes an item or not. Recently, more and more researchers have paid attention on review-based rating prediction. There are two challenging issues: how to extract representative features to characterize users / items from reviews and how to leverage them for recommendation system. In this paper, we propose a Neural Gaussian Mixture Model for review-based rating prediction task (NGMM). Among it, the textual review information is used to construct two parallel neural networks for users and items respectively, so that the users’ preferences and items’ properties can be sufficiently extracted and written as two latent vectors. A shared layer is introduced on the top to couple these two networks together and model user-item rating based on the features learned from reviews. Specifically, each rating is modeled via a Gaussian mixture model, where each Gaussian component has zero variance, the mean described by the corresponding component in user’s latent vector and the weight indicated by the corresponding component in item’s latent vector. Extensive experiments are conducted on five real-world Amazon review datasets. The experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed NGMM model achieves the state-of-the-art performance in review-based rating prediction task.</p>

    <h3>Interpretable Convolutional Neural Networks with Dual Local and Global Attention for Review Rating Prediction (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing Huang, Sungyong Seo, Hao Yang, Yan Liu</p>
    <p>Recently, many e-commerce websites have encouraged their users to rate shopping items and write review text. This review text information has been very useful for understanding user preferences and item properties and it enhances the capability to make personalized recommendations of these websites. In this paper, we propose to model user preferences and item properties using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with dual local and global attention, motivated by the superiority of CNNs to extract complex features. By using aggregated review text from a user and aggregated review text for an item, our model can learn the unique features (embedding) of each user and each item. These features are then used to predict ratings. We train these user and item networks jointly and this enables the interaction between users and items in a similar way to matrix factorization. The local attention gives us insight on a user’s preferences or an item’s properties. The global attention helps CNNs focus on semantic meanings of the whole review text. Thus, the combined local and global attentions enable an interpretable and better-learned representation of users and items. We validate the proposed models by applying popular review datasets in Yelp and Amazon and compare the results with matrix factorization (MF), the hidden factors as topics (HFT) model, and the recently proposed convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF+). The proposed CNNs with dual attention model outperforms HFT and ConvMF+ in terms of mean square errors (MSE). In addition, we compare the user/item embeddings learned from these models for classification and recommendation. These results also confirm the superior quality of user/item embeddings learned from our model.</p>

    <h3>Are You Influenced by Others When Rating? Improve Rating Prediction by Conformity Modeling (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yong Yu, Xuezhi Cao, Yiming Liu</p>
    <p>Conformity has a strong influence to user behaviors, even in online environment. When surfing online, users are usually flooded with others’ opinions. These opinions implicitly contribute to the user’s ongoing behaviors. However, there is no research work modeling online conformity yet. In this paper, we model user’s conformity in online rating sites. We conduct analysis using real data to show the existence and strength of conformity in these scenarios. We propose a matrix-factorization-based conformity modeling technique to improve the accuracy of rating prediction. Experiments show that our model outperforms existing works significantly (with a relative improvement of 11.72% on RMSE). Therefore, we draw the conclusion that conformity modeling is important for understanding user behaviors and can contribute to further improve the online recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Efficient Bayesian Methods for Graph-based Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrygo L. T. Santos, Renato Assunção, Ramon Lopes</p>
    <p>Short-length random walks on the bipartite user-item graph have recently been shown to provide accurate and diverse recommendations. Nonetheless, these approaches suffer from severe time and space requirements, which can be alleviated via random walk sampling, at the cost of reduced recommendation quality. In addition, these approaches ignore users’ ratings, which further limits their expressiveness. In this paper, we introduce a computationally efficient graph-based approach for collaborative filtering based on short-path enumeration. Moreover, we propose three scoring functions based on the Bayesian paradigm that effectively exploit distributional aspects of the users’ ratings. We experiment with seven publicly available datasets against state-of-the-art graph-based and matrix factorization approaches. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant improvements in most settings. Furthermore, analytical results demonstrate its efficiency compared to other graph-based approaches.</p>

    <h3>Latent Trajectory Modeling: A Light and Efficient Way to Introduce Time in Recommender Systems (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Gallinari, Vincent Guigue, Elie Guàrdia-Sebaoun</p>
    <p>For recommender systems, time is often an important source of information but it is also a complex dimension to apprehend. We propose here to learn item and user representations such that any timely ordered sequence of items selected by a user will be represented as a trajectory of the user in a representation space. This allows us to rank new items for this user. We then enrich the item and user representations in order to perform rating prediction using a classical matrix factorization scheme. We demonstrate the interest of our approach regarding both item ranking and rating prediction on a series of classical benchmarks.</p>

    <h3>Overlapping Community Regularization for Rating Prediction in Social Recommender Systems (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dingming Wu, Nikos Mamoulis, Wenbin Tang, Hui Li</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have become de facto tools for suggesting items that are of potential interest to users. Predicting a user’s rating on an item is the fundamental recommendation task. Traditional methods that generate predictions by analyzing the user-item rating matrix perform poorly when the matrix is sparse. Recent approaches use data from social networks to improve accuracy. However, most of the social-network based recommender systems only consider direct friendships and they are less effective when the targeted user has few social connections. In this paper, we propose two alternative models that incorporate the overlapping community regularization into the matrix factorization framework. Our empirical study on four real datasets shows that our approaches outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in both traditional and social-network based recommender systems regarding both cold-start users and normal users.</p>

    <h3>Implicit vs. Explicit Trust in Social Matrix Factorization (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Bellogin, Peter Sloep, Hendrik Drachsler, Babak Loni, Soude Fazeli</p>
    <p>Incorporating social trust in Matrix Factorization (MF) methods demonstrably improves accuracy of rating prediction. Such approaches mainly use the trust scores explicitly expressed by users. However, it is often challenging to have users provide explicit trust scores of each other. There exist quite a few works, which propose Trust Metrics (TM) to compute and predict trust scores between users based on their interactions. In this paper, we first evaluate several TMs to find out which one can best predict trust scores compared to the actual trust scores explicitly expressed by users. And, second, we propose to incorporate these trust scores inferred from the candidate implicit TMs into social matrix factorization (MF). We investigate if incorporating the implicit trust scores in MF can make rating prediction as accurate as the MF on explicit trust scores. The reported results support the idea of employing implicit trust into MF whenever explicit trust is not available, since the performance of both models is similar.</p>

    <h3>Bayesian Binomial Mixture Model for Collaborative Prediction with Non-Random Missing Data (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seungjin Choi, Yong-Deok Kim</p>
    <p>In real-world datasets, the presence of a certain amount of missing data is inevitable. If the data is not missing at random (MAR), the missing mechanism can not be ignored, and has to be modelled precisely as to obtain correct results. However, although there are strong possibilities of violation of MAR assumption on rating datasets collected from recommendation systems, most prior researches on collaborative prediction ignore the missing data mechanism. Exceptions are recent works on multinomial mixture model with CPT-v and Logit-vd, which employ conditional Bernoulli selection models for the response variables. In this paper, we present a Bayesian binomial mixture model for collaborative prediction with non-random missing data. We consider three factors for reason of observation: user, item, and rating value. Each factor is modelled by Bernoulli random variable, and the observation of rating is determined by the OR operation of three binary variables. Because of the property of OR operation, one of three factors can override others, hence it naturally models the 80-20 rule, which commonly arise in the recommendation systems. We develop efficient variational inference algorithms with closed-form update rules for all variational parameters, where the computational complexity depends on the number of observation, not on the size of the rating data matrix. Finally, we present experimental results showing that 1) binomial mixture model is more suitable than multinomial mixture model for modelling discrete, finite, and ordered rating values; 2) our model find meaningful solutions instead of boundary solutions, if hyper-parameters are estimated by empirical Bayes; 3) our model can capture different rating trend between domain (e.g. songs and movies).</p>
