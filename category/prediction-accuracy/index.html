    <h3>A Crowdsourcing Triage Algorithm for Geopolitical Forecasting (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Huber, Tsai-Ching Lu, Mohammad Rostami</p>
    <p>Predicting the outcome of geopolitical events is of huge importance to many organizations, as these forecasts provide actionable intelligence that may be used to make consequential decisions. Prediction polling is a common method used in crowdsourcing platforms for geopolitical forecasting, where a group of non-expert participants are asked to predict the outcome of a geopolitical event and the collected responses are aggregated to generate a forecast. It has been demonstrated that forecasts by such a crowd can be more accurate than the forecasts of experts. However, geopolitical prediction polling is challenging because participants are highly heterogeneous and diverse in terms of their skills and background knowledge and human resources are often limited. As a result, it is crucial to refer each question to the subset of participants that possess suitable skills to answer it, such that individual efforts are not wasted. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on multitask learning to learn the skills of participants of a forecasting platform by using their performance history. The learned model then can be used to recommend suitable questions to forecasters. Our experimental results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy can be increased based on the proposed algorithm as opposed to when questions have been randomly assigned.</p>

    <h3>Modeling the Assimilation-Contrast Effects in Online Product Rating Systems: Debiasing and Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junzhou Zhao, Xiaoying Zhang, John C.S. Lui</p>
    <p>The unbiasedness of online product ratings, an important property to ensure that users’ ratings indeed reflect their true evaluations to products, is vital both in shaping consumer purchase decisions and providing reliable recommendations. Recent experimental studies showed that distortions from historical ratings would ruin the unbiasedness of subsequent ratings. How to “discover” the distortions from historical ratings in each single rating (or at the micro-level), and perform the “de-biasing operations” in real rating systems are the main objectives of this work. Using 42 million real customer ratings, we first show that users either “assimilate” or “contrast” to historical ratings under different scenarios: users conform to historical ratings if historical ratings are not far from the product quality (assimilation), while users deviate from historical ratings if they are significantly different from the product quality (contrast). This phenomenon can be explained by the well-known psychological argument: the “Assimilate-Contrast” theory. However, none of the existing works on modeling historical ratings’ influence have taken this into account, and this motivates us to propose the Historical Influence Aware Latent Factor Model (HIALF), the first model for real rating systems to capture and mitigate historical distortions in each single rating. HIALF also allows us to study the influence patterns of historical ratings from a modeling perspective, and it perfectly matches the assimilation and contrast effects we previously observed. Also, HIALF achieves significant improvements in predicting subsequent ratings, and accurately predicts the relationships revealed in previous empirical measurements on real ratings. Finally, we show that HIALF can contribute to better recommendations by decoupling users’ real preference from distorted ratings, and reveal the intrinsic product quality for wiser consumer purchase decisions.</p>

    <h3>Ratings Meet Reviews, a Combined Approach to Recommend (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guang Ling, Irwin King, Michael Lyu</p>
    <p>Most existing recommender systems focus on modeling the ratings while ignoring the abundant information embedded in the review text. In this paper, we propose a unified model that combines content-based filtering with collaborative filtering, harnessing the information of both ratings and reviews. We apply topic modeling techniques on the review text and align the topics with rating dimensions to improve prediction accuracy. With the information embedded in the review text, we can alleviate the cold-start problem. Furthermore, our model is able to learn latent topics that are interpretable. With these interpretable topics, we can explore the prior knowledge on items or users and recommend completely “cold” items. Empirical study on 27 classes of real-life datasets show that our proposed model lead to significant improvement compared with strong baseline methods, especially for datasets which are extremely sparse where rating-only methods cannot make accurate predictions.</p>
