    <h3>Towards Understanding The Gaps of Offline And Online Evaluation Metrics: Impact of Series vs. Movie Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashok Chandrashekar, Puja Das, Bora Edizel, Tim Sweetser, Kamilia Ahmadi</p>
    <p>In the realm of recommender systems research, offline evaluation metrics like NDCG, Recall, or Precision are often used to measure the impact. On the other hand, common industry practices suggest evaluating new ideas/models through A/B tests where decisions are made based on business metrics like the overall engagement of users. A new model may show improvement in offline metrics but performance loss in online metrics. One reason that leads to this phenomenon is the counterfactual nature of the recommendation problem which can be addressed by off-policy evaluation methods. Another reason is the degree of causal connection between offline evaluation metrics and observed online metrics. In this work, we will share our learnings from two sets of A/B tests that we conducted at Max1 where we observed a mismatch between online and offline metrics due to a weak causal connection between online and offline metrics. Thanks to learnings from A/B tests, we discovered and quantified the impact of series to movie ratio at recommendations. Our experiments show that there is an optimal amount of series to movies ratio that provides the best possible results for user engagement</p>

    <h3>Multi-Preview Recommendation via Reinforcement Learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuan-Ting Lai, Pengcheng Xiong, Zhong Wu, Yang Xu</p>
    <p>Preview recommendations serve as a crucial shortcut for attracting users’ attention on various systems, platforms, and webpages, significantly boosting user engagement. However, the variability of preview types and the flexibility of preview duration make it challenging to use an integrated framework for multi-preview recommendations under resource constraints. In this paper, we present an approach that incorporates constrained Q-learning into a notification recommendation system, effectively handling both multi-preview ranking and duration orchestration by targeting long-term user retention. Our method bridges the gap between combinatorial reinforcement learning, which often remains too theoretical for practical use, and segmented modules in production, where model performance is typically compromised due to over-simplification. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach through off-policy evaluation and online A/B testing using Microsoft data.</p>

    <h3>“More to Read” at the Los Angeles Times: Solving a Cold Start Problem with LLMs to Improve Story Discovery (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Kaufman, Franklin Horn, Aurelia Alston, Won You</p>
    <p>News publishers, who are seeking to grow their digital audience, face a challenge in providing relevant content recommendations for unregistered users arriving directly to article pages. In these cold start scenarios, classic techniques, like asking a user to register and select topics of interest, fall short. We present a contextual targeting approach that leverages the user’s current article choice itself as an implicit signal of user interests. We designed and developed an interface with recommendations to help users discover more articles. Our online A/B testing demonstrated that our models increased click-through rates by 39.4% over a popularity baseline. One of them, a large language model (LLM), generates relevant recommendations that balance immersion and novelty. We discuss the implications of using LLMs for responsibly enhancing user experiences while upholding editorial standards. We identify key opportunities in detecting nuanced user preferences and identifying and interrupting filter bubbles on news publisher sites.</p>

    <h3>Optimizing for Participation in Recommender System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourabh Bansod, Yaping Zhang, Bibang Liu, Mingyan Gao, Yuan Shao, Arnab Bhadury</p>
    <p>The traditional recommender system has been designed to mostly optimize for viewer consumption, and with the rise of short form videos, the boundaries between consumption and participation have blurred. This shift presents an opportunity to optimize recommender systems not only for passive consumption, but also for active participation in content creation. In this paper, we document the development of a recommender system that provides inspiration to existing content uploaders and new future content uploaders to encourage participation. Our contributions are two-fold: 1) Inspiration Framework: We present a novel framework for building a recommender system that goes beyond traditional consumption-focused metrics, specifically addressing the need for creative inspiration to lower barriers for participation. This framework is adaptable in the design of large-scale recommender systems in other domains. 2) Empirical Evaluation: We conduct systematic evaluation via live experiments to prove the values of the proposed system in increasing daily participation and participants.</p>

    <h3>What We Evaluate When We Evaluate Recommender Systems: Understanding Recommender Systems’ Performance using Item Response Theory (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Liu, Alan Medlar, Dorota Glowacka</p>
    <p>Current practices in offline evaluation use rank-based metrics to measure the quality of recommendation lists. This approach has practical benefits as it centers assessment on the output of the recommender system and, therefore, measures performance from the perspective of end-users. However, this methodology neglects how recommender systems more broadly model user preferences, which is not captured by only considering the top-n recommendations. In this article, we use item response theory (IRT), a family of latent variable models used in psychometric assessment, to gain a comprehensive understanding of offline evaluation. We used IRT to jointly estimate the latent abilities of 51 recommendation algorithms and the characteristics of 3 commonly used benchmark data sets. For all data sets, the latent abilities estimated by IRT suggest that higher scores from traditional rank-based metrics do not reflect improvements in modeling user preferences. Furthermore, we show the top-n recommendations with the most discriminatory power are biased towards lower difficulty items, leaving much room for improvement. Lastly, we highlight the role of popularity in evaluation by investigating how user engagement and item popularity influence recommendation difficulty.</p>

    <h3>Reward innovation for long-term member satisfaction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiangwei Pan, Henry Wang, Gary Tang, Justin Basilico</p>
    <p>Many large-scale recommender systems train on engagements because of their data abundance, immediacy of feedback, and correlation to user preferences. At Netflix and many digital products, engagement is an imperfect proxy to the overall goal of long-term user satisfaction. One way we address this misalignment is via reward innovation. In this paper, we provide a high-level description of the problem and motivate our approach. Finally, we present some practical insights into this track of work including challenges, lessons learned, and systems we’ve built to support the effort.</p>

    <h3>Track Mix Generation on Music Streaming Services using Transformers (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Bouabça, Walid Bendada, Benjamin Chapus, Thibault Cador, Théo Bontempelli, Mathieu Morlon, Guillaume Salha-Galvan</p>
    <p>This paper introduces Track Mix, a personalized playlist generation system released in 2022 on the music streaming service Deezer. Track Mix automatically generates “mix” playlists inspired by initial music tracks, allowing users to discover music similar to their favorite content. To generate these mixes, we consider a Transformer model trained on millions of track sequences from user playlists. In light of the growing popularity of Transformers in recent years, we analyze the advantages, drawbacks, and technical challenges of using such a model for mix generation on the service, compared to a more traditional collaborative filtering approach. Since its release, Track Mix has been generating playlists for millions of users daily, enhancing their music discovery experience on Deezer.</p>

    <h3>A Probabilistic Position Bias Model for Short-Video Recommendation Feeds (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Jeunen</p>
    <p>Modern web-based platforms often show ranked lists of recommendations to users, in an attempt to maximise user satisfaction or business metrics. Typically, the goal of such systems boils down to maximising the exposure probability — conversely, minimising the rank— for items that are deemed “reward-maximising” according to some metric of interest. This general framing comprises music or movie streaming applications, as well as e-commerce, restaurant or job recommendations, and even web search. Position bias or user models can be used to estimate exposure probabilities for each use-case, specifically tailored to how users interact with the presented rankings. A unifying factor in these diverse problem settings is that typically only one or several items will be engaged with (clicked, streamed, purchased, et cetera) before a user leaves the ranked list.  Short-video feeds on social media platforms diverge from this general framing in several ways, most notably that users do not tend to leave the feed after, for example, liking a post. Indeed, seemingly infinite feeds invite users to scroll further down the ranked list. For this reason, existing position bias or user models tend to fall short in such settings, as they do not accurately capture users’ interaction modalities. In this work, we propose a novel and probabilistically sound personalised position bias model for feed recommendations. We focus on a 1st-level feed in a hierarchical structure, where users may enter a 2nd-level feed via any given 1st-level item. We posit that users come to the platform with a given scrolling budget that is drawn according to a discrete power-law distribution, and show how the survival function of said distribution can be used to obtain closed-form estimates for personalised exposure probabilities. Empirical insights gained through data from a large-scale social media platform show how our probabilistic position bias model more accurately captures empirical exposure than existing models, and paves the way for improved unbiased evaluation and learning-to-rank.</p>

    <h3>Two-Layer Bandit Optimization for Recommendations (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Humeyra Topcu Altintas, Puja Das, Aaron Chen, Sofia Maria Nikolakaki, Siyong Ma</p>
    <p>Online commercial app marketplaces serve millions of apps to billions of users in an efficient manner. Bandit optimization algorithms are used to ensure that the recommendations are relevant, and converge to the best performing content over time. However, directly applying bandits to real-world systems, where the catalog of items is dynamic and continuously refreshed, is not straightforward. One of the challenges we face is the existence of several competing content surfacing components, a phenomenon not unusual in large-scale recommender systems. This often leads to challenging scenarios, where improving the recommendations in one component can lead to performance degradation of another, i.e., “cannibalization”. To address this problem we introduce an efficient two-layer bandit approach which is contextualized to user cohorts of similar taste. We mitigate cannibalization at runtime within a single multi-intent content surfacing platform by formalizing relevant offline evaluation metrics, and by involving the cross-component interactions in the bandit rewards. The user engagement in our proposed system has more than doubled as measured by online A/B testings.</p>

    <p>At Peloton, we are challenged to not just surface relevant recommendations of fitness classes to our members, but also timely ones. As our fitness content library expands, we continually produce classes on certain themes which are most timely during a narrow time window. To address this challenge, we provide some control over our recommendations to external stakeholders, such as production and marketing teams. They enter timed boosts of certain classes during the windows they are relevant in. We have built out algorithms which take these desired classes and elevate the number of impressions for them, while preserving members’ engagement with our recommendations. In this paper, we discuss the system, the algorithms and some results from a few A/B tests showing how boosting works in practice.</p>

    <h3>Discovery Dynamics: Leveraging Repeated Exposure for User and Music Characterization (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Sguerra, Viet-Anh Tran, Romain Hennequin</p>
    <p>Repetition in music consumption is a common phenomenon. It is notably more frequent when compared to the consumption of other media, such as books and movies. In this paper, we show that one particularly interesting repetitive behavior arises when users are consuming new items. Users’ interest tends to rise with the first repetitions and attains a peak after which interest will decrease with subsequent exposures, resulting in an inverted-U shape. This behavior, which has been extensively studied in psychology, is called the mere exposure effect. In this paper, we show how a number of factors, both content and user-based, well documented in the literature on the mere exposure effect, modulate the magnitude of the effect. Due to the vast availability of data of users discovering new songs everyday in music streaming platforms, this findings enable new ways to characterize both the music, users and their relationships. Ultimately, it opens up the possibility of developing new recommender systems paradigms based on these characterizations.</p>

    <h3>Recommending for a Multi-Sided Marketplace with Heterogeneous Contents (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian Xing Zhang, Yuyan Wang, Long Tao</p>
    <p>Many online personalization platforms today are recommending heterogeneous contents in a multi-sided marketplace consisting of consumers, merchants and other partners. For a recommender system to be successful in these contexts, it faces two main challenges. First, each side in the marketplace has different and potentially conflicting utilities. Recommending for a multi-sided marketplace therefore entails jointly optimizing multiple objectives with trade-offs. Second, the off-the-shelf recommendation algorithms are not applicable to the heterogeneous content space, where a recommendation item could be an aggregation of other recommendation items. In this work, we develop a general framework for recommender systems in a multi-sided marketplace with heterogeneous and hierarchical contents. We propose a constrained optimization framework with machine learning models for each objective as inputs, and a probabilistic structural model for users’ engagement patterns on heterogeneous contents. Our proposed structural modeling approach ensures consistent user experience across different levels of aggregation of the contents, and provides levels of transparency to the merchants and content providers. We further develop an efficient optimization solution for ranking and recommendation in large-scale online systems in real time. We implement the framework at Uber Eats, one of the largest online food delivery platforms in the world and a three-sided marketplace consisting of eaters, restaurant partners and delivery partners. Online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in ranking heterogeneous contents and optimizing for the three sides in the marketplace. Our framework has been deployed globally as the recommendation algorithm for Uber Eats’ homepage.</p>

    <p>Newsletters have (re-) emerged as a powerful tool for publishers to engage with their readers directly and more effectively. Despite the diversity in their audiences, publishers’ newsletters remain largely a one-size-fits-all offering, which is suboptimal. In this paper, we present NU:BRIEF, a web application for publishers that enables them to personalize their newsletters without harvesting personal data. Personalized newsletters build a habit and become a great conversion tool for publishers, providing an alternative readers-generated revenue model to a declining ad/clickbait-centered business model.<br>Demo: https://demo.nubrief.com/md03PaAJSwXMegL5BbKpQlArK3elb3hDUglcHodx4gE=/<br>Explainer video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUZGuyPJYH4</p>
