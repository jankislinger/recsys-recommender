    <h3>Time-Aware Item Weighting for the Next Basket Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksey Romanov, Sergey Kolesnikov, Oleg Lashinin, Marina Ananyeva</p>
    <p>In this paper we study the next basket recommendation problem. Recent methods use different approaches to achieve better performance. However, many of them do not use information about the time of prediction and time intervals between baskets. To fill this gap, we propose a novel method, Time-Aware Item-based Weighting (TAIW), which takes timestamps and intervals into account. We provide experiments on three real-world datasets, and TAIW outperforms well-tuned state-of-the-art baselines for next-basket recommendations. In addition, we show the results of an ablation study and a case study of a few items.</p>

    <h3>The Elephant in the Room: Rethinking the Usage of Pre-trained Language Model in Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zekai Qu, Chaojun Xiao, Zhanhui Kang, Ruobing Xie, Xingwu Sun</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation (SR) has seen significant advancements with the help of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Some PLM-based SR models directly use PLM to encode user historical behaviorâ€™s text sequences to learn user representations, while there is seldom an in-depth exploration of the capability and suitability of PLM in behavior sequence modeling. In this work, we first conduct extensive model analyses between PLMs and PLM-based SR models, discovering great underutilization and parameter redundancy of PLMs in behavior sequence modeling. Inspired by this, we explore different lightweight usages of PLMs in SR, aiming to maximally stimulate the ability of PLMs for SR while satisfying the efficiency and usability demands of practical systems. We discover that adopting behavior-tuned PLMs for item initializations of conventional ID-based SR models is the most economical framework of PLM-based SR, which would not bring in any additional inference cost but could achieve a dramatic performance boost compared with the original version. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that our simple and universal framework leads to significant improvement compared to classical SR and SOTA PLM-based SR models without additional inference costs.</p>

    <h3>Exploring False Hard Negative Sample in Cross-Domain Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haokai Ma, Xu Zhang, Lei Meng, Xin Chen, Jie Zhou, Leyu Lin, Ruobing Xie</p>
    <p>Negative Sampling in recommendation aims to capture informative negative instances for the sparse user-item interactions to improve the performance. Conventional negative sampling methods tend to select informative hard negative samples (HNS) besides the default random samples. However, these hard negative sampling methods usually struggle with false hard negative samples (FHNS), which happens when a user-item interaction has not been observed yet and is picked as a negative sample, while the user will actually interact with this item once exposed to it. Such FHNS issues may seriously confuse the model training, while most conventional hard negative sampling methods do not systematically explore and distinguish FHNS from HNS. To address this issue, we propose a novel model-agnostic Real Hard Negative Sampling (RealHNS) framework specially for cross-domain recommendation (CDR), which aims to discover the false and refine the real from all HNS via both general and cross-domain real hard negative sample selectors. For the general part, we conduct the coarse-grained and fine-grained real HNS selectors sequentially, armed with a dynamic item-based FHNS filter to find high-quality HNS. For the cross-domain part, we further design a new cross-domain HNS for alleviating negative transfer in CDR and discover its corresponding FHNS via a dynamic user-based FHNS filter to keep its power. We conduct experiments on four datasets based on three representative model-agnostic hard negative sampling methods, along with extensive model analyses, ablation studies, and universality analyses. The consistent improvements indicate the effectiveness, robustness, and universality of RealHNS, which is also easy-to-deploy in real-world systems as a plug-and-play strategy. The source code will be released in the future.</p>
