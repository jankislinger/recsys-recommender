    <h3>CR-SoRec: BERT driven Consistency Regularization for Social Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raksha Jalan, Naoyuki Onoe, Tushar Prakash, Brijraj Singh</p>
    <p>In the real world, when we seek our friends’ opinions on various items or events, we request verbal social recommendations. It has been observed that we often turn to our friends for recommendations on a daily basis. The emergence of online social platforms has enabled users to share their opinion with their social connections. Therefore, we should consider users’ social connections to enhance online recommendation performance. The social recommendation aims to fuse social links with user-item interactions to offer more relevant recommendations. Several efforts have been made to develop an effective social recommendation system. However, there are two significant limitations to current methods: First, they haven’t thoroughly explored the intricate relationships between the diverse influences of neighbours on users’ preferences. Second, existing models are vulnerable to overfitting due to the relatively low number of user-item interaction records in the interaction space. For the aforementioned problems,  this paper offers a novel framework called CR-SoRec, an effective recommendation model based on BERT and Consistency Regularization. This model incorporates Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer(BERT) to learn bidirectional context-aware user and item embeddings with neighbourhood sampling. The neighbourhood Sampling technique samples the most influential neighbours for all the users/ items. Further, to effectively use the available user-item interaction data and social ties, we leverage diverse perspectives via consistency regularisation to harness the underlying information. The main objective of our model is to predict the next item that a user would interact with based on its interaction behaviour and social connections. Experimental results show that our model defines a new state-of-the-art on various datasets and outperforms previous work by a significant margin. Extensive experiments are conducted to analyse the method. We release the source code of our model at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CR-SoRec-68F4</p>

    <h3>Looks Can Be Deceiving: Linking User-Item Interactions and User’s Propensity Towards Multi-Objective Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Boratto, Patrik Dokoupil, Ladislav Peska</p>
    <p>Multi-objective recommender systems (MORS) provide suggestions to users according to multiple (and possibly conflicting) goals. When a system optimizes its results at the individual-user level, it tailors them on a user’s propensity towards the different objectives. Hence, the capability to understand users’ fine-grained needs towards each goal is crucial. In this paper, we present the results of a user study in which we monitored the way users interacted with recommended items, as well as their self-proclaimed propensities towards relevance, novelty and diversity objectives. The study was divided into several sessions, where users evaluated recommendation lists originating from a relevance-only single-objective baseline as well as MORS. We show that despite MORS-based recommendations attracted less selections, its presence in the early sessions is crucial for users’ satisfaction in the later stages. Surprisingly, the self-proclaimed willingness of users to interact with novel and diverse items is not always reflected in the recommendations they accept. Post-study questionnaires provide insights on how to deal with this matter, suggesting that MORS-based results should be accompanied by elements that allow users to understand the recommendations, so as to facilitate their acceptance.</p>

    <h3>Ti-DC-GNN: Incorporating Time-Interval Dual Graphs for Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Ivanova, Nikita Severin, Ivan Kireev, Ilya Makarov, Andrey Savchenko, Dmitrii Kiselev</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are essential for personalized content delivery and have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, traditional recommender systems are limited in their ability to capture complex relationships between users and items. Recently, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a promising solution for improving recommender systems by incorporating temporal and sequential information in dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel method, “Ti-DC-GNN” (Time-Interval Dual Causal Graph Neural Networks), based on an intermediate representation of graph evolution as a sequence of time-interval graphs. The main parts of the method are the novel forms of interval graphs: graph of causality and graph of consequence that explicitly preserve inter-relationships between edges (user-items interactions). The local and global message passing are developed based on edge memory to identify both short-term and long-term dependencies. Experiments on several well-known datasets show that our method consistently outperforms modern temporal GNNs with node memory alone in dynamic edge prediction tasks.</p>

    <h3>Hierarchical Latent Relation Modeling for Collaborative Metric Learning (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillaume Salha-Galvan, Romain Hennequin, Viet-Anh Tran, Manuel Moussallam</p>
    <p>Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for recommendation based on implicit feedback collaborative filtering. However, standard CML methods learn fixed user and item representations, which fails to capture the complex interests of users. Existing extensions of CML also either ignore the heterogeneity of user-item relations, i.e. that a user can simultaneously like very different items, or the latent item-item relations, i.e. that a user’s preference for an item depends, not only on its intrinsic characteristics, but also on items they previously interacted with. In this paper, we present a hierarchical CML model that jointly captures latent user-item and item-item relations from implicit data. Our approach is inspired by translation mechanisms from knowledge graph embedding and leverages memory-based attention networks. We empirically show the relevance of this joint relational modeling, by outperforming existing CML models on recommendation tasks on several real-world datasets. Our experiments also emphasize the limits of current CML relational models on very sparse datasets.</p>

    <h3>Matrix Factorization for Collaborative Filtering Is Just Solving an Adjoint Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model After All (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Wilhelm</p>
    <p>Matrix factorization-based methods are among the most popular methods for collaborative filtering tasks with implicit feedback. The most effective of these methods do not apply sign constraints, such as non-negativity, to their factors. Despite their simplicity, the latent factors for users and items lack interpretability, which is becoming an increasingly important requirement. In this work, we provide a theoretical link between unconstrained and the interpretable non-negative matrix factorization in terms of the personalized ranking induced by these methods. We also introduce a novel, latent Dirichlet allocation-inspired model for recommenders and extend our theoretical link to also allow the interpretation of an unconstrained matrix factorization as an adjoint formulation of our new model. Our experiments indicate that this novel approach represents the unknown processes of implicit user-item interactions in the real world much better than unconstrained matrix factorization while being interpretable.</p>

    <h3>TransNets: Learning to Transform for Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rose Catherine, William Cohen</p>
    <p>Recently, deep learning methods have been shown to improve the performance of recommender systems over traditional methods, especially when review text is available.  For example, a recent model, DeepCoNN, uses neural nets to learn one latent representation for the text of all reviews written by a target user, and a second latent representation for the text of all reviews for a target item, and then combines these latent representations to obtain state-of-the-art performance on recommendation tasks.  We show that (unsurprisingly) much of the predictive value of review text comes from reviews of the target user for the target item. We then introduce a way in which this information can be used in recommendation, even when the target user’s review for the target item is not available.  Our model, called TransNets, extends the DeepCoNN model by introducing an additional latent layer representing the target user-target item pair.  We then regularize this layer, at training time, to be similar to another latent representation of the target user’s review of the target item.  We show that TransNets and extensions of it improve substantially over the previous state-of-the-art.</p>
