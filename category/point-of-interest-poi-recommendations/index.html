    <h3>CAPRI-FAIR: Integration of Multi-sided Fairness in Contextual POI Recommendation Framework (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yonchanok Khaokaew, Jeffrey Chan, Flora D. Salim, Francis Dela Cruz</p>
    <p>Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation, a form of context-aware recommendation, takes into account spatio-temporal constraints and contexts like distance, peak business hours, and previous user check-ins. Given the ability of these kinds of systems to influence not just the consumer’s travel experience, but also the POI’s business, it is important to consider fairness from multiple perspectives. Unfortunately, these systems tend to provide less accurate recommendations to inactive users, and less exposure to unpopular POIs. The goal of this paper is to develop a post-filter methodology that incorporates provider and consumer fairness factors into pre-existing recommendation models, to satisfy fairness metrics like item exposure, and performance metrics like precision and distance, making the system more sustainable to both consumers and providers. Experiments have shown that using a linear scoring model for provider fairness in re-scoring recommended items yields the best tradeoff between performance and long-tail exposure, in some cases without a significant decrease in precision. When attempting to address consumer fairness by recommending more popular POIs to inactive users, the result was an increase in precision for only some recommendation models and datasets. Finally, when considering the tradeoff between both parameters, the combinations that reached the Pareto front of consumer and provider fairness, unfortunately, achieved the lowest precision values. We find that the nature of this tradeoff depends heavily on the model and the dataset.</p>

    <h3>User-Centered Evaluation of Strategies for Recommending Sequences of Points of Interest to Groups (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wolfgang Wörndl, Daniel Herzog</p>
    <p>Most recommender systems (RSs) predict the preferences of individual users; however, in certain scenarios, recommendations need to be made for a group of users. Tourism is a popular domain for group recommendations because people often travel in groups and look for point of interest (POI) sequences for their visits during a trip. In this study, we present different strategies that can be used to recommend POI sequences for groups. In addition, we introduce novel approaches, including a strategy called Split Group, which allows groups to split into smaller groups during a trip. We compared all strategies in a user study with 40 real groups. Our results proved that there was a significant difference in the quality of recommendations generated by using the different strategies. Most groups were willing to split temporarily during a trip, even when they were traveling with persons close to them. In this case, Split Group generated the best recommendations for different evaluation criteria. We use these findings to propose improvements for group recommendation strategies in the tourism domain.</p>
