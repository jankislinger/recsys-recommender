    <h3>Extended conversion: Capturing successful interactions in voice shopping (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elad Haramaty, Arnon Lazerson, Zohar Karnin, Yoelle Maarek, Liane Lewin-Eytan</p>
    <p>Being able to measure the success of online shopping interactions is crucial in order to evaluate and optimize the performance of e-commerce systems. We consider the domain of voice shopping, supported by digital voice-based assistants, where measuring successful interactions poses a challenge. Unlike Web shopping, which offers a rich amount of behavioral signals such as clicks, in voice shopping a non-negligible amount of shopping interactions frequently end without any immediate explicit or implicit user behavioral signal. Moreover, users may start their journey using voice, but finish elsewhere, for example by using their mobile app or Web. We explore the challenge of measuring successful interactions in voice product search based on users’ feedback, and propose a medium-term reward metric named Extended ConVersion (ECVR). ECVR extends the notion of conversion (purchase action), which is a clear and natural indication of success for an e-commerce system. The strength of this new metric, is that it does not only capture immediate conversion, but also a conversion that is part of the same user shopping journey, but is performed at a later stage, possibly using a different medium. We provide multiple ways of evaluating the quality of a metric, and use these to explore different parameters leading to different variants of ECVR. After finalizing these parameters, we show that a ranking system optimized for the proposed ECVR leads to an improvement in long-term engagement and revenue, without compromising immediate gains.</p>

    <h3>Product Collection Recommendation in Online Retail (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilias Fountalis, Unaiza Ahsan, Nikolaos Vasiloglou, Nian Yan, Huiming Qu, Khalifeh Al Jadda, Pigi Kouki</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are an integral part of eCommerce services, helping to optimize revenue and user satisfaction. Bundle recommendation has recently gained attention by the research community since behavioral data supports that users often buy more than one product in a single transaction. In most cases, bundle recommendations are of the form “users who bought product A also bought products B, C, and D”. Although such recommendations can be useful, there is no guarantee that  products A, B, C, and D may actually be related to each other.  In this paper, we address the problem of collection recommendation, i.e., recommending a collection of products that share a common theme and can potentially be purchased together in a single transaction.  We extend on traditional approaches that use mostly transactional data by incorporating both domain knowledge from product suppliers in the form of hierarchies, as well as textual  attributes from the products.  Our approach starts by combining product hierarchies together with transactional data or domain knowledge to identify candidate sets of product collections. Then, it generates the product collection recommendations from these candidate sets by learning a deep similarity model that leverages textual attributes. Experimental evaluation on real data from the Home Depot online retailer shows that the proposed solution can recommend collections of products with  increased accuracy when compared to expert-crafted collections. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>
