    <h3>Utilizing Non-click Samples via Semi-supervised Learning for Conversion Rate Prediction (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhao Wang, Dongbo Huang, Shanyang Jiang, Lan Zhang, Cheng Ding, Lan Xu, Jiahui Huang</p>
    <p>Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is essential in recommendation systems, facilitating precise matching between recommended items and users’ preferences. However, the sample selection bias (SSB) and data sparsity (DS) issues pose challenges to accurate prediction. Existing works have proposed the click-through and conversion rate (CTCVR) prediction task which models samples from exposure to “click and conversion” in entire space and incorporates multi-task learning. This approach has shown efficacy in mitigating these challenges. Nevertheless, it intensifies the false negative sample (FNS) problem. To be more specific, the CTCVR task implicitly treats all the CVR labels of non-click samples as negative, overlooking the possibility that some samples might convert if clicked. This oversight can negatively impact CVR model performance, as empirical analysis has confirmed. To this end, we advocate for discarding the CTCVR task and proposing a Non-click samples Improved Semi-supErvised (NISE) method for conversion rate prediction, where the non-click samples are treated as unlabeled. Our approach aims to predict their probabilities of conversion if clicked, utilizing these predictions as pseudo-labels for further model training. This strategy can help alleviate the FNS problem, and direct modeling of the CVR task across the entire space also mitigates the SSB and DS challenges. Additionally, we conduct multi-task learning by introducing an auxiliary click-through rate prediction task, thereby enhancing embedding layer representations. Our approach is applicable to various multi-task architectures. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both public and production datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed method in mitigating the FNS challenge and improving the CVR estimation.</p>

    <h3>Privacy Preserving Conversion Modeling in Data Clean Room (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Behnam Rezaei, Xiangyi Chen, Ling Leng, Jiajing Xu, Jiankai Sun, Kungang Li</p>
    <p>In the realm of online advertising, accurately predicting the conversion rates (CVR) is crucial for enhancing advertising efficiency and user satisfaction. However, it faces the challenge that due to user privacy choices and advertiser requirements, the advertising platform cannot get the conversion data from some advertisers, making accurate CVR predictions difficult. Although current methods like split learning or vertical federated learning do not share label information directly, they still exchange sample-level gradients, which introduces a privacy risk as adversaries might infer label information through the shared gradients. To address these challenges, our proposed model training framework incorporates several innovative techniques. Firstly, we employ batch-level aggregated gradients instead of sample-level gradients to enhance privacy. Secondly, to minimize communication costs, we utilize adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and gradient compression in conversion models. These methods allow for efficient collaboration between different parties while reducing the amount of data transferred. Lastly, we incorporate label differential privacy to protect model privacy. Given that this privacy protection alters the data distribution and can result in significant calibration error, we propose a de-biasing technique to ensure accurate model predictions even with perturbed label information. Our experimental results on industrial datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing the communication overhead and complying with advertisers’ privacy requirements and user privacy choice. This framework establishes a new benchmark for privacy-preserving and high-performance CVR prediction in the digital advertising industry.</p>
