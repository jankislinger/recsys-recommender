    <h3>Combining context features in sequence-aware recommender systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel Levin, Sarai Mizrachi</p>
    <p>There are several important design choices that machine learning practitioners need to make when incorporating predictors into RNN-based contextual recommender systems. A great deal of currently reported findings about these decisions focus on the setting where predicted items take on values from the space of sequence items. This work provides an empirical evaluation of some straightforward approaches of dealing with such problems on a real-world large scale prediction problem from the travel domain, where predicted entities do not live in the space of sequence items.</p>

    <h3>RecGAN: Recurrent Generative Adversarial Networks for Recommendation Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Homin Park, Homanga Bharadhwaj, Brian Y. Lim</p>
    <p>Recent studies in recommendation systems emphasize the significance of modeling latent features behind temporal evolution of user preference and item state to make relevant suggestions. However, static and dynamic behaviors and trends of users and items, which highly influence the feasibility of recommendations, were not adequately addressed in previous works. In this work, we leverage the temporal and latent feature modelling capabilities of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), respectively, to propose a Recurrent Generative Adversarial Network (RecGAN). We use customized Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells to capture latent features of users and items observable from short-term and long-term temporal profiles. The modification also includes collaborative filtering mechanisms to improve the relevance of recommended items. To evaluated RecGAN using two datasets on food and movie recommendation. Results indicate that our model outperforms other baseline models irrespective of user behavior and density of training data.</p>

    <h3>When Recurrent Neural Networks meet the Neighborhood for Session-Based Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malte Ludewig, Dietmar Jannach</p>
    <p>Deep learning methods have led to substantial progress in various application fields of AI, and in recent years a number of proposals were made to improve recommender systems with artificial neural networks. For the problem of making session-based recommendations, i.e., for recommending the next item in an anonymous session, Hidasi et al. recently investigated the application of recurrent neural networks with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU4REC). Assessing the true value of such novel approaches based only on what is reported in the literature is however difficult when no standard evaluation protocols are applied and when the strength of the baselines used in the performance comparison is not clear. In this work we show based on a comprehensive empirical evaluation that a heuristics-based nearest neighbor (kNN) scheme for sessions outperforms GRU4REC in the large majority of the tested configurations and datasets. Neighborhood sampling and efficient in-memory data structures ensure the scalability of the kNN method. The best results in the end were often achieved when we combine the kNN approach with GRU4REC, which shows that RNNs can leverage sequential signals in the data that cannot be detected by the co-occurrence-based kNN method.</p>

    <h3>Parallel Recurrent Neural Network Architectures for Feature-rich Session-based Recommendations (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Domonkos Tikk, Balázs Hidasi, Massimo Quadrana, Alexandros Karatzoglou</p>
    <p>Real-life recommender systems often face the daunting task of providing recommendations based only on the clicks of a user session. Methods that rely on user profiles — such as matrix factorization — perform very poorly in this setting, thus item-to-item recommendations are used most of the time. However the items typically have rich feature representations such as pictures and text descriptions that can be used to model the sessions. Here we investigate how these features can be exploited in Recurrent Neural Network based session models using deep learning. We show that obvious approaches do not leverage these data sources. We thus introduce a number of parallel RNN (p-RNN) architectures to model sessions based on the clicks and the features (images and text) of the clicked items. We also propose alternative training strategies for p-RNNs that suit them better than standard training. We show that p-RNN architectures with proper training have significant performance improvements over feature-less session models while all session-based models outperform the item-to-item type baseline.</p>
