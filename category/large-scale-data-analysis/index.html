    <h3>Learning to Represent Human Motives for Goal-directed Web Browsing (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longqi Yang, Jyun-Yu Jiang, Bahareh Sarrafzadeh, Brent Hecht, Jaime Teevan, Chia-Jung Lee</p>
    <p>Motives or goals are recognized in psychology literature as the most fundamental drive that explains and predicts why people do what they do, including when they browse the web. Although providing enormous value, these higher-ordered goals are often unobserved, and little is known about how to leverage such goals to assist peopleâ€™s browsing activities. This paper proposes to take a new approach to address this problem, which is fulfilled through a novel neural framework, Goal-directed Web Browsing  (GoWeB). We adopt a psychologically-sound taxonomy of higher-ordered goals and learn to build their representations in a structure-preserving manner. Then we incorporate the resulting representations for enhancing the experiences of common activities people perform on the web. Experiments on large-scale data from Microsoft Edge web browser show that GoWeB significantly outperforms competitive baselines for in-session web page recommendation, re-visitation classification, and goal-based web page grouping. A follow-up analysis further characterizes how the variety of human motives can affect the difference observed in human behavioral patterns.</p>

    <h3>Towards Multi-Language Recipe Personalisation and Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niall Twomey, Andrey Ponikar, Nadine Sarraf, Mikhail Fain</p>
    <p>Multi-language recipe personalisation and recommendation is an under-explored field of information retrieval in academic and production systems. The existing gaps in our current understanding are numerous, even on fundamental questions such as whether consistent and high-quality recipe recommendation can be delivered across languages. Motivated by this need, we consider the multi-language recipe recommendation setting and present grounding results that will help to establish the potential and absolute value of future work in this area. Our work draws on several billion events from millions of recipes, with published recipes and users incorporating several languages, including Arabic, English, Indonesian, Russian, and Spanish. We represent recipes using a combination of normalised ingredients, standardised skills and image embeddings obtained without human intervention. In modelling, we take a classical approach based on optimising an embedded bi-linear user-item metric space towards the interactions that most strongly elicit cooking intent. For users without interaction histories, a bespoke content-based cold-start model that predicts context and recipe affinity is introduced. We show that our approach to personalisation is stable and scales well to new languages. A robust cross-validation campaign is employed and consistently rejects baseline models and representations, strongly favouring those we propose. Our results are presented in a language-oriented (as opposed to model-oriented) fashion to emphasise the language-based goals of this work. We believe that this is the first large-scale work that evaluates the value and potential of multi-language recipe recommendation and personalisation.</p>

    <h3>A Novel Recommender System for Helping Marathoners to Achieve a New Personal-Best (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barry Smyth, Padraig Cunningham</p>
    <p>We describe a novel application of recommender systems, helping marathon runners to run a new personal-best race-time, by predicting a challenging, but achievable, target-time and by recommending a race-plan to achieve this time that is tailored to their ability and the course. A comprehensive evaluation of prediction accuracy and race-plan quality is provided using a large-scale dataset with almost 400,000 runners from the last 12 years of the Chicago marathon.</p>
