    <h3>Alleviating the Long-Tail Problem in Conversational Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Cao, Kun Zhou, Fan Pan, Zhipeng Zhao, Xiaolei Wang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) aim to provide the recommendation service via natural language conversations. To develop an effective CRS, high-quality CRS datasets are very crucial. However, existing CRS datasets suffer from the long-tail issue, \ie a large proportion of items are rarely (or even never) mentioned in the conversations, which are called long-tail items. As a result, the CRSs trained on these datasets tend to recommend frequent items,  and the diversity of the recommended items would be largely reduced, making users easier to get bored. To address this issue, this paper presents <b>LOT-CRS</b>, a novel framework that focuses on simulating and utilizing a balanced CRS dataset (\ie covering all the items evenly) for improving <b>LO</b>ng-<b>T</b>ail recommendation performance of CRSs. In our approach, we design two pre-training tasks to enhance the understanding of simulated conversation for long-tail items, and adopt retrieval-augmented fine-tuning with label smoothness strategy to further improve the recommendation of long-tail items. Extensive experiments on two public CRS datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and extensibility of our approach, especially on long-tail recommendation. All the experimental codes will be released after the review period.</p>

    <h3>Controlling Popularity Bias in Learning-to-Rank Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bamshad Mobasher, Himan Abdollahpouri, Robin Burke</p>
    <p>Many recommendation algorithms suffer from popularity bias in their output: popular items are recommended frequently and less popular ones rarely, if at all. However, less popular, long-tail items are precisely those that are desirable for increased user satisfaction. In this paper, we introduce a flexible regularization-based framework to enhance the longtail coverage of recommendation lists in a learning-to-rank algorithm. We show that regularization provides a tunable mechanism for controlling the trade-off between accuracy and coverage. Moreover, the experimental results using two data sets show that it is possible to achieve higher coverage of long tail items without substantial sacrifice of ranking performance.</p>

    <h3>Predicting Online Performance of News Recommender Systems Through Richer Evaluation Metrics (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boi Faltings, Florent Garcin, Andrii Maksai</p>
    <p>We investigate how metrics that can be measured offine can be used to predict the online performance of recommender systems, thus avoiding costly A-B testing. In addition to accuracy metrics, we combine diversity, coverage, and serendipity metrics to create a new performance model. Using the model, we quantify the trade-off between different metrics and propose to use it to tune the parameters of recommender algorithms without the need for online testing. Another application for the model is a self-adjusting algorithm blend that optimizes a recommenderâ€™s parameters over time. We evaluate our findings on data and experiments from news websites.</p>

    <h3>Coverage, Redundancy and Size-Awareness in Genre Diversity for Recommender Systems (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saul Vargas, Pablo Castells, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Linas Baltrunas</p>
    <p>There is increasing awareness in the Recommender Systems field that diversity is as a key property that enhances the usefulness of recommendations. Genre information can serve as a means to measure and enhance the diversity of recommendations and is readily available in domains such as movies, music or books. In this work we propose a new Binomial framework for defining genre diversity in recommender systems that takes into account three key properties: genre coverage, genre redundancy and recommendation list size-awareness. We show that methods previously proposed for measuring and enhancing recommendation diversity -including those adapted from search result diversification- fail to address adequately these three properties. We also propose an efficient greedy optimization technique to optimize Binomial diversity. Experiments with the Netflix dataset show the properties of our framework and comparison with state of the art methods.</p>
