    <h3>STRec: Sparse Transformer for Sequential Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lixin Zou, Yiqi Wang, Qidong Liu, Wanyu Wang, Wenqi Fan, Yejing Wang, Chengxi Li, Qing Li, Xiangyu Zhao</p>
    <p>With the rapid evolution of transformer architectures, an increasing number of researchers are exploring their application in sequential recommender systems (SRSs). Compared with the former SRS models, the transformer-based models get promising performance on SRS tasks. Existing transformer-based SRS frameworks, however, retain the vanilla attention mechanism, which calculates the attention scores between all item-item pairs in each layer, i.e., item interactions. Consequently, redundant item interactions may downgrade the inference speed and cause high memory costs for the model. In this paper, we first identify the sparse information phenomenon in transformer-based SRS scenarios and propose an efficient model, i.e., Sparse Transformer sequential Recommendation model (STRec). First, we devise a cross-attention-based sparse transformer for efficient sequential recommendation. Then, a novel sampling strategy is derived to  preserve the necessary interactions. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our framework, which could outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing 54% inference time and 70% memory cost. Besides, we provide massive extended experiments to further investigate the property of our framework. Our code is available to ease reproducibility.</p>

    <h3>ProtoCF: Prototypical Collaborative Filtering for Few-shot Item Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aravind Sankar, Hari Sundaram, Junting Wang, Adit Krishnan</p>
    <p>In recent times, deep learning methods have supplanted conventional collaborative filtering approaches as the backbone of modern recommender systems. However, their gains are skewed towards popular items with a drastic performance drop for the vast collection of long-tail items with sparse interactions. Moreover, we empirically show that prior neural recommenders lack the resolution power to accurately rank relevant items within the long-tail. In this paper, we formulate long-tail item recommendations as a few-shot learning problem of learning-to-recommend few-shot items with very few interactions. We propose a novel meta-learning framework ProtoCF that learns-to-compose robust prototype representations for few-shot items. ProtoCF utilizes episodic few-shot learning to extract meta-knowledge across a collection of diverse meta-training tasks designed to mimic item ranking within the tail. To further enhance discriminative power, we propose a novel architecture-agnostic technique based on knowledge distillation to extract, relate, and transfer knowledge from neural base recommenders. Our experimental results demonstrate that ProtoCF consistently outperforms state-of-art approaches on overall recommendation (by 5% Recall@50) while achieving significant gains (of 60-80% Recall@50) for tail items with less than 20 interactions.</p>

    <h3>Combining Text Summarization and Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis of Users’ Reviews to Justify Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Lops, Giovanni Semeraro, Marco de Gemmis, Cataldo Musto, Gaetano Rossiello</p>
    <p>In this paper we present a methodology to justify recommendations that relies on the information extracted from users’ reviews discussing the available items. The intuition behind the approach is to conceive the justification as a summary of the most relevant and distinguishing aspects ofthe item, automatically obtained by analyzing the available reviews. To this end, we designed a pipeline of natural language processing techniques based on aspect extraction, sentiment analysis and text summarization to gather the reviews, process the relevant excerpts,and generate a unique synthesis presenting the main characteristics of the item. Such a summary is finally presented to the target user as justification of the recommendation she received. In the experimental evaluation we carried out a user study in the movie domain (N=141) and the results showed that our approach is able to make the recommendation process more transparent, engaging and trustful for the users. Moreover, the proposed method also beat another review-based explanation technique, thus confirming the validity of our intuition. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Cross-Domain Recommendations Without Overlapping Data: Myth or Reality? (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Cremonesi, Massimo Quadrana</p>
    <p>Cross-domain recommender systems adopt different tech- niques to transfer learning from source domain to target domain in order to alleviate the sparsity problem and improve accuracy of recommendations. Traditional techniques require the two domains to be linked by shared characteristics associated to either users or items. In collaborative-filtering (CF) this happens when the two domains have overlapping users or item (at least partially). Recently, Li et al. [7] introduced codebook transfer (CBT), a cross-domain CF technique based on co-clustering, and presented experimental results showing that CBT is able to transfer knowledge between non-overlapping domains. In this paper, we disprove these results and show that CBT does not transfer useful knowledge when source and target domains do not overlap.</p>
