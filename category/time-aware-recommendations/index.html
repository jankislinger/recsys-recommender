    <h3>Timely Personalization at Peloton: A System and Algorithm for Boosting Time-Relevant Content (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnab Bhadury, Shayak Banerjee, Vijay Pappu, Nilothpal Talukder, Jasmine Paulino, Shoya Yoshida, Allison Schloss</p>
    <p>At Peloton, we are challenged to not just surface relevant recommendations of fitness classes to our members, but also timely ones. As our fitness content library expands, we continually produce classes on certain themes which are most timely during a narrow time window. To address this challenge, we provide some control over our recommendations to external stakeholders, such as production and marketing teams. They enter timed boosts of certain classes during the windows they are relevant in. We have built out algorithms which take these desired classes and elevate the number of impressions for them, while preserving members’ engagement with our recommendations. In this paper, we discuss the system, the algorithms and some results from a few A/B tests showing how boosting works in practice.</p>

    <h3>Collective Embedding for Neural Context-Aware Recommender Systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Dolog, Felipe Soares da Costa</p>
    <p>Context-aware recommender systems consider contextual features as additional information to predict user’s preferences. For example, the recommendations could be based on time, location, or the company of other people. Among the contextual information, time became an important feature because user preferences tend to change over time or be similar in the near future. Researchers have proposed different models to incorporate time into their recommender system, however, the current models are not able to capture specific temporal patterns. To address the limitation observed in previous works, we propose Collective embedding for Neural Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CoNCARS). The proposed solution jointly model the item, user and time embeddings to capture temporal patterns. Then, CoNCARS use the outer product to model the user-item-time correlations between dimensions of the embedding space. The hidden features feed our Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn the non-linearities between the different features. Finally, we combine the output from our CNNs in the fusion layer and then predict the user’s preference score. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating CoNCARS improves the top-N item recommendation task and outperform the state-of-the-art recommendation methods.</p>

    <h3>CheckInShop.eu: A Sensor-based Recommender System for micro-location Marketing (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stergios Chairistanidis, Panagiotis Symeonidis</p>
    <p>CheckInShop is an app that employs sensors to capture the user preferences  in physical stores and provide either micro-location marketing or product recommendations. By utilizing iBeacon technology and with the exploitation of a mobile app, we keep track of customer’s preferences in physical stores. Then, based on the time that a product is viewed by a customer and his micro-location inside the store, we send to him either product offers or recommendations of similar products to the ones he is looking at. These recommendations are accurate because they are provided at the right time and in the right place.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Temporal Influence in Online Recommendation (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Palovics, Tamas Kiss, Andras Benczur, Erzsebet Frigo, Levente Kocsis</p>
    <p>In this paper we give methods for time aware music recommendation in a social media service with the potential of exploiting immediate temporal influences between users. We consider events when a user listens to an artist the first time and this event follows some friend listening to the same artist short time before. We train a blend of matrix factorization methods that model the relation of the influencer, the influenced and the artist, both the individual factor decompositions and their weight learned by variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Special care is taken since events of influence form a subset of the positive implicit feedback data and hence we have to cope with two different definitions of the positive and negative implicit training data. In addition, in the time aware setting we have to use online learning and evaluation methods. While SGD can easily be trained online, evaluation is cumbersome by traditional measures since we will have potentially different top recommendations at different times. Our experiments are carried over the two-year scrobble history of 70,000 Last.fm users and show a 4% increase in recommendation quality by predicting temporal influences.</p>
