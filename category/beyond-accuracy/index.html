    <h3>Repeated Padding for Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianzhe Zhao, Linying Jiang, Yuting Liu, Yizhou Dang, Xingwei Wang, Guibing Guo, Enneng Yang</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation aims to provide users with personalized suggestions based on their historical interactions. When training sequential models, padding is a widely adopted technique for two main reasons: 1) The vast majority of models can only handle fixed-length sequences; 2) Batch-based training needs to ensure that the sequences in each batch have the same length. The special value 0 is usually used as the padding content, which does not contain the actual information and is ignored in the model calculations. This common-sense padding strategy leads us to a problem that has never been explored in the recommendation field: Can we utilize this idle input space by padding other content to improve model performance and training efficiency further? In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective padding method called Repeated Padding (RepPad). Specifically, we use the original interaction sequences as the padding content and fill it to the padding positions during model training. This operation can be performed a finite number of times or repeated until the input sequences’ length reaches the maximum limit. Our RepPad can be considered as a sequence-level data augmentation strategy. Unlike most existing works, our method contains no trainable parameters or hyperparameters and is a plug-and-play data augmentation operation. Extensive experiments on various categories of sequential models and five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. The average recommendation performance improvement is up to 60.3% on GRU4Rec and 24.3% on SASRec. We also provide in-depth analysis and explanation of what makes RepPad effective from multiple perspectives. The source code will be released to ensure the complete reproducibility of our experiments.</p>

    <h3>The Fault in Our Recommendations: On the Perils of Optimizing the Measurable (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshit Kumar, Yash Kanoria, Omar Besbes</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems play a pivotal role on digital platforms by curating content, products and services for users. These systems are widespread, and through customized recommendations, promise to match users with options they will like. To that end,  data on engagement is collected and used, with, e.g., measurements of clicks, but also  purchases or consumption times.   Most recommendation systems are ranking-based, where they rank and recommend items based on their predicted engagement.  However, the engagement signals  are often only a crude proxy for user utility, as data on the latter is rarely collected or available. This paper explores the following critical research question: By optimizing for measurable proxies, are recommendation systems at risk of significantly under-delivering on user utility? If that is indeed the case, how can one improve utility which is seldom measured? To study these questions, we introduce a model of repeated user consumption in which, at each interaction, users select between an outside option and the best option from a recommendation set. Our model accounts for user heterogeneity, with the majority preferring “popular” content, and a minority favoring “niche” content. The system initially lacks knowledge of individual user preferences but can learn these preferences through observations of users’ choices over time. Our theoretical and numerical analysis demonstrate that optimizing for engagement signals can lead to significant utility losses. Instead, we propose a utility-aware policy that initially recommends a mix of popular and niche content. We show that such a policy substantially improves  utility despite not measuring it. In fact, in the limit of a forward-looking platform with discount factor $\delta \to 1$, our utility-aware policy achieves the best of both worlds: near-optimal user utility and near-optimal engagement simultaneously. Our study elucidates  an important feature of recommendation systems; given the ability to suggest multiple items, one can perform significant exploration without incurring significant reductions in short term engagement. By recommending high-risk, high-reward items alongside popular items, systems can enhance discovery of high utility items without significantly affecting engagement.</p>

    <h3>MARec: Metadata Alignment for cold-start Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anirban Majumder, Wentao Lu, Julien Monteil, Volodymyr Vaskovych, Anton van den Hengel</p>
    <p>For many recommender systems the primary data source is a historical record of user clicks. The associated click matrix which is often very sparse, however, as the number of users x products can be far larger than the number of clicks, and such sparsity is accentuated in cold-start settings. The sparsity of the click matrix is the reason matrix factorization and autoencoders techniques remain highly competitive across collaborative filtering datasets. In this work, we propose a simple approach to address cold-start recommendations by leveraging content metadata, Metadata Alignment for cold-start Recommendation (MARec). we show that this approach can readily augment existing matrix factorization and autoencoder approaches, enabling a smooth transition to top performing algorithms in warmer set-ups. Our experimental results indicate three separate contributions: first, we show that our proposed framework largely beats SOTA results on 4 cold-start datasets with different sparsity and scale characteristics, with gains ranging from +8.4% to +53.8% on reported ranking metrics; second, we provide an ablation study on the utility of semantic features, and proves the additional gain obtained by leveraging such features ranges between +46.8% and +105.5%; and third, our approach is by construction highly competitive in warm set-ups, and we propose a closed-form solution outperformed by SOTA results by only 0.8% on average.</p>

    <h3>AMBAR: A dataset for Assessing Multiple Beyond-Accuracy Recommenders (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Contreras, Ludovico Boratto, Elizabeth Gómez, Maria Salamo</p>
    <p>Nowadays a recommendation model should exploit additional information from both the user and item perspectives, in addition to utilizing user-item interaction data. Datasets are central in offering the required information for evaluating new models or algorithms. Although there are many datasets in the literature with user and item properties, there are several issues not covered yet: (i) it is difficult to perform cross-analysis of properties at user and item level as they are not related in most cases; and (ii) on top of that, in many occasions datasets do not allow analysis at different granularity levels. In this paper, we propose a new dataset in the music domain, named AMBAR, that includes the above-mentioned issues. Besides detailing in depth the structure of the new dataset, we also show its application in contexts (i.e., multi-objective, fair, and calibrated recommendations) where both the effectiveness and the beyond-accuracy perspectives of recommendation are assessed.</p>

    <h3>beeFormer: Bridging the Gap Between Semantic and Interaction Similarity in Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vojtěch Vančura, Milan Straka, Pavel Kordík</p>
    <p>Recommender systems often use text-side information to improve their predictions, especially in cold-start or zero-shot recommendation scenarios, where traditional collaborative filtering approaches cannot be used. Many approaches to text-mining side information for recommender systems have been proposed over recent years, with sentence Transformers being the most prominent one. However, these models are trained to predict semantic similarity without utilizing interaction data with hidden patterns specific to recommender systems. In this paper, we propose beeFormer, a framework for training sentence Transformer models with interaction data. We demonstrate that our models trained with beeFormer can transfer knowledge between datasets while outperforming not only semantic similarity sentence Transformers but also traditional collaborative filtering methods. We also show that training on multiple datasets from different domains accumulates knowledge in a single model, unlocking the possibility of training universal, domain-agnostic sentence Transformer models to mine text representations for recommender systems. We release the source code, trained models, and additional details allowing replication of our experiments at https://github.com/recombee/beeformer.</p>

    <h3>Short-form Video Needs Long-term Interests: An Industrial Solution for Serving Large User Sequence Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Most, Yuening Li, Qingyun Liu, Liang Liu, Xinyang Yi, Junjie Shan, Shuchao Bi, Lichan Hong, Chuan He, Jiaxi Tang, Diego Uribe, Kaushik Kalyan, Ed Chi</p>
    <p>Sequential models are invaluable for powering personalized recommendation systems. In the context of short-form video (SFV) feeds, where user behavior history is typically longer, there’s a need for a system to handle users’ long-term interests. However, deploying large sequence models to extensive web-scale applications faces challenges due to high serving cost. To address this, we propose an industrial framework designed for efficiently serving large user sequence models. Specifically, the proposed infrastructure decouples the serving of user sequence model and the main recommendation model, with user sequence model served offline (in an asynchronous manner) with periodical refresh. The proposed infrastructure is also model-agnostic; thus, it can be used to support any types of user sequence models (even LLMs) with controllable costs. Empirical results show that large user models deployed with our framework significantly and consistently enhances the quality of the main recommendation model, with minimal serving costs increase.</p>

    <h3>Scene-wise Adaptive Network for Dynamic Cold-start Scenes Optimization in CTR Prediction (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Tang, Wenhao Li, Jie Zhou, Shixiong Zhao, Chuan Luo, Kun Zhang</p>
    <p>In the realm of modern mobile E-commerce, providing users with nearby commercial service recommendations through location-based online services has become increasingly vital. While machine learning approaches have shown promise in multi-scene recommendation, existing methodologies often struggle to address cold-start problems in unprecedented scenes: the increasing diversity of commercial choices, along with the short online lifespan of scenes, give rise to the complexity of effective recommendations in online and dynamic scenes. In this work, we propose Scene-wise Adaptive Network (SwAN), a novel approach that emphasizes high-performance cold-start online recommendations for new scenes. Our approach introduces several crucial capabilities, including scene similarity learning, user-specific scene transition cognition, scene-specific information construction for the new scene, and enhancing the diverged logical information between scenes. We demonstrate SwAN’s potential to optimize dynamic multi-scene recommendation problems by effectively online handling cold-start recommendations for any newly arrived scenes. More encouragingly, SwAN has been successfully deployed in Company M’s online catering recommendation service, which serves millions of customers per day, and SwAN has achieved a 5.64% CTR index improvement relative to the baselines and a 5.19% increase in daily order volume proportion.</p>

    <h3>A New Perspective in Health Recommendations: Integration of Human Pose Estimation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaetano Dibenedetto</p>
    <p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in multimodal and multi-source data due to their ability to introduce heterogeneous information. Studies have demonstrated that combining such information enhances the performance of Recommender Systems across various scenarios. In the context of Health Recommendation Systems (HRS), different types of data are utilized, primarily focusing on patient-based information, but data from Pose Estimations (PE) are not incorporated. The objective of my Ph.D. is to investigate methods to design and develop HRS that treat the PE as one of the input sources, taking into account aspects such as privacy concerns and balancing the trade-off between system quality and responsiveness. By leveraging the combination of diverse information sources, I intend to create a new model in the area of HRS capable of providing more precise and explainable recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Neighborhood-Based Collaborative Filtering for Conversational Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Mcauley, Zhouhang Xie, Nathan Kallus, Dawen Liang, Rahul Jha, Hyunsik Jeon, Zhankui He, Harald Steck, Junda Wu</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) should understand users’ expressed interests that are frequently semantically rich and knowledge intensive. Prior works attempt to address this challenge by making use of external knowledge bases or parametric knowledge in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we study a complementary solution, exploiting item knowledge in the training data. We hypothesise that many inference-time user requests can be answered via reusing popular crowd-written answers associated with similar training queries. Following this intuition, we define a class of neighborhood-based CRS that make recommendations by identifying popular items associated with similar training dialogue contexts. Experiments on Inspired, Redial, and Reddit benchmarks show that despite its simplicity, our method achieves comparable to better performance than state-of-the-art LLM-based methods with over 200 times more parameters. We also show neighborhood and model-based predictions can be combined to achieve further performance improvements over both components.</p>

    <h3>CAPRI-FAIR: Integration of Multi-sided Fairness in Contextual POI Recommendation Framework (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yonchanok Khaokaew, Jeffrey Chan, Flora D. Salim, Francis Dela Cruz</p>
    <p>Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation, a form of context-aware recommendation, takes into account spatio-temporal constraints and contexts like distance, peak business hours, and previous user check-ins. Given the ability of these kinds of systems to influence not just the consumer’s travel experience, but also the POI’s business, it is important to consider fairness from multiple perspectives. Unfortunately, these systems tend to provide less accurate recommendations to inactive users, and less exposure to unpopular POIs. The goal of this paper is to develop a post-filter methodology that incorporates provider and consumer fairness factors into pre-existing recommendation models, to satisfy fairness metrics like item exposure, and performance metrics like precision and distance, making the system more sustainable to both consumers and providers. Experiments have shown that using a linear scoring model for provider fairness in re-scoring recommended items yields the best tradeoff between performance and long-tail exposure, in some cases without a significant decrease in precision. When attempting to address consumer fairness by recommending more popular POIs to inactive users, the result was an increase in precision for only some recommendation models and datasets. Finally, when considering the tradeoff between both parameters, the combinations that reached the Pareto front of consumer and provider fairness, unfortunately, achieved the lowest precision values. We find that the nature of this tradeoff depends heavily on the model and the dataset.</p>

    <h3>MMGCL: Meta Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-view Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wentao Zhang, Peng Jiang, Gaode Chen, Qi Zhang, Jingjian Lin, Changyu Li, Yuezihan Jiang, Peiyi Li, Fei Sun</p>
    <p>Multi-view Graph Learning is popular in recommendations due to its ability to capture relationships and connections across multiple views. Existing multi-view graph learning methods generally involve constructing graphs of views and performing information aggregation on view representations. Despite their effectiveness, they face two data limitations: Multi-focal Multi-source data noise and multi-source Data Sparsity. The former arises from the combination of noise from individual views and conflicting edges between views when information from all views is combined. The latter occurs because multi-view learning exacerbate the negative influence of data sparsity because these methods require more model parameters to learn more view information. Motivated by these issues, we propose MMGCL, a meta knowledge-enhanced multi-view graph contrastive learning framework for recommendations. To tackle the data noise issue, MMGCL extract meta knowledge to preserve important information from all views to form a meta view representation. It then rectifies every view in multi-learning frameworks, thus simultaneously removing the view-private noisy edges and conflicting edges across different views. To address the data sparsity issue, MMGCL performs meta knowledge transfer contrastive learning optimization on all views to reduce the searching space for model parameters and add more supervised signal. Besides, we have deployed MMGCL in a real industrial recommender system in China, and we further evaluate it on four benchmark datasets and a practical industry online application. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art recommendation performance of MMGCL.</p>

    <h3>Encouraging Exploration in Spotify Search through Query Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henrik Lindstrom, Humberto Jesús Corona Pampín, Alva Liu, Enrico Palumbo</p>
    <p>At Spotify, search has been traditionally seen as a tool for retrieving content, with the search system optimized for when the user has a specific search target in mind. In particular we have relied on an instant search system providing results for each keystroke, which works well for known-item search, when queries are straightforward, and the catalog is small. However, as Spotify’s catalog grows in size and variety, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to define their search intents accurately. Furthermore, as we expand the offering, we need to help users discover more content both when it comes to new content types, e.g. audiobooks, as well as for new content/creators within existing content types. To solve this we have introduced a hybrid Query Recommendation system (QR) that helps the user formulate more complex exploratory search intents, while still serving known-item lookups efficiently. This experience has been rolled out worldwide to all mobile users resulting in an increase in exploratory intent queries of ~9% in online A/B tests.</p>

    <h3>Multimodal Representation Learning for high-quality Recommendations in Cold-start and Beyond-Accuracy (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marta Moscati</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RS) traditionally leverage the large amount of user–item interaction data. This exposes RS to a lower recommendation quality in cold-start scenarios, as well as to a low recommendation quality in terms of beyond-accuracy evaluation metrics. State-of-the-art (SotA) models for cold-start scenarios rely on the use of side information on the items or the users, therefore relating recommendation to multimodal machine learning (ML). However, the most recent techniques from multimodal ML are often not applied to the domain of recommendation. Additionally, the evaluation of SotA multimodal RS often neglects beyond-accuracy aspects of recommendation. In this work, we outline research into designing novel multimodal RS based on SotA multimodal ML architectures for cold-start recommendation, and their evaluation and benchmark with preexisting multimodal RS in terms of accuracy and beyond-accuracy aspects of recommendation quality.</p>

    <h3>Towards Open-World Recommendation with Knowledge Augmentation from Large Language Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiwen Liu, Bo Chen, Yong Yu, Hong Zhu, Yunjia Xi, Weinan Zhang, Jianghao Lin, Xiaoling Cai, Jieming Zhu, Ruiming Tang</p>
    <p>Recommender system plays a vital role in various online services. However, its insulated nature of training and deploying separately within a specific closed domain limits its access to open-world knowledge. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in bridging this gap by encoding extensive world knowledge and demonstrating reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, previous attempts to directly use LLMs as recommenders cannot meet the inference latency demand of industrial recommender systems. In this work, we propose an Open-World Knowledge Augmented Recommendation Framework with Large Language Models, dubbed KAR, to acquire two types of external knowledge from LLMs — the reasoning knowledge on user preferences and the factual knowledge on items. We introduce factorization prompting to elicit accurate reasoning on user preferences. The generated reasoning and factual knowledge are effectively transformed and condensed into augmented vectors by a hybrid-expert adaptor in order to be compatible with the recommendation task. The obtained vectors can then be directly used to enhance the performance of any recommendation model. We also ensure efficient inference by preprocessing and prestoring the knowledge from the LLM. Extensive experiments show that KAR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and is compatible with a wide range of recommendation algorithms. We deploy KAR to Huawei’s news and music recommendation platforms and gain a 7% and 1.7% improvement in the online A/B test, respectively.</p>

    <h3>Optimizing for Participation in Recommender System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourabh Bansod, Yaping Zhang, Bibang Liu, Mingyan Gao, Yuan Shao, Arnab Bhadury</p>
    <p>The traditional recommender system has been designed to mostly optimize for viewer consumption, and with the rise of short form videos, the boundaries between consumption and participation have blurred. This shift presents an opportunity to optimize recommender systems not only for passive consumption, but also for active participation in content creation. In this paper, we document the development of a recommender system that provides inspiration to existing content uploaders and new future content uploaders to encourage participation. Our contributions are two-fold: 1) Inspiration Framework: We present a novel framework for building a recommender system that goes beyond traditional consumption-focused metrics, specifically addressing the need for creative inspiration to lower barriers for participation. This framework is adaptable in the design of large-scale recommender systems in other domains. 2) Empirical Evaluation: We conduct systematic evaluation via live experiments to prove the values of the proposed system in increasing daily participation and participants.</p>

    <h3>Recommending Healthy and Sustainable Meals exploiting Food Retrieval and Large Language Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Ciro Di Carlo, Giovanni Semeraro, Giovanni Tempesta, Cataldo Musto, Alessandro Petruzzelli</p>
    <p>Many people are constantly seeking to make healthy food choices, but increasingly, we are also considering the impact our dietary habits have on the environment. This creates a complex challenge: how can we ensure that we are eating nutritious foods that nourish our bodies while also minimizing the environmental footprint of our meals?To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework called Healthy And Sustainable eating (HeASe). Given the rising global concerns about nutrition and environmental sustainability, individuals need effective tools to help them navigate these issues. HeASe leverages the latest advancements in artificial intelligence to empower users with knowledge and self-awareness.The framework works in two steps. First, it uses a food retrieval strategy that takes into account macro-nutrient information to identify alternative meals for a chosen recipe. This ensures that the substitutions maintain a similar nutritional profile. Next, HeASe employs large language models to re-rank these potential replacements while considering factors beyond just nutrition, such as the recipe’s environmental impact and other user-defined preferences. The experimental phase of this research demonstrates the capabilities of LLM in identifying the more sustainable and healthy recipe within a set of candidate options. This highlights the potential of these models to guide users towards food choices that are both nutritious and environmentally responsible.</p>
