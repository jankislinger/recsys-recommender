    <h3>Asymmetric Bayesian Personalized Ranking for One-Class Collaborative Filtering (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhong Ming, Lin Li, Weike Pan, Shan Ouyang</p>
    <p>In this paper, we propose a novel preference assumption for modeling users’ one-class feedback such as ‘thumb up’ in an important recommendation problem called one-class collaborative filtering (OCCF). Specifically, we address a fundamental limitation of a recent symmetric pairwise preference assumption and propose a novel and first asymmetric one, which is able to make the preferences of different users more comparable. With the proposed asymmetric pairwise preference assumption, we further design a novel recommendation algorithm called asymmetric Bayesian personalized ranking (ABPR). Extensive empirical studies on two large and public datasets show that our ABPR performs significantly better than several state-of-the-art recommendation methods with either pointwise preference assumption or pairwise preference assumption. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Unifying Nearest Neighbors Collaborative Filtering (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koen Verstrepen, Bart Goethals</p>
    <p>We study collaborative filtering for applications in which there exists for every user a set of items about which the user has given binary, positive-only feedback (one-class collaborative filtering). Take for example an on-line store that knows all past purchases of every customer. An important class of algorithms for one-class collaborative filtering are the nearest neighbors algorithms, typically divided into user-based and item-based algorithms. We introduce a reformulation that unifies user- and item-based nearest neighbors algorithms and use this reformulation to propose a novel algorithm that incorporates the best of both worlds and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, we propose a method for naturally explaining the recommendations made by our algorithm and show that this method is also applicable to existing user-based nearest neighbors methods.</p>
