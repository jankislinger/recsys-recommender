    <h3>It’s (not) all about that CTR: A Multi-Stakeholder Perspective on News Recommender Metrics (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanne Vandenbroucke, Annelien Smets</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems are increasingly adopted by news media organizations. Existing literature examines various aspects of news recommendation systems (NRS) from a computational, user-centric, or normative perspective. Yet, scholars have argued to study the complexity of real-world applications surrounding the development and evaluation of NRS. More specifically, understand why different stakeholders within the organization prioritize different values for developing NRS and how those values are operationalized into metrics. Recently, a multi-stakeholder approach to NRS has been adopted, allowing to capture this complexity more comprehensively. However, limited research has focused on the distinct key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics considered valuable by different stakeholders in evaluating NRS. Based on 11 interviews conducted with different professionals from two commercial media organizations in Flanders and The Netherlands, this paper shows that stakeholders prioritize different KPIs and metrics related to the reach-engagement-conversion-retention funnel. The evaluation of NRS performance is often limited to short-term metrics like CTR, overlooking the multiplicity of stakeholders involved. Our findings reveal how different purposes, KPIs, and metrics are valued from the journalistic, commercial, and tech logic. In doing so, this paper contributes to the multi-stakeholder approach to NRS, advancing our understanding of the real-world complexity of NRS development and evaluation.</p>

    <h3>Measuring and Mitigating Bias and Harm in Personalized Advertising (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Ali</p>
    <p>Online personalized advertising is often very effective in identifying relevant audiences for each piece of content, which has led to its widespread adoption. In today’s internet, however, these advertising systems are used not only to market products, but also consequential life opportunities such as employment or housing, as well as socially important political messaging. This has led to increasing concerns about the presence of algorithmic bias and possible discrimination in these important domains — with results showing problematic biases along gender, race, and political affiliation, even when the advertiser might have targeted broadly.<br>A growing body of work focuses on measuring and characterizing these biases, as well as finding ways to mitigate these effects and building responsible systems. However, these results often emerge from different scientific communities and are often disconnected in the literature. In this paper, I attempt at bridging the gap between isolated efforts to either measure these biases, or to mitigate them. I discuss how the need to measure bias in advertising, and the efforts to mitigate it, despite being distant in the literature, are complementary problems that need to center their methodolgy around user studies.<br>This paper presents a research agenda that focuses on the need for user-centric measurements of bias, by collecting real ads from users, and using surveys to understand user perceptions for these ads. My approach also calls for incorporating user sentiments into the mitigation efforts, by constraining optimization on user values that emerge from surveys. Finally, I also emphasize the need for involving users in the evaluation of responsible advertising systems; efforts to mitigate bias eventually need to be contextualized in terms of benefits to users instead of simple performance tradeoffs. My focus on the users is motivated by the fact that they are stakeholders in personalized advertising, vulnerable at the hand of algorithmic bias and harm, and therefore crucial in both efforts to measure and mitigate these effects.</p>
