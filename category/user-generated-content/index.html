    <h3>Co-optimize Content Generation and Consumption in a Large Scale Video Recommendation System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuening Li, Mingyan Gao, Qingyun Liu, Sourabh Bansod, Shuchao Bi, Liang Liu, Yaping Zhang, Zhen Zhang</p>
    <p>Multi-task prediction models and value models are the de-facto standard ranking components in modern large-scale content recommendation systems. However, they are typically optimized to model users’ passive consumption behaviors, and rank content in a way to grow only consumption-centric values. In this talk, we discuss the key insight that it is possible to model sparse participatory content-generation actions as well and grow ecosystem value through a new ranking system. We made the following key technical contributions in this system: (1) introducing ranking for content generation based on a categorization of user participation actions of different sparsity, including proxy intent action or access point clicks. (2) improving sparse task prediction quality and stability by causal task relationship modeling, conditional loss modeling and ResNet based shared bottom network. (3) personalizing the value model to minimize conflicts between different values, through e.g. ranking inspiring content higher for users who actively generate content. (4) conducting systematic evaluation of proposed approach in a large short-form video UGC (User-Generated Content) platform.</p>

    <h3>Learning Consumer and Producer Embeddings for User-Generated Content Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian McAuley, Wang-Cheng Kang</p>
    <p>User-Generated Content (UGC) is at the core of web applications where users can both produce and consume content. This differs from traditional e-Commerce domains where content producers and consumers are usually from two separate groups. In this work, we propose a method CPRec (consumer and producer based recommendation), for recommending content on UGC-based platforms. Specifically, we learn a core embedding for each user and two transformation matrices to project the user’s core embedding into two ‘role’ embeddings (i.e., a producer and consumer role). We model each interaction by the ternary relation between the consumer, the consumed item, and its producer. Empirical studies on two large-scale UGC applications show that our method outperforms standard collaborative filtering methods as well as recent methods that model producer information via item features.</p>

    <h3>Is Readability a Valuable Signal for Hashtag Recommendations? (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Soledad Pera, Ion Madrazo</p>
    <p>We present an initial study oriented to examine the benefits of considering readability indicators in addressing social network-related tasks. In order to do so, we introduce TweetRead, a readability assessment tool specifically designed for Twitter, and use it to inform the hashtag prediction process, highlighting the importance of a readability signal in recommendation tasks.</p>

    <h3>Tip Ranker: A M.L. Approach to Ranking Short Reviews (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enrique Cruz, Berk Kapicioglu</p>
    <p>Foursquare is a local search and discovery app where as part of the experience users leave tips, short reviews and suggestions to help other users find great places. This poster summarizes the strategy we use to select the best tips for a given venue. Our new ranking model to select the tips that provide our users with the most informative and high quality content. The introduction of the new model yielded significant and positive results in our metrics from various applications within the Foursquare app ecosystem.</p>

    <h3>Analysis of User-generated Content for Improving YouTube Video Recommendation (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabio Gasparetti, Davide Feltoni Gurini, Alessandro Micarelli, Giuseppe Sansonetti, Michele Galli</p>
    <p>Everyday video-sharing websites such as YouTube collect large amounts of new multimedia resources. Comments left by viewers often provide valuable information to describe sentiments, opinions and tastes of users. For this reason, we propose a novel re-ranking approach that takes into consideration that information in order to provide better recommendations of related videos. Early experiments indicate an improvement in the recommendation performance.</p>

    <h3>Recommending User Generated Item Lists (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min Xie, Yidan Liu, Laks V.S. Lakshmanan</p>
    <p>Existing recommender systems mostly focus on recommending individual items which users may be interested in. User-generated item lists on the other hand have become a popular feature in many applications. E.g., Goodreads provides users with an interface for creating and sharing interesting book lists. These user-generated item lists complement the main functionality of the corresponding application, and intuitively become an alternative way for users to browse and discover interesting items to be consumed. Unfortunately, existing recommender systems are not designed for recommending user-generated item lists. In this work, we study properties of these user-generated item lists and propose a Bayesian ranking model, called \LRM for recommending them. The proposed \LRM model takes into consideration users’ previous interactions with both item lists and with individual items. Furthermore, we propose in \LRM a novel way of weighting items within item lists based on both position of items, and personalized list consumption pattern. Through extensive experiments on real item list dataset from Goodreads, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed \LRM model.</p>
