    <h3>Oh, Behave! Country Representation Dynamics Created by Feedback Loops in Music Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Kowald, Markus Schedl, Oleg Lesota, Jonas Geiger, Max Walder</p>
    <p>Recent work suggests that music recommender systems are prone to disproportionally frequent recommendations of music from countries more prominently represented in the training data, notably the US. However, it remains unclear to what extent feedback loops in music recommendation influence the dynamics of such imbalance. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of representation of local (i.e., country-specific) and US-produced music in user profiles and recommendations. To this end, we conduct a feedback loop simulation study using the standardized LFM-2b dataset. The results suggest that most of the investigated recommendation models decrease the proportion of music from local artists in their recommendations. Furthermore, we find that models preserving average proportions of US and local music do not necessarily provide country-calibrated recommendations. We also look into popularity calibration and, surprisingly, find that the most popularity-calibrated model in our study (ItemKNN) provides the least country-calibrated recommendations. In addition, users from less represented countries (e.g., Finland) are, in the long term, most affected by the under-representation of their local music in recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Integrating Matrix Factorization with Graph based Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rachana Mehta</p>
    <p>Graph based Recommender models make use of user-item rating and user-user social relationships to elicit recommendation performance by extracting inherent geometrical knowledge. In a social graph scenario, user-user trust plays a significant role in reducing sparsity and has varied characteristics that can be exploited. Existing models limit themselves to learning from either a high order interaction graph of user-item ratings or a user-user social graph from trust value. They explore other trust characteristics in a very limited setting. The graph based model, designed using entire user-user social information, impacts performance and escalates complexities in model learning. To alleviate these issues of graph learning, graph recommender seeks assistance from matrix factorization techniques. Incorporating graph based model with matrix factorization brings its own set of challenges of model integration, leveraging trust, graph learning, and optimization. This article presents the existing work in that line and future possibilities and challenges to be catered to through novel developments</p>

    <h3>Uncovering ChatGPT’s Capabilities in Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihua Si, Chen Xu, Haiyuan Zhao, Xiao Zhang, Weijie Yu, Zhongxiang Sun, Jun Xu, Ninglu Shao, Sunhao Dai</p>
    <p>The debut of ChatGPT has recently attracted significant attention from the natural language processing (NLP) community and beyond. Existing studies have demonstrated that ChatGPT shows significant improvement in a range of downstream NLP tasks, but the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in terms of recommendations remain unclear. In this study, we aim to enhance ChatGPT’s recommendation capabilities by aligning it with traditional information retrieval (IR) ranking capabilities, including point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise ranking. To achieve this goal, we re-formulate the aforementioned three recommendation policies into prompt formats tailored specifically to the domain at hand.  Through extensive experiments on four datasets from different domains, we analyze the distinctions among the three recommendation policies. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT achieves an optimal balance between cost and performance when equipped with list-wise ranking. This research sheds light on a promising direction for aligning ChatGPT with recommendation tasks. To facilitate further explorations in this area, the full code and detailed original results are open-sourced at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM4RS-532C/}.</p>

    <h3>Incorporating Time in Sequential Recommendation Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Caverlee, Mostafa Rahmani, Fei Wang</p>
    <p>Sequential models are designed to learn sequential patterns in data based on the chronological order of user interactions. However, they often ignore the timestamps of these interactions. Incorporating time is crucial because many sequential patterns are time-dependent, and the model cannot make time-aware recommendations without considering time. This article demonstrates that providing a rich representation of time can significantly improve the performance of sequential models. The existing literature treats time as a one-dimensional time-series obtained by quantizing time. In this study, we propose treating time as a multi-dimensional time-series and explore representation learning methods, including  a kernel based method and an embedding-based algorithm. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the inclusion of time significantly enhances the model’s performance, and multi-dimensional methods outperform the one-dimensional method by a substantial margin.</p>

    <h3>Large-Scale Modeling of Mobile User Click Behaviors Using Deep Learning (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Li, Xin Zhou</p>
    <p>Modeling tap or click sequences of users on a mobile device can improve our understandings of interaction behavior and offers opportunities for UI optimization by recommending next element the user might want to click on. We analyzed a large-scale dataset of over 20 million clicks from more than 4,000 mobile users who opted in. We then designed a deep learning model that predicts the next element that the user clicks given the user’s click history, the structural information of the UI screen, and the current context such as the time of the day. We thoroughly investigated the deep model by comparing it with a set of baseline methods based on the dataset. The experiments show that our model achieves 48% and 71% accuracy (top-1 and top-3) for predicting next clicks based on a held-out dataset of test users, which significantly outperformed all the baseline methods with a large margin. We discussed a few scenarios for integrating the model in mobile interaction and how users can potentially benefit from the model.</p>

    <h3>A Federated Recommender System for Online Services (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Tan, Qiang Yang, Vincent Zheng, Bo Liu</p>
    <p>Due to privacy and security constraints, directly sharing user data between parties is undesired. Such decentralized data silo issues commonly exist in recommender systems. In general, recommender systems are data-driven. The more data it uses, the better performance it obtains. The data silo issues is a severe limitation of the recommender’s performance. Federated learning is an emerging technology, which bridges the data silos and builds machine learning models without compromising user privacy and data security. We design a recommender system based on federated learning. It is known as the federated recommender system. The system implements plenty of popular algorithms to support various online recommendation services. The algorithm implementation is open-sourced. We also deploy the system on a real-world content recommendation application, achieving significant performance improvement. In this demonstration, we present the architecture of the federated recommender system and give an online demo to show its detailed working procedures and results in content recommendations.</p>

    <h3>DRecPy: A Python Framework for Developing Deep Learning-Based Recommenders (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Márcia Barros, Francisco M. Couto, Fábio Colaço</p>
    <p>Frameworks that aid the development of Recommender Systems (RSs) are extremely important, since they reduce their development cost by offering reusable tools, as well as implementations of common strategies and popular models. However, it is still hard to find a framework that also provides full abstraction over data set conversion, support for deep learning-based approaches, extensible models and reproducible evaluations. This work introduces a new framework that not only provides several modules to avoid repetitive development work, but also to assist practitioners with these existing challenges. Our evaluation procedure ensures that RSs developed using this new approach are consistent and extensible, by analysing their predictive performance and certain characteristics of their implementation.</p>

    <h3>Learning Representations of Hierarchical Slates in Collaborative Filtering (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashok Chandrashekar, Ehtsham Elahi</p>
    <p>We are interested in building collaborative filtering models for recommendation systems where users interact with slates instead of individual items. These slates can be hierarchical in nature. The central idea of our approach is to learn low dimensional embeddings of these slates. We present a novel way to learn these embeddings by making use of the (unknown) statistics of the underlying distribution generating the hierarchical data. Our representation learning algorithm can be viewed as a simple composition rule that can be applied recursively in a bottom-up fashion to represent arbitrarily complex hierarchical structures in terms of the representations of its constituent components. We demonstrate our ideas on two real world recommendation systems datasets including the one used for the RecSys 2019 challenge. For that dataset, we improve upon the performance achieved by the winning team’s model by incorporating embeddings as features generated by our approach in their solution.</p>

    <h3>Recommendations as Graph Explorations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marialena Kyriakidi, Yannis Ioannidis, Georgia Koutrika</p>
    <p>We argue that most recommendation approaches can be abstracted as a graph exploration problem. In particular, we describe a graph-theoretic framework with two primary parts: (a) a recommendation graph, modeling all the elements of an (application) domain from a recommendation perspective, including the subjects and objects of recommendations as well as the relationships between them; (b) a set of path operations, inferring new edges, i.e., implicit or unknown relationships, by traversing and combining paths on the graph. The resulting path algebra model provides an abstraction and a common foundation that is beneficial to three aspects of recommendations: (a) expressive power - expression and subsequent use of several significantly different, existing but also novel recommendation approaches is reduced to parameterizing a unique model; (b) usability - by capturing part of the recommendation mechanisms in the underlying path algebra semantics, specification of recommendation approaches becomes easier and less tedious; (c) processing speed - implementing recommender systems on top of graph engines opens up the door for several optimizations that speed up execution. We demonstrate the above benefits by expressing several categories of recommendation approaches in the path algebra model and benchmarking some of them in a recommender system implemented on top of Neo4J, a widely used graph system.</p>

    <h3>Item Recommendation on Monotonic Behavior Chains (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mengting Wan, Julian McAuley</p>
    <p>‘Explicit’ and ‘implicit’ feedback in recommender systems have been studied for many years, as two relatively isolated areas. However many real-world systems involve a spectrum of both implicit and explicit signals, ranging from clicks and purchases, to ratings and reviews. A natural question is whether implicit signals (which are dense but noisy) might help to predict explicit signals (which are sparse but reliable), or vice versa. Thus in this paper, we propose an item recommendation framework which jointly models this spectrum of interactions. Our main observation is that in many settings, feedback signals exhibit monotonic dependency structures, i.e., any signal necessarily implies the presence of a weaker (or more implicit) signal (a ‘review’ action implies a ‘purchase’ action, which implies a ‘click’ action, etc.). We refer to these structures as ‘monotonic behavior chains,’ for which we develop new algorithms that exploit these dependencies. Using several new and existing datasets that exhibit a variety of feedback types, we demonstrate the quantitative performance of our approaches. We also perform qualitative analysis to uncover the relationships between different stages of implicit vs. explicit signals.</p>

    <h3>Deep Learning Marketplace Recommenders in Online Experiments (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simen Eide, Ning Zhou</p>
    <p>Marketplaces are platforms where users buy and sell various types of items. Recommendation systems are widely used in marketplaces to match users with items relevant to their interests and needs. This paper focuses on online experiments with deep neural network recommenders and presents the promising recommenders we found – hybrid item representation models combining features from traffic and content, sequence-based models, and multi-armed bandit models that optimize user engagement by re-ranking proposals from multiple submodels. Then it summarizes the online experiment results and discusses why some recommenders outperform others.</p>

    <h3>Using Explainability for Constrained Matrix Factorization (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olfa Nasraoui, Behnoush Abdollahi</p>
    <p>Accurate model-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches tend to be black-box machine learning models, such as Matrix Factorization (MF), that lack interpretability and do not provide a straightforward explanation for their outputs. Yet explanations can improve the transparency of a recommender system by justifying recommendations, and this in turn can enhance the user’s trust in the recommendations. Hence, one main challenge in designing a recommender system is mitigating the trade-off between an explainable technique with moderate prediction accuracy and a more accurate technique with no explainable recommendations. In this paper, we focus on MF and further assume the absence of any additional data source, such as item content or user attributes. We propose an explainability constrained MF technique that computes the top-n recommendation list from items that are explainable. Experimental results show that our method is effective in generating accurate and explainable recommendations.</p>

    <h3>TransNets: Learning to Transform for Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rose Catherine, William Cohen</p>
    <p>Recently, deep learning methods have been shown to improve the performance of recommender systems over traditional methods, especially when review text is available.  For example, a recent model, DeepCoNN, uses neural nets to learn one latent representation for the text of all reviews written by a target user, and a second latent representation for the text of all reviews for a target item, and then combines these latent representations to obtain state-of-the-art performance on recommendation tasks.  We show that (unsurprisingly) much of the predictive value of review text comes from reviews of the target user for the target item. We then introduce a way in which this information can be used in recommendation, even when the target user’s review for the target item is not available.  Our model, called TransNets, extends the DeepCoNN model by introducing an additional latent layer representing the target user-target item pair.  We then regularize this layer, at training time, to be similar to another latent representation of the target user’s review of the target item.  We show that TransNets and extensions of it improve substantially over the previous state-of-the-art.</p>

    <p>This paper introduces pyRecLab, a software library written in C++ with Python bindings which allows to quickly train, test and develop recommender systems. Although there are several software libraries for this purpose, only a few let developers to get quickly started with the most traditional methods, permitting them to try different parameters and approach several tasks without a significant loss of performance. Among the few libraries that have all these features, they are available in languages such as Java, Scala or C#, what is a disadvantage for less experienced programmers more used to the popular Python programming language. In this article we introduce details of pyRecLab, showing as well performance analysis in terms of error metrics (MAE and RMSE) and train/test time. We benchmark it against the popular Java-based library LibRec, showing similar results. We expect programmers with little experience and people interested in quickly prototyping recommender systems to be benefited from pyRecLab.</p>

    <p>In real-world scenarios, recommenders face non-functional requirements of technical nature and must handle dynamic data in the form of sequential streams. Evaluation of recommender systems must take these issues into account in order to be maximally informative. In this paper, we present a framework called Idomaar which enables the efficient multi-dimensional benchmarking of recommender algorithms. Idomaar goes beyond current academic research practices by creating a realistic evaluation environment and computing both effectiveness and technical metrics for stream-based as well as set based evaluation. The potentials of the framework are illustrated in a scenario that focuses on the “research to prototyping to productization” cycle at a company. We show that Idomaar simplifies the testing with different configurations and supports the flexible integration of different data.</p>
