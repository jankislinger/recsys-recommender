    <h3>Evaluating The Effects of Calibrated Popularity Bias Mitigation: A Field Study (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Astrid Tessem, Anastasiia Klimashevskaia, Dietmar Jannach, Lars Skjærven, Christoph Trattner, Mehdi Elahi</p>
    <p>Despite their proven various benefits, Recommender Systems can cause or amplify certain undesired effects. In this paper, we focus on Popularity Bias, i.e., the tendency of a recommender system to utilize the effect of recommending popular items to the user. Prior research has studied the negative impact of this type of bias on individuals and society as a whole and proposed various approaches to mitigate this in various domains. However, almost all works adopted offline methodologies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Unfortunately, such offline simulations can potentially be rather simplified and unable to capture the full picture. To contribute to this line of research and given a particular lack of knowledge about how debiasing approaches work not only offline, but online as well, we present in this paper the results of user study on a national broadcaster movie streaming platform in [country]1, i.e., [platform], following the A/B testing methodology. We deployed an effective mitigation approach for popularity bias, called Calibrated Popularity (CP), and monitored its performance in comparison to the platform’s existing collaborative filtering recommendation approach as a baseline over a period of almost four months. The results obtained from a large user base interacting in real-time with the recommendations indicate that the evaluated debiasing approach can be effective in addressing popularity bias while still maintaining the level of user interest and engagement</p>

    <h3>Biases in Recommendation System (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saumya Bhadani</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems shape what people consume and experience online, which makes it critical to assess their effect on society and whether they are affected by any potential source of bias. My research focuses on a specific source of bias — popularity — that is especially relevant in two online contexts: news consumption, and cultural markets. Social media newsfeeds, which are designed to optimize the engagement of users, may inadvertently promote inaccurate and partisan news domains, since these are often popular among like-minded and polarized audiences. More generally, in any type of cultural market, popularity bias may lead to the suppression of niche quality products, which may not attract enough attention. In the context of online newsfeeds, I am investigating whether the political diversity of the audience of a news website can be used as signal of journalistic quality. In an analysis of a comprehensive dataset of news source reliability ratings and web browsing histories, I have shown that the diversity of the audience of a news website is a valuable signal to counter popularity bias and to promote journalistic quality. To further validate these results experimentally, I propose to have direct interactions with social media users through surveys. Here, I provide the details of a field study that I am planning to undertake using an experimental social media platform. More generally, in the context of any online cultural market, political audience diversity may not be applicable but the idea of diversity as a signal for higher quality might still be useful. For example, movies which are liked by an “age diverse” population or books which are read by racially diverse audience may have better quality than other items. However, in this research I have explored audience diversity in the context of social media newsfeeds only. For any online cultural market, I propose a method to quantify the popularity bias through an empirical analysis, using data from several existing markets. Accurately estimating the impact of popularity bias can help us advance our understanding of machine biases and also lead to the development of more robust recommendation systems.</p>

    <h3>A Field Study of Related Video Recommendations: Newest, Most Similar, or Most Relevant (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Maxwell Harper, Yifan Zhong, Qian Zhao, Vikas Kumar, Tahir Lazaro Sousa Menezes</p>
    <p>Many video sites recommend videos related to the one a user is watching. These recommendations have been shown to influence what users end up exploring and are an important part of a recommender system. Plenty of methods have been proposed to recommend related videos, but there has been relatively little work that compares competing strategies. We describe a field study of related video recommendations, where we deploy algorithms to recommend related videos in a movie trailer viewing interface. Our results show that non-personalized algorithms yield the highest click-through rates, while the algorithm prioritizing recency is the strongest in leading to trailer-level user engagement. Our findings suggest the potential to design non-personalized yet effective related item recommendation strategies.</p>

    <h3>Deep Auto-Encoding for Context-Aware Inference of Preferred Items’ Categories (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moshe Unger, Lior Rokach, Bracha Shapira, Ariel Bar</p>
    <p>Context-aware systems enable the sensing and analysis of user context in order to provide personalized services to users. We observed that it is possible to automatically learn contextual factors and behavioral patterns when users interact with the system. We later utilize the learned patterns to infer contextual user interests within a recommender system. We present a novel context-aware model for detecting users’ preferred items’ categories using an unsupervised deep learning technique applied to mobile sensor data. We train an auto-encoder for each item genre, using contextual data that was obtained when users interacted with the system. Given new contextual sensor data from a user, the discovered patterns from each auto-encoder are used to predict the category of items that should be recommended to the user in the given context. In order to collect rich contextual data, we conducted an extensive field study over a period of four weeks with a group of ninety users. The analysis reveals significant insights regarding the inference of different granularity levels of categories that are available within the data.</p>
