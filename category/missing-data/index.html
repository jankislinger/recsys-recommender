    <h3>Using Taste Groups for Collaborative Filtering (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nevin L. Zhang, Farhan Khawar</p>
    <p>Implicit feedback is the simplest form of user feedback that can be used for item recommendation. It is easy to collect and domain independent. However, there is a lack of negative examples. Existing works circumvent this problem by making various assumptions regarding the unconsumed items, which fail to hold when the user did not consume an item because she was unaware of it. In this paper, we propose as a novel method for addressing the lack of negative examples in implicit feedback. The motivation is that if there is a large group of users who share the same taste and none of them consumed an item, then it is highly likely that the item is irrelevant to this taste. We use Hierarchical Latent Tree Analysis(HLTA) to identify taste-based user groups and make recommendations for a user based on her memberships in the groups.</p>

    <h3>Folding: Why Good Models Sometimes Make Spurious Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Mayoraz, Karthik Lakshmanan, John R. Anderson, Hubert Pham, Doris Xin</p>
    <p>In recommender systems based on low rank factorization of a partially observed user-item matrix, a common phenomenon that plagues many otherwise effective models is the interleaving of good and spurious recommendations in the top-K results. A single incongruous recommendation can dramatically impact the perceived quality of a recommender system. In this work, we investigate folding, a major contributing factor to spurious recommendations. Folding refers to the unintentional overlap of disparate groups of users and items in the low-rank embedding vector space, induced by improper handling of missing data. We formally define a metric that quantifies the severity of folding in a trained system, to assist in diagnosing its potential to shock users with inappropriate recommendations. The folding metric complements existing information retrieval metrics that focus on the number of good recommendations and their ranks but ignore the impact of undesired recommendations. We motivate our definition of the folding metric on synthetic data and evaluate its effectiveness on both synthetic and real world datasets. We study the relationship between the folding metric and other characteristics of recommender systems and observe that optimizing for goodness metrics can lead to high folding and thus more spurious recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Top-N Recommendation with Missing Implicit Feedback (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gert Lanckriet, Daryl Lim, Julian McAuley</p>
    <p>In implicit feedback datasets, non-interaction of a user with an item does not necessarily indicate that an item is irrelevant for the user. Thus, evaluation measures computed on the observed feedback may not accurately reflect performance on the complete data. In this paper, we discuss a missing data model for implicit feedback and propose a novel evaluation measure oriented towards Top-N recommendation. Our evaluation measure admits unbiased estimation under our missing data model, unlike the popular Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) measure. We also derive an efficient algorithm to optimize the measure on the training data. We run several experiments which demonstrate the utility of our proposed measure.</p>
