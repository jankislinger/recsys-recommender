    <h3>One-class Matrix Factorization: Point-Wise Regression-Based or Pair-Wise Ranking-Based? (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Wei Chen, Chih-Jen Lin</p>
    <p>One-class matrix factorization (MF) is an important technique for recommender systems with implicit feedback. In one widely used setting, a regression function is fit in a point-wise manner on observed and some unobserved (user, item) entries. Recently, in AAAI 2019, Chen et al. [2] proposed a pair-wise ranking-based approach for observed (user, item) entries to be compared against unobserved ones. They concluded that the pair-wise setting performs consistently better than the more traditional point-wise setting. However, after some detailed investigation, we explain by mathematical derivations that their method may perform only similar to the point-wise ones. We also identified some problems when reproducing their experimental results. After considering suitable settings, we rigorously compare point-wise and pair-wise one-class MFs, and show that the pair-wise method is actually not better. Therefore, for one-class MF, the more traditional and mature point-wise setting should still be considered. Our findings contradict the conclusions in [2] and serve as a call for caution when researchers are comparing between two machine learning methods.</p>

    <h3>Towards Understanding Latent Factors and User Profiles by Enhancing Matrix Factorization with Tags (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jürgen Ziegler, Tim Donkers, Benedikt Loepp</p>
    <p>With the interactive recommending approach we have recently proposed, users are given more control over model-based Collaborative Filtering while the results are perceived as more transparent. Integrating the latent factors derived by Matrix Factorization with tags users provided for the items has, however, even more advantages. In this paper, we show how general understanding of the abstract factor space, and of user and item positions inside it, can benefit from the semantics introduced by considering additional information. Moreover, our approach allows us to explain the user’s (former latent) preference profile by means of tags.</p>
