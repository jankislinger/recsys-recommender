    <h3>Enhancing Recommendation Quality of the SASRec Model by Mitigating Popularity Bias (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xenija Neufeld, Sebastian Loth, Andreas Grün, Venkata Harshit Koneru</p>
    <p>ZDF is a Public Service Media (PSM) broadcaster in Germany that uses recommender systems on its streaming service platform ZDFmediathek. One of the main use cases within the ZDFmediathek is Next Video, which is currently based on a Self-Attention based Sequential Recommendation model (SASRec). For this use case, we modified the loss function, the sampling method of negative items, and introduced the top-k negative sampling strategy and compared this to the vanilla SASRec model. We show that this not only reduces popularity bias, but also increases clicks and the viewing volume compared to that of the vanilla version.</p>

    <h3>Translating the Public Service Media Remit into Metrics and Algorithms (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Grün, Xenija Neufeld</p>
    <p>After multiple years of providing automated video recommendations in the ZDFmediathek, ZDF has established a solid ground for the usage of recommender systems. Being a Public Service Media (PSM) provider, our most important driver on this journey is our Public Service Media Remit (PSMR). We are committed to cultivate PSM values such as diversity, fairness, and transparency while providing fresh and relevant content. Therefore, it is important for us to not only measure the success of our recommender systems in terms of basic business Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as clicks and viewing minutes but also to ensure and to measure the achievement of PSM values. While speaking about PSM values, however, it is important to keep in mind that there is no easy way to directly measure values as such. In order to be able to measure their extent in a recommender system, we need to translate these values into public value metrics. However, not only the final results are essential for the PSMR. Additionally, it is highly important to establish transparency while working towards these results, that is, while defining the data, the algorithms, and the pipelines used in recommender systems. In our talk we will provide a deeper insight into how we approach this task with Model Cards and give an overview of some models, their Model Cards, and metrics that we are currently using for ZDFmediathek.</p>

    <h3>Measuring Commonality in Recommendation of Cultural Content: Recommender Systems to Enhance Cultural Citizenship (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georgina E. M. Born, Gustavo Ferreira, Fernando Diaz, Andres Ferraro</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have become the dominant means of curating cultural content, significantly influencing the nature of individual cultural experience. While the majority of academic and industrial research on recommender systems optimizes for personalized user experience, this paradigm does not capture the ways that recommender systems impact cultural experience in the aggregate, across populations of users. Although existing novelty, diversity, and fairness studies probe how recommender systems relate to the broader social role of cultural content, they do not adequately center culture as a core concept and challenge. In this work, we introduce commonality as a new measure of recommender systems that reflects the degree to which recommendations familiarize a given user population with specified categories of cultural content. Our proposed commonality metric responds to a set of arguments developed through an interdisciplinary dialogue between researchers in computer science and the social sciences and humanities. With reference to principles underpinning non-profit, public service media (PSM) systems in democratic societies, we identify universality of address and content diversity in the service of strengthening cultural citizenship as particularly relevant goals for recommender systems delivering cultural content. Taking diversity in movie recommendation as a case study in enhancing pluralistic cultural experience, we empirically compare the performance of recommendation algorithms using commonality and existing utility, diversity, novelty, and fairness metrics. Our results demonstrate that commonality captures a property of system behavior complementary to existing metrics and suggest the need for alternative, non-personalized interventions in recommender systems oriented to strengthening cultural citizenship across populations of users. In this way, commonality contributes to a growing body of scholarship developing ‘public good’ rationales for digital media and machine learning systems.</p>

    <h3>Challenges Experienced in Public Service Media Recommendation Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Grün</p>
    <p>After multiple years of successfully applying recommendation algorithms at ZDF, a German Public Service Media provider, we have faced certain challenges in regards to the optimization of our systems and the resulting recommendations. The design and the optimization of our systems are guided by various, partially competing objectives and are, therefore, influenced by various factors. Similarly to commercial video on demand services, ZDF is interested in binding its audience by providing personalized recommendations in its streaming media service. However, more importantly, as a Public Service Media provider, we are committed to offer diverse, universal, unbiased, and transparent recommendations while following established editorial guidelines and strict privacy regulations. Additionally, we are committed to provide environmentally-friendly or green recommendations optimizing our systems for run time and power consumption. With the intent to start a public discussion, we describe the challenges that arise when optimizing Public Service Media recommendation systems towards machine learning metrics, business Key Performance Indicators, Public Service Media values, and run-time simultaneously, while aiming to keep the results transparent.</p>
