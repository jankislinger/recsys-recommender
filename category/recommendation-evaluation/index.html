    <h3>Δ-OPE: Off-Policy Estimation with Pairs of Policies (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksei Ustimenko, Olivier Jeunen</p>
    <p>The off-policy paradigm casts recommendation as a counterfactual decision-making task, allowing practitioners to unbiasedly estimate online metrics using offline data. This leads to effective evaluation metrics, as well as learning procedures that directly optimise online success. Nevertheless, the high variance that comes with unbiased- ness is typically the crux that complicates practical applications. An important insight is that the difference between policy values can often be estimated with significantly reduced variance, if said policies have positive covariance. This allows us to formulate a pairwise off-policy estimation task: Δ-OPE. Δ-OPE subsumes the common use-case of estimating improve- ments of a learnt policy over a production policy, using data col- lected by a stochastic logging policy. We introduce Δ-OPE methods based on the widely used Inverse Propensity Scoring estimator and its extensions. Moreover, we characterise a variance-optimal additive control variate that further enhances efficiency. Simulated, offline, and online experiments show that our methods significantly improve performance for both evaluation and learning tasks.</p>

    <h3>Data Masking for Recommender Systems: Prediction Performance and Rating Hiding (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martha Larson, Alan Hanjalic, Manel Slokom</p>
    <p>Data science challenges allow companies, and other data holders, to collaborate with the wider research community. In the area of recommender systems, the potential of such challenges to move forward the state of the art is limited due to concerns about releasing user interaction data. This paper investigates the potential of privacy-preserving data publishing for supporting recommender system challenges. We propose a data masking algorithm, Shuffle-NNN, with two steps: Neighborhood selection and value swapping. Neighborhood selection preserves valuable item similarity information. The data shuffling technique hides (ie, changes) ratings of users for individual items. Our experimental results demonstrate that the relative performance of algorithms, which is the key property that a data science challenge must measure, is comparable between the original data and the data masked with Shuffle-NNN.</p>

    <h3>BERT, ELMo, USE and InferSent Sentence Encoders: The Panacea for Research-Paper Recommendation? (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Micarelli, Giuseppe Sansonetti, Joeran Beel, Fabio Gasparetti, Hebatallah A. Mohamed Hassan</p>
    <p>Content-based approaches to research paper recommendation are important when user feedback is sparse or not available. The task of content-based matching is challenging, mainly due to the problem of determining the semantic similarity of texts. Nowadays, there exist many sentence embedding models that learn deep semantic representations by being trained on huge corpora, aiming to provide transfer learning to a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. In this work, we present a comparative evaluation among five well-known pre-trained sentence encoders deployed in the pipeline of title-based research paper recommendation. The experimented encoders are USE, BERT, InferSent, ELMo, and SciBERT. For our study, we propose a methodology for evaluating such models in reranking BM25-based recommendations. The experimental results show that the sole consideration of semantic information from these encoders does not lead to improved recommendation performance over the traditional BM25 technique, while their integration enables the retrieval of a set of relevant papers that may not be retrieved by the BM25 ranking function.</p>

    <h3>Exploring Author Gender in Book Rating and Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hoda Mehrpouyan, Mohammed Imran R. Kazi, Michael D. Ekstrand, Mucun Tian, Daniel Kluver</p>
    <p>Collaborative filtering algorithms find useful patterns in rating and consumption data and exploit these patterns to guide users to good items. Many of the patterns in rating datasets reflect important real-world differences between the various users and items in the data; other patterns may be irrelevant or possibly undesirable for social or ethical reasons, particularly if they reflect undesired discrimination, such as discrimination in publishing or purchasing against authors who are women or ethnic minorities. In this work, we examine the response of collaborative filtering recommender algorithms to the distribution of their input data with respect to a dimension of social concern, namely content creator gender. Using publicly-available book ratings data, we measure the distribution of the genders of the authors of books in user rating profiles and recommendation lists produced from this data. We find that common collaborative filtering algorithms differ in the gender distribution of their recommendation lists, and in the relationship of that output distribution to user profile distribution.</p>

    <h3>Who is Really Affected by Fraudulent Reviews? (2018)</h3>

    <h3>Meta-Prod2Vec – Product Embeddings Using Side-Information for Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elena Smirnova, Alexis Conneau, Flavian Vasile</p>
    <p>We propose Meta-Prod2vec, a novel method to compute item similarities for recommendation that leverages existing item metadata. Such scenarios are frequently encountered in applications such as content recommendation, ad targeting and web search. Our method leverages past user interactions with items and their attributes to compute low-dimensional embeddings of items. Specifically, the item metadata is in- jected into the model as side information to regularize the item embeddings. We show that the new item representa- tions lead to better performance on recommendation tasks on an open music dataset.</p>

    <h3>Analysis of User-generated Content for Improving YouTube Video Recommendation (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabio Gasparetti, Davide Feltoni Gurini, Alessandro Micarelli, Giuseppe Sansonetti, Michele Galli</p>
    <p>Everyday video-sharing websites such as YouTube collect large amounts of new multimedia resources. Comments left by viewers often provide valuable information to describe sentiments, opinions and tastes of users. For this reason, we propose a novel re-ranking approach that takes into consideration that information in order to provide better recommendations of related videos. Early experiments indicate an improvement in the recommendation performance.</p>
