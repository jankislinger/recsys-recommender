    <h3>Content-Collaborative Disentanglement Representation Learning for Enhanced Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yin Zhang, Yun He, James Caverlee, Ziwei Zhu</p>
    <p>Modern recommenders usually consider both collaborative features from user behavior data (e.g., clicks) and content information about the users and items (e.g., user ages or item images) for improved recommendations. While encouraging, the uncovered user preference representations derived from these collaborative and content-based perspectives can be entangled by intermixing the influence from each other, leading to sub-optimal performance and unstable recommendations. Hence, we propose to disentangle representations learned from user behavior data and content information. Specifically, we propose a novel two-level disentanglement generative recommendation model (DICER) that supports both content-collaborative disentanglement and feature disentanglement: for the content-collaborative disentanglement, DICER decomposes the features by their marginal distributions based on content and user-item interactions, to ensure the learned features from each type are statistically independent. For feature disentanglement, by decomposing the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we theoretically show that extracted features within each type are disentangled at a granular level. Furthermore, DICER utilizes a co-decoder that simultaneously decodes the content and user-item interactions to ensure the high-quality of learned features. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, results show that DICER significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by 13.5% in NDCG and 14.4% in hit ratio on average.</p>

    <h3>Gaussian Ranking by Matrix Factorization (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harald Steck</p>
    <p>The ranking quality at the top of the list is crucial in many real-world applications of recommender systems. In this paper, we present a novel framework that allows for pointwise as well as listwise training with respect to various ranking metrics. This is based on a training objective function where we assume that, for given a user, the recommender system predicts scores for all items that follow approximately a distribution. We motivate this assumption from the properties of implicit feedback data. As a model, we use matrix factorization and extend it by non-linear activation functions, as customary in the literature of artificial neural networks. In particular, we use non-linear activation functions derived from our Gaussian assumption. Our preliminary experimental results show that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods with respect to optimizing the Area under the ROC curve, while it is particularly effective in optimizing the head of the ranked list.</p>

    <h3>Content Driven User Profiling for Comment-Worthy Recommendations of News and Blog Articles (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mrinal Das, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Trapit Bansal</p>
    <p>We consider the problem of recommending articles such as news and blog-posts. An article is defined to be comment-worthy for a particular user if that user is interested to leave a comment on it. We note that recommending comment-worthy articles calls for elicitation of of the user from the of both the articles and the past comments made by users. We thus propose to develop user profiles to elicit these latent interests of users in commenting and use them to recommend articles for future commenting. The difficulty of modeling comment content and the varied nature of users’ commenting interests make the problem technically challenging. The problem of recommending comment-worthy articles is resolved by leveraging article and comment content through topic modeling and the co-commenting pattern of users through collaborative filtering, combined within a novel hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach. Our solution, Collaborative Correspondence Topic Models (CCTM), generates user profiles which are leveraged to provide a personalized ranking of articles for each user. Through these -driven user profiles, CCTM effectively handle the ubiquitous problem of without relying on additional meta-data. The inference problem for the model is intractable with no off-the-shelf solution and we develop an efficient Monte Carlo EM algorithm. CCTM is evaluated on three real world data-sets, crawled from two , ArsTechnica (AT) Gadgets (102,087 comments) and AT-Science (71,640 comments), and a site, DailyMail (33,500 comments). We show average improvement of 14% (warm-start) and 18% (cold-start) in AUC, and 80% (warm-start) and 250% (cold-start) in Hit-Rank@5, over state of the art.</p>

    <h3>Fast Differentially Private Matrix Factorization (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Xiang Wang, Ziqi Liu, Alexander J. Smola</p>
    <p>Differentially private collaborative filtering is a challenging task, both in terms of accuracy and speed. We present a simple algorithm that is provably differentially private, while offering good performance, using a novel connection of differential privacy to Bayesian posterior sampling via Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics. Due to its simplicity the algorithm lends itself to efficient implementation. By careful systems design and by exploiting the power law behavior of the data to maximize CPU cache bandwidth we are able to generate 1024 dimensional models at a rate of 8.5 million recommendations per second on a single PC.</p>

    <h3>Preference-oriented Social Networks: Group Recommendation and Inference (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Craig Boutilier, Amirali Salehi-Abari</p>
    <p>Social networks facilitate a variety of social, economic, and political interactions. Homophily and social influence suggest that preferences (e.g., over products, services, political parties) are likely to be correlated among people whom directly interact in a social network. We develop a model, , that captures such correlations of individual preferences, where preferences take the form of rankings over a set of options. We develop probabilistic inference methods for predicting individual preferences given observed social connections and partial observations of the preferences of others in the network. We exploit these predictions in a context to make group decisions or recommendations even when the preferences of some group members are unobserved. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms and the improvements made possible by accounting for social ties.</p>

    <h3>A Framework for Matrix Factorization based on General Distributions (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandros Nanopoulos, Josef Bauer</p>
    <p>In this paper we extend the current state-of-the-art matrix factorization method for recommendations to general probability distributions. As shown in previous work, the standard method called “Probabilistic Matrix Factorization” is based on a normal distribution assumption. While there exists work in which this method is extended to other distributions, these extensions are restrictive and we experimentally show on the basis of a real data set that it is worthwhile considering more general distributions which have not been used in the literature. Our contribution lies in providing a flexible and easy-to-use framework for matrix factorization with almost no limitation on the form of the distribution used. Our approach is based on maximum likelihood estimation and a key ingredient of our proposed method is automatic differentiation. This allows for the automatic derivation of the corresponding optimization algorithm, without the need to derive it manually for each distributional assumption while simultaneously being computationally efficient. Thus, with our method it is very easy to use a wide range of even complicated distributions for any data set.</p>

    <h3>On Over-Specialization and Concentration Biases of Recommendations: Probabilistic Neighborhood Selection in Collaborative Filtering Systems (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Tuzhilin, Panagiotis Adamopoulos</p>
    <p>Focusing on the problems of over-specialization and concentration bias, this paper presents a novel probabilistic method for recommending items in the neighborhood-based collaborative filtering framework. For the probabilistic neighborhood selection phase, we use an efficient method for weighted sampling of k neighbors that takes into consideration the similarity levels between the target user (or item) and the candidate neighbors. We conduct an empirical study showing that the proposed method increases the diversity, dispersion, and mobility of recommendations by selecting diverse sets of neighbors. We also demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms popular methods in terms of item prediction accuracy, utility-based ranking, and other measures, across various experimental settings. This performance improvement is in accordance with ensemble learning theory and the phenomenon of “hubness” in recommender systems.</p>
