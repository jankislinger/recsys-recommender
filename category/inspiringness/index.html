    <h3>Analyzing Accuracy versus Diversity in a Health Recommender System for Physical Activities: a Longitudinal User Study (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luc Martens, Toon De Pessemier, Ine Coppens</p>
    <p>As personalization has great potential to improve mobile health apps, analyzing the effect of different recommender algorithms in the health domain is still in its infancy. As such, this paper investigates whether more accurate recommendations from a content-based recommender or more diverse recommendations from a user-based collaborative filtering recommender will lead to more motivation to move. An eight-week longitudinal between-subject user study is being conducted with an Android app in which participants receive personalized recommendations for physical activities and tips to reduce sedentary behavior. The objective manipulation check confirmed that the group with collaborative filtering received significantly more diverse recommendations. The subjective manipulation check showed that the content-based group assigned more positive feedback for perceived accuracy and star rating to the recommendations they chose and executed. However, perceived diversity and inspiringness was significantly higher in the content-based group, suggesting that users might experience the recommendations differently. Lastly, momentary motivation for the executed activities and tips was significantly higher in the content-based group. As such, the preliminary results of this longitudinal study suggest that more accurate and less diverse recommendations have better effects on motivating users to move more.</p>
