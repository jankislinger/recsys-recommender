    <h3>SeCor: Aligning Semantic and Collaborative representations by Large Language Models for Next-Point-of-Interest Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling Ding, Yang Xiang, Jianting Chen, Shirui Wang, Xiaoying Gao, Bohan Xie</p>
    <p>The widespread adoption of location-based applications has created a growing demand for point-of-interest (POI) recommendation, which aims to predict a user’s next POI based on their historical check-in data and current location. However, existing methods often struggle to capture the intricate relationships within check-in data. This is largely due to their limitations in representing temporal and spatial information and underutilizing rich semantic features. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful semantic comprehension to solve them, they are limited by hallucination and the inability to incorporate global collaborative information. To address these issues, we propose a novel method SeCor, which treats POI recommendation as a multi-modal task and integrates semantic and collaborative representations to form an efficient hybrid encoding. SeCor first employs a basic collaborative filtering model to mine interaction features. These embeddings, as one modal information, are fed into LLM to align with semantic representation, leading to efficient hybrid embeddings. To mitigate the hallucination, SeCor recommends based on the hybrid embeddings rather than directly using the LLM’s output text. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that SeCor outperforms all baselines, achieving improved recommendation performance by effectively integrating collaborative and semantic information through LLMs.</p>

    <h3>Unlocking the Hidden Treasures: Enhancing Recommendations with Unlabeled Data (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Chen, Li Chen, Hongtao Song, Yuhan Zhao, Qilong Han</p>
    <p>Collaborative filtering (CF) stands as a cornerstone in recommender systems, yet effectively leveraging the vast reservoir of unlabeled data presents a persistent challenge. Current research endeavors to address the challenge of unlabeled data by extracting a subset closely approximating negative samples. Regrettably, the remaining data are overlooked, failing to fully integrate this valuable information into the construction of user preferences. To address this gap, we introduce a novel positive-neutral-negative (PNN) learning paradigm. PNN introduces a neutral class, encompassing intricate items challenging to categorize directly as positive or negative samples. By training a model based on this triple-wise partial ranking, PNN offers a promising solution to learning complex user preferences. Through theoretical analysis, we connect PNN to one-way partial AUC (OPAUC) to validate its efficacy. Implementing the PNN paradigm is, however, technically challenging because: (1) it is difficult to classify unobserved items into neutral or negative in the absence of supervisory signals; (2) there does not exist any loss function that can handle set-level triple-wise ranking relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a semi-supervised learning method coupled with a user-aware attention model for knowledge acquisition and classification refinement. Additionally, a novel loss function and two-step centroid ranking approach enable handling set-level rankings. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that, when combined with PNN, a wide range of representative CF models can consistently and significantly boost their performance. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PNN-RecBole-4E04.</p>

    <h3>MODEM: Decoupling User Behavior for Shared-Account Video Recommendations on Large Screen Devices (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiang Li, Lantao Hu, Zhen Zhang, Xiang Feng, Yongqi Liu, Muyang Li</p>
    <p>In scenarios involving sequence recommendations on large screen devices, such as tablets or TVs, the equipment is often shared among multiple users. This sharing leads to a mixture of behaviors from different users, posing significant challenges to recommendation systems, especially when clear supervisory signals for distinguishing among users are absent. Current solutions tend to either operate in an unsupervised manner or rely on constructed supervisory signals that are not entirely reliable. Moreover, the peculiarities of short video recommendations in this context have not been thoroughly explored in existing research. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces Multi-User Contrastive Decoupling Model (MODEM), a novel short video recommendation model specifically designed for large screen devices. MODEM leverages an attention mechanism, grounded in session segmentation, to disentangle the intertwined user behavior histories. It also discriminates between the impacts of long and short viewing behaviors on short video recommendations by cross-analyzing sequences of both. Furthermore, we have developed a contrastive learning method to oversee the decoupling of user behaviors effectively. Our evaluations demonstrate noticeable improvements through both offline assessments within public datasets and online A/B testing within Kuaishou’s short video recommendation environment on large screen devices. Specifically, our online A/B tests resulted in a 0.55% increase in watch time. These results underscore MODEM’s efficacy in enhancing recommendation quality in shared account contexts.</p>

    <h3>Climbing crags repetitive choices and recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iustina Ivanova</p>
    <p>Outdoor sport climbing in Northern Italy attracts climbers from around the world. While this country has many rock formations, it offers enormous possibilities for adventurous people to explore the mountains. Unfortunately, this great potential causes a problem in finding suitable destinations (crags) to visit for climbing activity. Existing recommender systems in this domain address this issue and suggest potentially interesting items to climbers utilizing a content-based approach. These systems understand users’ preferences from their past logs recorded in an electronic training diary. At the same time, some sports people have a behavioral tendency to revisit the same place for subjective reasons. It might be related to weather and seasonality (for instance, some crags are suitable for climbing in winter/summer only), the users’ preferences (when climbers like specific destinations more than others), or personal goals to be achieved in sport (when climbers plan to try some routes again). Unfortunately, current climbing crags recommendations do not adapt when users demonstrate these repetitive behavior patterns. Sequential recommender systems can capture such users’ habits since their architectures were designed to model users’ next item choice by learning from their previous decision manners. To understand to which extent these sequential recommendations can predict the following crags choices in sport climbing, we analyzed a scenario when climbers show repetitious decisions. Further, we present a data set from collected climbers’ e-logs in the Arco region (Italy) and applied several sequential recommender systems architectures for predicting climbers’ following crags’ visits from their past logs. We evaluated these recommender systems offline and compared ranking metrics with the other reported results on the different data sets. The work concludes that sequential models obtain comparably accurate results as in the other studies and have the prospect for climbers’ subsequent visit prediction and crags recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Adaptive Collaborative Filtering with Personalized Time Decay Functions for Financial Product Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baptiste Barreau, Michalis Vazirgiannis, Ashraf Ghiye, Laurent Carlier</p>
    <p>Classical recommender systems often assume that historical data are stationary and fail to account for the dynamic nature of user preferences, limiting their ability to provide reliable recommendations in time-sensitive settings. This assumption is particularly problematic in finance, where financial products exhibit continuous changes in valuations, leading to frequent shifts in client interests. These evolving interests, summarized in the past client-product interactions, see their utility fade over time with a degree that might differ from one client to another. To address this challenge, we propose a time-dependent collaborative filtering algorithm that can adaptively discount distant client-product interactions using personalized decay functions. Our approach is designed to handle the non-stationarity of financial data and produce reliable recommendations by modeling the dynamic collaborative signals between clients and products. We evaluate our method using a proprietary dataset from BNP Paribas and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art benchmarks from relevant literature. Our findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time explicitly in the model to enhance the accuracy of financial product recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Accelerating Creator Audience Building through Centralized Exploration (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilherme Dinis Junior, Olayinka S. Folorunso, Gösta Forsum, Maksym Lefarov, Lucas Maystre, Antonina Danylenko, Buket Baran, Yu Zhao</p>
    <p>On Spotify, multiple recommender systems enable personalized user experiences across a wide range of product features. These systems are owned by different teams and serve different goals, but all of these systems need to explore and learn about new content as it appears on the platform. In this work, we describe ongoing efforts at Spotify to develop an efficient solution to this problem, by centralizing content exploration and providing signals to existing, decentralized recommendation systems (a.k.a. exploitation systems). We take a creator-centric perspective, and argue that this approach can dramatically reduce the time it takes for new content to reach its full potential.</p>

    <h3>M3REC: A Meta-based Multi-scenario Multi-task Recommendation Framework (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zerong Lan, Yingyi Zhang, Xianneng Li</p>
    <p>Users in recommender systems exhibit multi-behavior in multiple business scenarios on real-world e-commerce platforms. A crucial challenge in such systems is to make recommendations for each business scenario at the same time. On top of this, multiple predictions (e.g., Click Through Rate and Conversion Rate) need to be made simultaneously in order to improve the platform revenue. Research focus on making recommendations for several business scenarios is in the field of Multi-Scenario Recommendation (MSR), and Multi-Task Recommendation (MTR) mainly attempts to solve the possible problems in collaboratively executing different recommendation tasks. However, existing researchers have paid attention to either MSR or MTR, ignoring the integration of MSR and MTR that faces the issue of conflict between scenarios and tasks. To address the above issue, we propose a Meta-based Multi-scenario Multi-task RECommendation framework (M3REC) to serve multiple tasks in multiple business scenarios by a unified model. However, integrating MSR and MTR in a proper manner is non-trivial due to: 1) Unified representation problem: Users’ and items’ representation behave Non-i.i.d in different scenarios and tasks which takes inconsistency into recommendations. 2) Synchronous optimization problem: Tasks distribution varies in different scenarios, and a unified optimization method is needed to optimize multi-tasks in multi-scenarios. Thus, to unified represent users and items, we design a Meta-Item-Embedding Generator (MIEG) and a User-Preference Transformer (UPT). The MIEG module can generate initialized item embedding using item features through meta-learning technology, and the UPT module can transfer user preferences in other scenarios. Besides, the M3REC framework uses a specifically designed backbone network together with a task-specific aggregate gate to promote all tasks to achieve the purpose of optimizing multiple tasks in multiple business scenarios within one model. Experiments on two public datasets have shown that M3REC outperforms those compared MSR and MTR state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>ADRNet: A Generalized Collaborative Filtering Framework Combining Clinical and Non-Clinical Data for Adverse Drug Reaction Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Hua Zhou, Zetong Xiong, Taojun Hu, Chunyuan Zheng, Haoxuan Li, Fuli Feng, Xiangnan He</p>
    <p>Adverse drug reaction (ADR) prediction plays a crucial role in both health care and drug discovery for reducing patient mortality and enhancing drug safety. Recently, many studies have been devoted to effectively predict the drug-ADRs incidence rates. However, these methods either did not effectively utilize non-clinical data, i.e., physical, chemical, and biological information about the drug, or did little to establish a link between content-based and pure collaborative filtering during the training phase. In this paper, we first formulate the prediction of multi-label ADRs as a drug-ADR collaborative filtering problem, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide extensive benchmark results of previous collaborative filtering methods on two large publicly available clinical datasets. Then, by exploiting the easy accessible drug characteristics from non-clinical data, we propose ADRNet, a generalized collaborative filtering framework combining clinical and non-clinical data for drug-ADR prediction. Specifically, ADRNet has a shallow collaborative filtering module and a deep drug representation module, which can exploit the high-dimensional drug descriptors to further  guide the learning of low-dimensional ADR latent embeddings, which incorporates both the benefits of collaborative filtering and representation learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on two publicly available real-world drug-ADR clinical datasets and two non-clinical datasets to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed ADRNet.</p>

    <h3>Recommending for a Multi-Sided Marketplace with Heterogeneous Contents (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian Xing Zhang, Yuyan Wang, Long Tao</p>
    <p>Many online personalization platforms today are recommending heterogeneous contents in a multi-sided marketplace consisting of consumers, merchants and other partners. For a recommender system to be successful in these contexts, it faces two main challenges. First, each side in the marketplace has different and potentially conflicting utilities. Recommending for a multi-sided marketplace therefore entails jointly optimizing multiple objectives with trade-offs. Second, the off-the-shelf recommendation algorithms are not applicable to the heterogeneous content space, where a recommendation item could be an aggregation of other recommendation items. In this work, we develop a general framework for recommender systems in a multi-sided marketplace with heterogeneous and hierarchical contents. We propose a constrained optimization framework with machine learning models for each objective as inputs, and a probabilistic structural model for users’ engagement patterns on heterogeneous contents. Our proposed structural modeling approach ensures consistent user experience across different levels of aggregation of the contents, and provides levels of transparency to the merchants and content providers. We further develop an efficient optimization solution for ranking and recommendation in large-scale online systems in real time. We implement the framework at Uber Eats, one of the largest online food delivery platforms in the world and a three-sided marketplace consisting of eaters, restaurant partners and delivery partners. Online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in ranking heterogeneous contents and optimizing for the three sides in the marketplace. Our framework has been deployed globally as the recommendation algorithm for Uber Eats’ homepage.</p>

    <p>At Peloton, we are challenged to not just surface relevant recommendations of fitness classes to our members, but also timely ones. As our fitness content library expands, we continually produce classes on certain themes which are most timely during a narrow time window. To address this challenge, we provide some control over our recommendations to external stakeholders, such as production and marketing teams. They enter timed boosts of certain classes during the windows they are relevant in. We have built out algorithms which take these desired classes and elevate the number of impressions for them, while preserving members’ engagement with our recommendations. In this paper, we discuss the system, the algorithms and some results from a few A/B tests showing how boosting works in practice.</p>

    <p>The music streaming service Deezer extensively relies on its Flow algorithm, which generates personalized radio-style playlists of songs, to help users discover musical content. Nonetheless, despite promising results over the past years, Flow used to ignore the moods of users when providing recommendations. In this paper, we present Flow Moods, an improved version of Flow that addresses this limitation. Flow Moods leverages collaborative filtering, audio content analysis, and mood annotations from professional music curators to generate personalized mood-specific playlists at scale. We detail the motivations, the development, and the deployment of this system on Deezer. Since its release in 2021, Flow Moods has been recommending music by moods to millions of users every day.</p>

    <h3>Who do you think I am? Interactive User Modelling with Item Metadata (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bart Goethals, Koen Ruymbeek, Joey De Pauw</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are used in many different applications and contexts, however their main goal can always be summarised as “connecting relevant content to interested users”. Explanations have been found to help recommender systems achieve this goal by giving users a look under the hood that helps them understand why they are recommended certain items. Furthermore, explanations can be considered to be the first step towards interacting with the system. Indeed, for a user to give feedback and guide the system towards better understanding her preferences, it helps if the user has a better idea of what the system has already learned.<br>To this end, we propose a linear collaborative filtering recommendation model that builds user profiles within the domain of item metadata. Our method is hence inherently transparent and explainable. Moreover, since recommendations are computed as a linear function of item metadata and the interpretable user profile, our method seamlessly supports interactive recommendation. In other words, users can directly tweak the weights of the learned profile for more fine-grained browsing and discovery of content based on their current interests. We demonstrate the interactive aspect of this model in an online application for discovering cultural events in Belgium.</p>

    <h3>KA-Recsys: Knowledge Appropriate Patient Focused Recommendation Technologies (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khushboo Thaker</p>
    <p>Diseases such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease demand that patients take an active role in disease management and seek health information for decision-making and self-management [ 1]. The most common methods of providing reliable information to patients include health literacy workshops and patient education materials [12 , 15 ]. However, these materials are prepared for the general patient population and not always tailored to each patient’s specific needs [ 2, 12 ]. In addition, patients seek for their information needs through search engines. Previous studies have reported that search engines don’t always support information needs of patients [11 ]. Consequently, people seek information on disease specific online health communities (OHCs) [ 9 ]. But the risk of propagating misinformation still exists because existing OHCs do not provide an infrastructure to help patients find relevant and trustworthy information [ 8, 19 ].Existing patient focused health search engines and health recommender systems can accommodate better support of patients’ information needs by providing them trustworthy resources. However, current PHRS are personalized to patients’ interests and so information provided by these layperson-oriented systems is rather general [5, 6]. In fact, previous study has shown that a patient’s personal knowledge about their disease becomes more sophisticated over the course of disease [6 , 7]. Therefore, our principal motivation is to fill this gap in current PHRS, by investigating ways to suggest individualized health information that not only adapts to patients’ current information needs but also patients’ knowledge-level across the disease trajectory. The health materials recommended at the level of patients’ knowledge will not only help them engage with materials but also help in informed decision making and self management [16]. The goal of this research is to enhance state-of-the-art PHRS by exploring the technologies in the field of recommender systems and personalized learning so that PHRS can better suggest health information relevant to patients, which is appropriate to their changing knowledge level and in-line with their dynamic information need across their disease trajectory. Thus my research proposes a recommender that accommodates both patient interest and patient knowledge by integrating a patient knowledge model. The output of this research would be a knowledge-appropriate patient focused recommender system (KA-Recsys). As a case study, KA-Recsys will be implemented for ovarian cancer (OvCa) patients and integrated into HELPeR1.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation on Live-Streaming Platforms: Dynamic Availability and Repeat Consumption (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karl Aberer, Jeremie Rappaz, Julian McAuley</p>
    <p>Live-streaming platforms broadcast user-generated video in real-time. Recommendation on these platforms shares similarities with traditional settings, such as a large volume of heterogeneous content and highly skewed interaction distributions. However, several challenges must be overcome to adapt recommendation algorithms to live-streaming platforms: first, content availability is dynamic which restricts users to choose from only a subset of items at any given time; during training and inference we must carefully handle this factor in order to properly account for such signals, where ‘non-interactions’ reflect availability as much as implicit preference. Streamers are also fundamentally different from ‘items’ in traditional settings: repeat consumption of specific channels plays a significant role, though the content itself is fundamentally ephemeral. In this work, we study recommendation in this setting of a dynamically evolving set of available items. We propose LiveRec, a self-attentive model that personalizes item ranking based on both historical interactions and current availability. We also show that carefully modelling repeat consumption plays a significant role in model performance. To validate our approach, and to inspire further research on this setting, we release a dataset containing 475M user interactions on Twitch over a 43-day period. We evaluate our approach on a recommendation task and show our method to outperform various strong baselines in ranking the currently available content.</p>
