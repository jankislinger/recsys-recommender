    <h3>Societal Sorting as a Systemic Risk of Recommenders (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carmine Ventre, Luke Thorburn, Maria Polukarov</p>
    <p>Political scientists distinguish between polarization (loosely, people moving further apart along a single dimension) and sorting (an increase in the probabilistic dependence between multiple dimensions of individual difference). Among other harms, sorting can increase the risk of conflict escalation by reinforcing us-and-them group identities and reducing the prevalence of cross-cutting affiliations. In this paper, we (i) review normative arguments for high or low sortedness, (ii) summarize the mechanisms by which sortedness can change, and (iii) show that under a simple model of social media recommender-driven preference change, personalized engagement-based ranking creates a systematic tendency towards sorting, while ranking by diverse engagement (sometimes called “bridging-based ranking”) mitigates this tendency. We conclude by considering the implications for those conducting systemic risk assessments of very large online platforms under the EU Digital Services Act.</p>

    <h3>Fairness and Transparency in Music Recommender Systems: Improvements for Artists (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karlijn Dinnissen</p>
    <p>Music streaming services have become one of the main sources of music consumption in the last decade, with recommender systems as an important component. As those systems partially decide the songs that music consumers listen to, the systems greatly impact the artists who created the songs. However, when evaluating performance and fairness of these music recommending systems (MRSs), the perspective of the item providers or other music industry professionals is often not considered. Additionally, artists indicate they would appreciate more transparency – both towards and users and the artists themselves – regarding why certain items are recommended and others are not. This research project takes a multi-stakeholder approach to bridge the gap between music systems and their item providers. We first establish artists’ and music industry professionals’ perspective on MRSs through interviews and questionnaires. Based on those insights, we then aim to increase matching between end users and lesser-known artists by generating rich item and user representations. Results will be evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. Lastly, we plan to effectively communicate MRS fairness by increasing transparency for both end users and artists.</p>

    <h3>RADio – Rank-Aware Divergence Metrics to Measure Normative Diversity in News Recommendations (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mateo Gutierrez Granada, Sanne Vrijenhoek, Maarten de Rijke, Gabriel Bénédict, Daan Odijk</p>
    <p>In traditional recommender system literature, diversity is often seen as the opposite of similarity, and typically defined as the distance between identified topics, categories or word models. However, this is not expressive of the social science’s interpretation of diversity, which accounts for a news organization’s norms and values and which we here refer to as normative diversity. We introduce RADio, a versatile metrics framework to evaluate recommendations according to these normative goals. RADio introduces a rank-aware Jensen Shannon (JS) divergence. This combination accounts for (i) a user’s decreasing propensity to observe items further down a list and (ii) full distributional shifts as opposed to point estimates. We evaluate RADio’s ability to reflect five normative concepts in news recommendations on the Microsoft News Dataset and six (neural) recommendation algorithms, with the help of our metadata enrichment pipeline. We find that RADio provides insightful estimates that can potentially be used to inform news recommender system design.</p>

    <h3>“Serving Each User”: Supporting Different Eating Goals Through a Multi-List Recommender Interface (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alain Starke, Christoph Trattner, Edis Asotic</p>
    <p>Food recommender systems optimize towards a user’s current preferences. However, appetites may vary, in the sense that users might seek healthy recipes today and look for unhealthy meals tomorrow. In this paper, we propose a novel approach in the food domain to diversify recommendations across different lists to ‘serve’ different users goals, compiled in a multi-list food recommender interface. We evaluated our interface in a 2 (single list vs multiple lists) x 2 (without or with explanations) between-subject user study (N = 366), linking choice behavior and evaluation aspects through the user experience framework. Our multi-list interface was evaluated more favorably than a single-list interface, in terms of diversity and choice satisfaction. Moreover, it triggered changes in food choices, even though these choices were less healthy than those made in the single-list interface.</p>

    <h3>Challenges Experienced in Public Service Media Recommendation Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Grün</p>
    <p>After multiple years of successfully applying recommendation algorithms at ZDF, a German Public Service Media provider, we have faced certain challenges in regards to the optimization of our systems and the resulting recommendations. The design and the optimization of our systems are guided by various, partially competing objectives and are, therefore, influenced by various factors. Similarly to commercial video on demand services, ZDF is interested in binding its audience by providing personalized recommendations in its streaming media service. However, more importantly, as a Public Service Media provider, we are committed to offer diverse, universal, unbiased, and transparent recommendations while following established editorial guidelines and strict privacy regulations. Additionally, we are committed to provide environmentally-friendly or green recommendations optimizing our systems for run time and power consumption. With the intent to start a public discussion, we describe the challenges that arise when optimizing Public Service Media recommendation systems towards machine learning metrics, business Key Performance Indicators, Public Service Media values, and run-time simultaneously, while aiming to keep the results transparent.</p>

    <h3>Learning to Recommend Diverse Items over Implicit Feedback on PANDOR (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laurent Metzger, Christophe Sebastien, Sumit Sidana, Charlotte Laclau, Massih-Reza Amini</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present a novel and publicly available dataset for online recommendation provided by Purch. The dataset records the clicks generated by users of Tom’s Hardware website over the ads they have been shown during one month; from 6th June, 2017 to 5th July, 2017. Then, besides a detailed description of the dataset, we evaluate the performance of six popular baselines and propose a simple yet effective strategy on how to overcome the existing challenges inherent to implicit feedback and popularity bias introduced while designing an efficient and scalable recommendation algorithms. More specifically, we propose to demonstrate the importance of introducing diversity based on an appropriate representation of items in Recommender Systems, when the available feedback is strongly biased.</p>
