    <h3>How Long to Stay Where? On the Amount of Item Consumption in Travel Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wolfgang Wörndl, Linus W. Dietz</p>
    <p>Recommender systems could benefit from not only recommending the most fitting items, but also in what quantity the user should consume them. For example, a personalized travel recommender system could indicate not just which city one should travel to, but also how much time to spend there. We present a data-driven solution to this problem based on mining trips from location-based social networks. To determine the recommended duration of stay at a destination, we consider how long travelers typically stay at different cities and how much time the current user generally spends visiting cities.</p>

    <h3>Data Mining for Item Recommendation in MOBA Games (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Parra, Felipe Rios, Vladimir Araujo</p>
    <p>E-Sports has been positioned as an important activity within  MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) games in recent years. There is existing research on recommender systems in this topic, but most of it focuses on the character recommendation problem. However, the recommendation of items is also challenging because of its contextual nature, depending on the other characters. We have developed a framework that suggests items for a character based on the match context. The system aims to help players who have recently started the game as well as frequent players to take strategic advantage during a match and to improve their purchasing decision making. By analyzing a dataset of ranked matches through data mining techniques, we can capture purchase dynamic of experienced players to use it to generate recommendations. The results show that our proposed solution yields up to 80% of mAP, suggesting that the method leverages context information successfully. These results, together with open issues we mention in the paper, call for further research in the area. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>ParsRec: A Meta-Learning Recommender System for Bibliographic Reference Parsing Tools (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joeran Beel, Dominika Tkaczyk</p>
    <p>Bibliographic reference parsers extract metadata (e.g. author names, title, year) from bibliographic reference strings. No reference parser consistently gives the best results in every scenario. For instance, one tool may be best in extracting titles, and another tool in extracting author names. In this paper, we address the problem of reference parsing from a recommender-systems perspective. We propose ParsRec, a meta-learning approach that recommends the potentially best parser(s) for a given reference string. We evaluate ParsRec on 105k references from chemistry. We propose two approaches to meta-learning recommendations. The first approach learns the best parser for an entire reference string. The second approach learns the best parser for each field of a reference string. The second approach achieved a 2.6% increase in F1 (0.909 vs. 0.886, p < 0.001) over the best single parser (GROBID), reducing the false positive rate by 20.2% (0.075 vs. 0.094), and the false negative rate by 18.9% (0.107 vs. 0.132).</p>

    <h3>User Churn Migration Analysis with DEDICOM (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Bauckhage, César Ojeda, Rafet Sifa</p>
    <p>Time plays an important role regarding user preferences for products. It introduces asymmetries into the adoption of products which should be considered the context of recommender systems and business intelligence. We therefore investigate how temporally asymmetric user preferences can be analyzed using a latent factor model called Decomposition Into Directional Components (DEDICOM). We introduce a new scalable hybrid algorithm that combines projected gradient descent and alternating least squares updates to compute DEDICOM and imposes semi-nonnegativity constraints to better interpret the resulting factors. We apply our model to analyze user churn and migration between different computer games in a social gaming environment.</p>

    <h3>Computer Security Training Recommender for Developers (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward Allen, Muhammad Nadeem, Byron Williams</p>
    <p>Vulnerable code may cause security breaches in software systems resulting in loss of confidential data and financial losses for the organizations. Software developers must be given proper training to write secure code. Conventional training methods do not take the code written by the developers over time into account, which makes these training sessions less effective. We propose a Computer Security Training Recommender to help identify focused and narrow areas in which developers need training. The proposed recommender system leverages the power of static analysis techniques to suggest the most appropriate training topics for different software developers; moreover it utilizes public vulnerability repositories to suggest community accepted solutions to different security problems. This paper presents an architecture of the proposed recommender system and a proof-of-concept case study. We found that vulnerabilities, flagged in source code by static analysis tools, can be mapped to relevant articles in a vulnerability repository. Hence, the mitigation strategies given in such articles may be used as a resource to train individual software developers. Preliminary empirical evaluation shows that the proposed system is promising.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation-based Modeling Support for Data Mining Processes (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Simon Fischer</p>
    <p>RapidMiner is a software tool that allows users to define data mining processes based on a visual model and implements a variety of so-called operators for data extraction, manipulation, model learning and analysis. The large number of available operators can however make it challenging for the process designer to identify the appropriate operator for the problem at hand. At the same time, some operators are only meaningful when combined with certain others. In this work, we evaluate different strategies of recommending additional operators to the user during the design of the process. The recommendation models are learned using a pool of several thousand existing data mining processes and evaluated in an offline experimental design. The results indicate that good predictive accuracy can already be achieved with comparably simple co-occurrence based algorithms.</p>
