    <h3>Integrating Matrix Factorization with Graph based Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rachana Mehta</p>
    <p>Graph based Recommender models make use of user-item rating and user-user social relationships to elicit recommendation performance by extracting inherent geometrical knowledge. In a social graph scenario, user-user trust plays a significant role in reducing sparsity and has varied characteristics that can be exploited. Existing models limit themselves to learning from either a high order interaction graph of user-item ratings or a user-user social graph from trust value. They explore other trust characteristics in a very limited setting. The graph based model, designed using entire user-user social information, impacts performance and escalates complexities in model learning. To alleviate these issues of graph learning, graph recommender seeks assistance from matrix factorization techniques. Incorporating graph based model with matrix factorization brings its own set of challenges of model integration, leveraging trust, graph learning, and optimization. This article presents the existing work in that line and future possibilities and challenges to be catered to through novel developments</p>

    <h3>Societal Sorting as a Systemic Risk of Recommenders (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carmine Ventre, Luke Thorburn, Maria Polukarov</p>
    <p>Political scientists distinguish between polarization (loosely, people moving further apart along a single dimension) and sorting (an increase in the probabilistic dependence between multiple dimensions of individual difference). Among other harms, sorting can increase the risk of conflict escalation by reinforcing us-and-them group identities and reducing the prevalence of cross-cutting affiliations. In this paper, we (i) review normative arguments for high or low sortedness, (ii) summarize the mechanisms by which sortedness can change, and (iii) show that under a simple model of social media recommender-driven preference change, personalized engagement-based ranking creates a systematic tendency towards sorting, while ranking by diverse engagement (sometimes called “bridging-based ranking”) mitigates this tendency. We conclude by considering the implications for those conducting systemic risk assessments of very large online platforms under the EU Digital Services Act.</p>

    <h3>Disentangling Motives behind Item Consumption and Social Connection for Mutually-enhanced Joint Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yew Soon Ong, Jie Zhang, Zhu Sun, Youchen Sun, Xiao Sha</p>
    <p>Item consumption and social connection, as common user behaviors in many web applications, have been extensively studied. However, most current works separately perform either item or social link prediction tasks, possibly with the help of the other as an auxiliary signal. Moreover, they merely consider the behaviors in a holistic manner yet neglect the multi-faceted motives behind them (e.g., watching movies to kill time or with friends; connecting with others due to friendships or colleagues). To fill the gap, we propose to disentangle the multi-faceted motives in each network, defined respectively by the two types of behaviors, for mutually- enhanced joint prediction (DMJP). Specifically, we first learn the disentangled user representations driven by motives of multi-facets in both networks. Thereafter, the mutual influence of the two networks is subtly discriminated at the facet-to-facet level. The fine-grained mutual influence, proven to be asymmetric, is then exploited to help refine user representations in both networks, with the goal of achieving a mutually-enhanced joint item and social link prediction. Empirical studies on three public datasets showcase the superiority of DMJP against state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on both tasks.</p>

    <h3>Information Interactions in Outcome Prediction: Quantification and Interpretation using Stochastic Block Models (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaël Poux-Médard, Sabine Loudcher, Julien Velcin</p>
    <p>In most real-world applications, it is seldom the case that a result appears independently from an environment. In social networks, users’ behavior results from the people they interact with, news in their feed, or trending topics. In natural language, the meaning of phrases emerges from the combination of words. In general medicine, a diagnosis is established on the basis of the interaction of symptoms. Here, we propose the Interacting Mixed Membership Stochastic Block Model (IMMSBM), which investigates the role of interactions between entities (hashtags, words, memes, etc.) and quantifies their importance within the aforementioned corpora. We find that in inference tasks, taking them into account leads to average relative changes with respect to non-interacting models of up to 150% in the probability of an outcome and greatly improves the predictions performances. Furthermore, their role greatly improves the predictive power of the model. Our findings suggest that neglecting interactions when modeling real-world phenomena might lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn.</p>

    <h3>Auditing the Effect of Social Network Recommendations on Polarization in Geometrical Ideological Spaces (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Philippe Cointet, Ramaciotti Morales</p>
    <p>The prevalence of algorithmic recommendations has raised public concern about undesired societal effects. A central threat is the risk of polarization, which is difficult to conceptualize and to measure, making it difficult to assess the role of Recommender Systems in this phenomenon. These difficulties have yielded two types of analyses: 1) purely topological approaches that study how recommenders isolate or connect types of nodes in a graph, and 2) spatial opinion approaches that study how recommenders change the distribution of users on a given opinion scale. The former analyses prove inadequate in settings where users are not classified into categorical types (e.g., in two-party systems with binary social divides), while the latter rely on synthetic data due to the unobservability of opinions. To overcome both difficulties we present the first analysis of friend recommendations acting on real-world sub-graphs of the Twitter network where users are embedded in multidimensional ideological spaces and in which dimensions are indicators of attitudes towards issues in the public debate. We present a polarization metric adapted to these dual topological and spatial states of social network, and use it to track both the evolution of polarization on Twitter networks where the graph evolves following well-known Recommender Systems, and opinions co-evolve following a DeGroot opinion model. We show that different recommendation principles can sometimes drive or mitigate polarization appearing in real social networks.</p>

    <h3>Explainable Recommendations via Attentive Multi-Persona Collaborative Filtering (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avi Caciularu, Oren Barkan, Noam Koenigstein, Yonatan Fuchs</p>
    <p>Two main challenges in recommender systems are modeling users with heterogeneous taste, and providing explainable recommendations. In this paper, we propose the neural Attentive Multi-Persona Collaborative Filtering (AMP-CF) model as a unified solution for both problems. AMP-CF breaks down the user to several latent ‘personas’ (profiles) that identify and discern the different tastes and inclinations of the user. Then, the revealed personas are used to generate and explain the final recommendation list for the user. AMP-CF models users as an attentive mixture of personas, enabling a dynamic user representation that changes based on the item under consideration. We demonstrate AMP-CF on five collaborative filtering datasets from the domains of movies, music, video games and social networks. As an additional contribution, we propose a novel evaluation scheme for comparing the different items in a recommendation list based on the distance from the underlying distribution of “tastes” in the user’s historical items. Experimental results show that AMP-CF is competitive with other state-of-the-art models. Finally, we provide qualitative results to showcase the ability of AMP-CF to explain its recommendations.</p>

    <h3>ImRec: Learning Reciprocal Preferences Using Images (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan McConville, James Neve</p>
    <p>Reciprocal Recommender Systems are recommender systems for social platforms that connect people to people. They are commonly used in online dating, social networks and recruitment services. The main difference between these and conventional user-item recommenders that might be found on, for example, a shopping service, is that they must consider the interests of both parties. In this study, we present a novel method of making reciprocal recommendations based on image data. Given a user’s history of positive and negative preference expressions on other users images, we train a siamese network to identify images that fit a user’s personal preferences. We provide an algorithm to interpret those individual preference indicators into a single reciprocal preference relation. Our evaluation was performed on a large real-world dataset provided by a popular online dating service. Based on this, our service significantly improves on previous state-of-the-art content-based solutions, and also out-performs collaborative filtering solutions in cold-start situations. The success of this model provides empirical evidence for the high importance of images in online dating.</p>

    <h3>Tuning Word2vec for Large Scale Recommendation Systems (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suvash Sedhain, Ben Chamberlain, Dan Shiebler, Emanuele Rossi, Michael Bronstein</p>
    <p>Word2vec is a powerful machine learning tool that emerged from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and is now applied in multiple domains, including recommender systems, forecasting, and network analysis. As Word2vec is often used off the shelf, we address the question of whether the default hyperparameters are suitable for recommender systems. The answer is emphatically no. In this paper, we first elucidate the importance of hyperparameter optimization and show that unconstrained optimization yields an average 221% improvement in hit rate over the default parameters. However, unconstrained optimization leads to hyperparameter settings that are very expensive and not feasible for large scale recommendation tasks. To this end, we demonstrate 138% average improvement in hit rate with a runtime budget-constrained hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, to make hyperparameter optimization applicable for large scale recommendation problems where the target dataset is too large to search over, we investigate generalizing hyperparameters settings from samples. We show that applying constrained hyperparameter optimization using only a 10% sample of the data still yields a 91% average improvement in hit rate over the default parameters when applied to the full datasets. Finally, we apply hyperparameters learned using our method of constrained optimization on a sample to the Who To Follow recommendation service at Twitter and are able to increase follow rates by 15%.</p>

    <h3>Tripartite Heterogeneous Graph Propagation for Large-scale Social Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donghyun Kwak, Minkyu Kim, Hanock Kwak, Jae-Han Cho, Nako Sung, Jung-Woo Ha, Kyung-Min Kim, Sangkwon Sim, Young-Jin Park, Jihun Kwon</p>
    <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been emerging as a promising method for relational representation including recommender systems. However, various challenging issues of social graphs hinder the practical usage of GNNs for social recommendation, such as their complex noisy connections and high heterogeneity. The oversmoothing of GNNs is an obstacle of GNN-based social recommendation as well. Here we propose a new graph embedding method Heterogeneous Graph Propagation (HGP) to tackle these issues. HGP uses a group-user-item tripartite graph as input to reduce the number of edges and the complexity of paths in a social graph. To solve the oversmoothing issue, HGP embeds nodes under a personalized PageRank based propagation scheme, separately for group-user graph and user-item graph. Node embeddings from each graph are integrated using an attention mechanism. We evaluate our HGP on a large-scale real-world dataset consisting of 1,645,279 nodes and 4,711,208 edges. The experimental results show that HGP outperforms several baselines in terms of AUC and F1-score metrics.</p>

    <h3>Enhancing Structural Diversity in Social Networks by Recommending Weak Ties (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Castells, Javier Sanz-Cruzado</p>
    <p>Contact recommendation has become a common functionality in online social platforms, and an established research topic in the social networks and recommender systems fields. Predicting and recommending links has been mainly addressed to date as an accuracy-targeting problem. In this paper we put forward a different perspective, considering that correctly predicted links may not be all equally valuable. Contact recommendation brings an opportunity to drive the structural evolution towards desirable properties of the network as a whole, beyond the sum of the isolated gains for the individual users to whom recommendations are delivered –global properties that we may want to assess and promote as explicit recommendation targets. In this perspective, we research the definition of relevant diversity metrics drawing from social network analysis concepts, and linking to prior diversity notions in recommender systems. In particular, we elaborate on the notion of weak tie recommendation as a means to enhance the structural diversity of networks. In order to show the signification of the proposed metrics, we report experiments with Twitter data illustrating how state of the art contact recommendation methods compare in terms of our metrics; we examine the tradeoff with accuracy, and we show that diverse link recommendations result in a corresponding diversity enhancement in the flow of information through the network, with potential implications in mitigating filter bubbles.</p>

    <h3>Trust based Collaborative Filtering: Tackling the Cold Start Problem Using Regular Equivalence (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomislav Duricic, Emanuel Lacic, Elisabeth Lex, Dominik Kowald</p>
    <p>User-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most popular approaches to create recommender systems. This approach is based on finding the most relevant k users from whose rating history we can extract items to recommend. CF, however, suffers from data sparsity and the cold-start problem since users often rate only a small fraction of available items. One solution is to incorporate additional information into the recommendation process such as explicit trust scores that are assigned by users to others or implicit trust relationships that result from social connections between users. Such relationships typically form a very sparse trust network, which can be utilized to generate recommendations for users based on people they trust. In our work, we explore the use of a measure from network science, i.e. regular equivalence, applied to a trust network to generate a similarity matrix that is used to select the k-nearest neighbors for recommending items. We evaluate our approach on Epinions and we find that we can outperform related methods for tackling cold-start users in terms of recommendation accuracy.</p>

    <h3>CLoSe: Contextualized Location Sequence Recommender (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramesh Baral, Sitharama Iyengar, Li Tao</p>
    <p>The location-based social networks (LBSN) (e.g., Facebook.com, etc.) have been explored heavily in the past decade for Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation. Many of the existing recommenders focus on recommending a single location or an arbitrary list of locations. In this paper, we propose a model termed CLoSe (Contextualized Location Sequence Recommender) that generates contextually coherent POI sequences relevant to user preferences. The POI sequence recommenders are helpful in many day-to-day activities, for e.g., itinerary planning, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to formulate contextual POI sequence recommendation by exploiting Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We incorporate check-in contexts to the hidden layer and global context to the hidden and output layers of RNN. We also demonstrate the efficiency of extended Long-short term memory (LSTM) in POI sequence generation. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) it exploits multi-context and personalized user preferences to formulate contextual POI sequence generation, (ii) it presents contextual extensions of RNN and LSTM that incorporate different contexts applicable to a POI and POI sequence generation, and (iii) it evaluates the proposed models with two real-world data sets.</p>

    <h3>Learning to Rank with Trust and Distrust in Recommender Systems (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Rafailidis, Fabio Crestani</p>
    <p>The sparsity of users’ preferences can significantly degrade the quality of recommendations in the collaborative filtering strategy. To account for the fact that the selections of social friends and foes may improve the recommendation accuracy, we propose a learning to rank model that exploits users’ trust and distrust relationships. Our learning to rank model focusses on the performance at the top of the list, with the recommended items that end-users will actually see. In our model, we try to push the relevant items of users and their friends at the top of the list, while ranking low those of their foes. Furthermore, we propose a weighting strategy to capture the correlations of users’ preferences with friends’ trust and foes’ distrust degrees in two intermediate trust- and distrust-preference user latent spaces, respectively. Our experiments on the Epinions dataset show that the proposed learning to rank model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in the presence of sparsity in users’ preferences and when a part of trust and distrust relationships is not available. Furthermore, we demonstrate the crucial role of our weighting strategy in our model, to balance well the influences of friends and foes on users’ preferences.</p>

    <h3>Fewer Flops at the Top: Accuracy, Diversity, and Regularization in Two-Class Collaborative Filtering (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bibek Paudel, Thilo Haas, Abraham Bernstein</p>
    <p>In most existing recommender systems, implicit or explicit interactions are treated as positive links and all unknown interactions are treated as negative links. The goal is to suggest new links that will be perceived as positive links. However, as signed social networks and newer content services become common, it is important to distinguish between positive and negative preferences. Even in existing applications, the cost of a negative recommendation could be high when people are looking for new jobs, friends, or places to live. In this work, we develop novel probabilistic latent factor models to recommend positive links and compare with existing methods on five different openly available datasets. Our models are able to produce better ranking lists and are effective in the task of ranking positive links at the top and negative links at the bottom. Moreover, we find that modeling signed social networks and user preferences this way has the advantage of increasing diversity of recommendations. We also investigate the effect of regularization on the quality of recommendations, a matter that has not received enough attention in the literature. We find that regularization parameter heavily affects the quality of recommendations in terms of both accuracy and diversity.</p>

    <h3>Guided Walk: A Scalable Recommendation Algorithm for Complex Heterogeneous Social Networks (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uzi Cohen, Roy Levin, Hassan Abassi</p>
    <p>Online social networks have become predominant in recent years and have grown to encompass massive scales of data. In addition to data scale, these networks can be heterogeneous and contain complex structures between different users, between social entities and various interactions between users and social entities. This is especially true in enterprise social networks where hierarchies explicitly exist between employees as well. In such networks, producing the best recommendations for each user is a very challenging problem for two main reasons. First, the complex structures in the social network need to be properly mined and exploited by the algorithm. Second, these networks contain millions or even billions of edges making the problem very difficult computationally. In this paper we present Guided Walk, a supervised graph based algorithm that learns the significance of different network links for each user and then produces entity recommendations based on this learning phase. We compare the algorithm with a set of baseline algorithms using offline evaluation techniques as well as a user survey. The offline results show that the algorithm outperforms the next best algorithm by a factor of 3.6. The user survey further confirms that the recommendation are not only relevant but also rank high in terms of personal relevance for each user. To deal with large scale social networks, the Guided Walk algorithm is formulated as a Pregel program which allows us to utilize the power of distributed parallel computing. This would allow horizontally scaling the algorithm for larger social networks by simply adding more compute nodes to the cluster.</p>

    <h3>Representation Learning for Homophilic Preferences (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hady W. Lauw, Trong T. Nguyen</p>
    <p>Users express their personal preferences through ratings, adoptions, and other consumption behaviors. We seek to learn latent representations for user preferences from such behavioral data. One representation learning model that has been shown to be effective for large preference datasets is Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). While homophily, or the tendency of friends to share their preferences at some level, is an established notion in sociology, thus far it has not yet been clearly demonstrated on RBM-based preference models. The question lies in how to appropriately incorporate social network into the architecture of RBM-based models for learning representations of preferences. In this paper, we propose two potential architectures: one that models social network among users as additional observations, and another that incorporates social network into the sharing of hidden units among related users. We study the efficacies of these proposed architectures on publicly available, real-life preference datasets with social networks, yielding useful insights.</p>
