    <h3>Learning Recommendations from User Actions in the Item-poor Insurance Domain (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Borg Bruun, Christina Lioma, Maria Maistro</p>
    <p>While personalised recommendations are successful in domains like retail, where large volumes of user feedback on items are available, the generation of automatic recommendations in data-sparse domains, like insurance purchasing, is an open problem. The insurance domain is notoriously data-sparse because the number of products is typically low (compared to retail) and they are usually purchased to last for a long time. Also, many users still prefer the telephone over the web for purchasing products, reducing the amount of web-logged user interactions. To address this, we present a recurrent neural network recommendation model that uses past user sessions as signals for learning recommendations. Learning from past user sessions allows dealing with the data scarcity of the insurance domain. Specifically, our model learns from several types of user actions that are not always associated with items, and unlike all prior session-based recommendation models, it models relationships between input sessions and a target action (purchasing insurance) that does not take place within the input sessions. Evaluation on a real-world dataset from the insurance domain (ca. 44K users, 16 items, 54K purchases, and 117K sessions) against several state-of-the-art baselines shows that our model outperforms the baselines notably. Ablation analysis shows that this is mainly due to the learning of dependencies across sessions in our model. We contribute the first ever session-based model for insurance recommendation, and make available our dataset to the research community.</p>

    <h3>From Preference into Decision Making: Modeling User Interactions in Recommender Systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gediminas Adomavicius, Qian Zhao, Martijn C. Willemsen, F. Maxwell Harper, Joseph A. Konstan</p>
    <p>User-system interaction in recommender systems involves three aspects: temporal browsing (viewing recommendation lists and/or searching/filtering), action (performing actions on recommended items, e.g., clicking, consuming) and inaction (neglecting or skipping recommended items). Modern recommenders build machine learning models from recordings of such user interaction with the system, and in doing so they commonly make certain assumptions (e.g., pairwise preference orders, independent or competitive probabilistic choices, etc.). In this paper, we set out to study the effects of these assumptions along three dimensions in eight different single models and three associated hybrid models on a user browsing data set collected from a real-world recommender system application. We further design a novel model based on recurrent neural networks and multi-task learning, inspired by Decision Field Theory, a model of human decision making. We report on precision, recall, and MAP, finding that this new model outperforms the others.</p>

    <h3>Recurrent Knowledge Graph Embedding for Effective Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Long-Kai Huang, Jie Yang, Chi Xu, Jie Zhang, Zhu Sun, Alessandro Bozzon</p>
    <p>Knowledge graphs (KGs) have proven to be effective to improve recommendation. Existing methods mainly rely on hand-engineered features from KGs, which requires domain knowledge. This paper presents RKGE, a KG embedding approach that automatically learns semantic representations of entities and paths between entities for characterizing user preferences towards items. Specifically, RKGE employs a novel recurrent network architecture that contains a batch of recurrent networks to model the semantics of paths linking a same entity pair, which are seamlessly fused into recommendation. It further employs a pooling operator to discriminate the saliency of different paths in characterizing user preferences towards items. Extensive validation shows the superiority of RKGE against the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we show that RKGE provides meaningful explanations for recommendation results.</p>

    <h3>Learning Distributed Representations from Reviews for Collaborative Filtering (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aaron Courville, Kyle Kastner, Amjad Almahairi, Kyunghyun Cho</p>
    <p>Recent work has shown that collaborative filter-based recommender systems can be improved by incorporating side information, such as natural language reviews, as a way of regularizing the derived product representations. Motivated by the success of this approach, we introduce two different models of reviews and study their effect on collaborative filtering performance. While the previous state-of-the-art approach is based on a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model of reviews, the models we explore are neural network based: a bag-of-words product-of-experts model and a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that the increased flexibility offered by the product-of-experts model allowed it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Amazon review dataset, outperforming the LDA-based approach. However, interestingly, the greater modeling power offered by the recurrent neural network appears to undermine the modelâ€™s ability to act as a regularizer of the product representations.</p>
