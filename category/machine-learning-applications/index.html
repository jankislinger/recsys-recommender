    <h3>Recommending Personalised Targeted Training Adjustments for Marathon Runners (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ciara Feely, Aonghus Lawlor, Barry Smyth, Brian Caulfield</p>
    <p>Preparing for the marathon involves many weeks of dedicated training. Achieving the right balance between building strength and endurance and the need for rest and recovery is a must, if a runner is to arrive at the start-line injury-free and ready to achieve their desired finish-time. However, because most recreational runners rely on generic training plans, they can struggle to find this balance, which can impact their motivation, health, and performance. In this paper, we describe a novel case-based reasoning approach to fine-tuning a runner’s training by recommending training adjustments based on the patterns of similar runners at corresponding points in their marathon training. The approach is designed to target training adjustments that are based on similar runners but with varying race goals,  to allow runners to adjust their training for slower or faster finish-times, as their training progresses and motivations change. We evaluate the recommendations produced using a large-scale real-world dataset according to several factors including, (i) the plausibility of the recommended training adjustment, (ii) the effectiveness of the adjustment when it comes to achieving a particular performance goal, and (iii) the safety of the adjustment in terms of the degree of risk that it will lead to an injury or otherwise disrupt training. Our findings suggest that plausible, effective, and safe recommendations can be generated for runners when evaluated against a range of race goals.</p>

    <h3>Automate Page Template Optimization: An Offline Deep Q-Learning Approach (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenyang Liu, Zhou Qin</p>
    <p>The modern e-commerce web pages have brought better customer experience and more profitable services by whole page optimization at different granularity, e.g., page layout optimization, item ranking optimization, etc. Generating the proper page layout per customer’s request is one of the vital tasks during the web page rendering process, which can directly impact customers’ shopping experience and their decision-making. In this paper, we formulate the request-rendering interactions as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it by deep reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we present the design and implementation of applying offline Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to the contextual page layout optimization problem. Through the offline evaluation method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, i.e., the RL agent has the potential to perform better than the baseline ranker by learning from the offline data set, e.g., the RL agent can improve the average cumulative rewards up to 36.69% comparing to the baseline ranker.</p>

    <h3>Recommendations and Results Organization in Netflix Search (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudarshan Lamkhede</p>
    <p>Personalized recommendations on the Netflix Homepage are based on a user’s viewing habits and the behavior of similar users. These recommendations, organized for efficient browsing, enable users to discover the next great video to watch and enjoy without additional input or an explicit expression of their intents or goals. The Netflix Search experience, on the other hand, allows users to take active control of discovering new videos by explicitly expressing their entertainment needs via search queries. In this talk, we discuss the importance of producing search results that go beyond traditional keyword-matches to effectively satisfy users’ search needs in the Netflix entertainment setting. Motivated by users’ various search intents, we highlight the necessity to improve Search by applying approaches that have historically powered the Homepage. Specifically, we discuss our approach to leverage recommendations in the context of Search and to effectively organize search results to provide a product experience that meaningfully adds value for our users.</p>

    <h3>Query as Context for Item-to-Item Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moumita Bhattacharya</p>
    <p>Recommender Systems is one of the main machine learning applications for an e-commerce platforms such as Etsy, a two sided marketplace. A frequent usage of such system is for item-to-item recommendations that show similar items (also referred as listings) based on the listing a user is currently viewing. Item-to-item recommendations typically take into account information that are only associated with the target listing and other listings in the inventory. However, other contextual information such as user intents, queries and seasonality, are often not taken into account. In this talk, we will present two approaches we developed to utilize additional contextual information in the form of queries in generating item-to-item recommendations. Moreover, we will present our journey in migrating Etsy’s rankers from linear to non-linear models. Additionally, we propose new metrics to evaluate candidate sets that accesses diversity and price spread, while not compromising relevance. The proposed metrics can also be used beyond the current application. Our proposed candidate set generation approach outperforms the model in production as well as yielding significant lift in conversion rate and other engagement metrics as indicated by several A/B tests.</p>

    <h3>Decomposing Fit Semantics for Product Size Recommendation in Metric Spaces (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian McAuley, Mengting Wan, Rishabh Misra</p>
    <p>Product size recommendation and fit prediction are critical in order to improve customers’ shopping experiences and to reduce product return rates. Modeling customers’ fit feedback is challenging due to its subtle semantics, arising from the subjective evaluation of products, and imbalanced label distribution. In this paper, we propose a new predictive framework to tackle the product fit problem, which captures the semantics behind customers’ fit feedback, and employs a metric learning technique to resolve label imbalance issues. We also contribute two public datasets collected from online clothing retailers.</p>

    <h3>Data-Driven Repricing Strategies in Competitive Markets: An Interactive Simulation Platform (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolai Jannik Podlesny, Martin Boissier, Jan Selke, Rainer Schlosser, Matthias Uflacker, Johanna Latt, Sebastian Serth, Marvin Bornstein, Jan Lindemann</p>
    <p>Modern e-commerce platforms pose both opportunities as well as hurdles for merchants. While merchants can observe markets at any point in time and automatically reprice their products, they also have to compete simultaneously with dozens of competitors. Currently, retailers lack the possibility to test, develop, and evaluate their algorithms appropriately before releasing them into the real world. At the same time, it is challenging for researchers to investigate how pricing strategies interact with each other under heavy competition. To study dynamic pricing competition on online marketplaces, we built an open simulation platform. To be both flexible and scalable, the platform has a microservice-based architecture and handles large numbers of competing merchants and arriving consumers. It allows merchants to deploy the full width of pricing strategies, from simple rule-based strategies to more sophisticated data-driven strategies using machine learning. Our platform enables analyses of how a strategy’s performance is affected by customer behavior, price adjustment frequencies, the competitors’ strategies, and the exit/entry of competitors. Moreover, our platform allows to study the long-term behavior of self-adapting strategies.</p>
