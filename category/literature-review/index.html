    <h3>Supporting Knowledge Workers through Personal Information Assistance with Context-aware Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahta Bakhshizadeh</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are extensively employed across various domains to mitigate information overload by providing personalized content. Despite their widespread use in sectors such as streaming, social networks, and e-commerce, utilizing them for personal information assistance is a comparatively novel application. This emerging application aims to develop intelligent systems capable of proactively providing knowledge workers with the most relevant information based on their context to enhance productivity. In this paper, we explore this innovative application by first defining the scope of our study, outlining the key objectives, and introducing main challenges. We then present our current results and progress, including a comprehensive literature review, the proposal of a framework, the collection of a pioneering dataset, and the establishment of a benchmark for evaluating a recommendation scenario on our published dataset. We also discuss our ongoing efforts and future research directions.</p>

    <h3>Are We Evaluating Rigorously? Benchmarking Recommendation for Reproducible Evaluation and Fair Comparison (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhu Sun, Jie Zhang, Di Yu, Xinghua Qu, Hui Fang, Jie Yang, Cong Geng</p>
    <p>With tremendous amount of recommendation algorithms proposed every year, one critical issue has attracted a considerable amount of attention: there are no effective benchmarks for evaluation, which leads to two major concerns, i.e., unreproducible evaluation and unfair comparison. This paper aims to conduct rigorous (i.e., reproducible and fair) evaluation for implicit-feedback based top-N recommendation algorithms. We first systematically review 85 recommendation papers published at eight top-tier conferences (e.g., RecSys, SIGIR) to summarize important evaluation factors, e.g., data splitting and parameter tuning strategies, etc. Through a holistic empirical study, the impacts of different factors on recommendation performance are then analyzed in-depth. Following that, we create benchmarks with standardized procedures and provide the performance of seven well-tuned state-of-the-arts across six metrics on six widely-used datasets as a reference for later study. Additionally, we release a user-friendly Python toolkit, which differs from existing ones in addressing the broad scope of rigorous evaluation for recommendation. Overall, our work sheds light on the issues in recommendation evaluation and lays the foundation for further investigation. Our code and datasets are available at GitHub (https://github.com/AmazingDD/daisyRec).</p>

    <h3>Causal Inference on Recommender Systems (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Blei, Yixin Wang, Laurent Charlin, Dawen Liang</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have become crucial in information filtering nowadays. Existing recommender systems extract user preferences based on the correlation in data, such as behavioral correlation in collaborative filtering, feature-feature, or feature-behavior correlation in click-through rate prediction. However, unfortunately, the real world is driven by causality, not just correlation, and correlation does not imply causation. For instance, recommender systems might recommend a battery charger to a user after buying a phone, where the latter can serve as the cause of the former; such a causal relation cannot be reversed. Recently, to address this, researchers in recommender systems have begun utilizing causal inference to extract causality, thereby enhancing the recommender system. In this survey, we offer a comprehensive review of the literature on causal inference-based recommendation. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts of both recommender system and causal inference as the foundation for subsequent content. We then highlight the typical issues faced by non-causality recommender system. Following that, we thoroughly review the existing work on causal inference-based recommender systems, based on a taxonomy of three-aspect challenges that causal inference can address. Finally, we discuss the open problems in this critical research area and suggest important potential future works.</p>

    <h3>HCI for Recommender Systems: the Past, the Present and the Future (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Ziefle, Andr√© Calero Valdez, Katrien Verbert</p>
    <p>How can you discover something new, that matches your interest? Recommender Systems have been studied since the 90ies. Their benefit comes from guiding a user through the density of the information jungle to useful knowledge clearings. Early research on recommender systems focuses on algorithms and their evaluation to improve recommendation accuracy using F-measures and other methodologies from signal-detection theory. Present research includes other aspects such as human factors that affect the user experience and interactive visualization techniques to support transparency of results and user control. In this paper, we analyze all publications on recommender systems from the scopus database, and particularly also papers with such an HCI focus. Based on an analysis of these papers, future topics for recommender systems research are identified, which include more advanced support for user control, adaptive interfaces, affective computing and applications in high risk domains.</p>
