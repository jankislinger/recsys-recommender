    <h3>MultiRec: A Multi-Relational Approach for Unique Item Recommendation in Auction Systems (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lars Schmidt-Thieme, Andre Hintsches, Shayan Jawed, Ahmed Rashed</p>
    <p>In auction-based systems such as in used car centers and online auction websites, users usually bid on items, and those items get sold to their highest bidders. In these settings, every item is unique and can be sold only once, which means users’ purchase histories will be unique, and no common items will exist across them. On the other hand, items will not have any historical sales at all. Such extreme settings pose a significant challenge to the current recommender systems models that rely on historical user-item interactions. While some of those models will not be applicable altogether, such as the matrix factorization models, neighborhood models, and even the naive most-popular model, the rest will need to rely only on items’ attributes. In this paper, we address the challenges of auction-based item recommendation by proposing a simple multi-relational recommender model (MultiRec) that can seamlessly leverage user and item attributes along with auxiliary relational information such as the user’s bidding history. Experiments on one proprietary dataset from Volkswagen Financial Services used-cars center, and on a real-world publicly available eBay dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms multiple state-of-art models in the task of auction-based unique item recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Quick and Accurate Attack Detection in Recommender Systems through User Attributes (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ismail Uysal, Yasin Yilmaz, Mehmet Aktukmak</p>
    <p>Malicious profiles have been a credible threat to collaborative recommender systems. Attackers provide fake item ratings to systematically manipulate the platform. Attack detection algorithms can identify and remove such users by observing rating distributions. In this study, we aim to use the user attributes as an additional information source to improve the accuracy and speed of attack detection. We propose a probabilistic factorization model which can embed mixed data type user attributes and observed ratings into a latent space to generate anomaly statistics for new users. To identify the persistent outliers in the system, we also propose a sequential attack detection algorithm to enable quick and accurate detection based on the probabilistic model learned from genuine users. The proposed model demonstrates significant improvements in both accuracy and speed when compared to baseline algorithms on a popular benchmark dataset.</p>

    <h3>MoocRec.com: Massive Open Online Courses Recommender System (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Panagiotis Symeonidis, Dimitrios Malakoudis</p>
    <p>Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have recently gained a huge users’ attention on the Web. They are considered as a highly promising form of teaching from leading universities such as Stanford and Berkeley. MoocRec.com is a web site that recommends courses to users so that, they can acquire those skills, that are expected from their ideal job posting. MoocRec’s recommendation engine is based on Matrix Factorization (MF) model combined with Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithm, which exploits information from external resources (i.e., users’ skills, courses’ characteristics, etc.) to predict course trends and to perform rating predictions according to them.</p>
