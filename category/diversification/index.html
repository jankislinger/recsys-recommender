    <h3>Deconstructing the Filter Bubble: User Decision-Making and Recommender Systems (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Duarte Goncalves, Guy Aridor, Shan Sikdar</p>
    <p>We study a model of user decision-making in the context of recommender systems via numerical simulation. Our model provides an explanation for the findings of Nguyen, et. al (2014), where, in environments where recommender systems are typically deployed, users consume increasingly similar items over time even without recommendation. We find that recommendation alleviates these natural filter-bubble effects, but that it also leads to an increase in homogeneity across users, resulting in a trade-off between homogenizing across-user consumption and diversifying within-user consumption. Finally, we discuss how our model highlights the importance of collecting data on user beliefs and their evolution over time both to design better recommendations and to further understand their impact.</p>

    <h3>DualDiv: Diversifying Items and Explanation Styles in Explainable Hybrid Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masataka Goto, Kosetsu Tsukuda</p>
    <p>In recommender systems, item diversification and explainable recommendations improve usersâ€™ satisfaction. Unlike traditional explainable recommendations that display a single explanation for each item, explainable hybrid recommendations display multiple explanations for each item and are, therefore, more beneficial for users. When multiple explanations are displayed, one problem is that similar sets of explanation styles (ESs) such as user-based, item-based, and popularity-based may be displayed for similar items. Although item diversification has been studied well, the question of how to diversify the ESs remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a method for diversifying ESs and a framework, called DualDiv, that recommends items by diversifying both the items and the ESs. Our experimental results show that DualDiv can increase the diversity of the items and the ESs without largely reducing the recommendation accuracy. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Intent-Aware Diversification Using a Constrained PLSA (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacek Wasilewski, Neil Hurley</p>
    <p>The intent-aware diversification framework was introduced initially in information retrieval and adopted to the context of recommender systems in the work of Vargas et al. The framework considers a set of aspects associated with items to be recommended. For instance, aspects may correspond to genres in movie recommendations. The framework depends on input aspect model consisting of item selection or relevance probabilities, given an aspect, and user intents, in the form of probabilities that the user is interested in each aspect. In this paper, we examine a number of input aspect models and evaluate the impact that different models have on the framework. In particular, we propose a constrained PLSA model that allows for interpretable output, in terms of known aspects, while achieving greater performance that the explicit co-occurrence counting method used in previous work. We evaluate the proposed models using a well-known MovieLens dataset for which item genres are available.</p>
