    <h3>Representing Items as Word-Embedding Vectors and Generating Recommendations by Measuring their Linear Independence (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Boratto, Roberto Saia, Gianni Fenu, Salvatore Carta</p>
    <p>In order to generate effective results, it is essential for a recommender system to model the information about the user interests in a profile. Even though word embeddings (i.e., vector representations of textual descriptions) have proven to be effective in many contexts, a content-based recommendation approach that employs them is still less effective than collaborative strategies (e.g., SVD). In order to overcome this issue, we introduce a novel criterion to evaluate the word-embedding representation of the items a user rated. The proposed approach defines a vector space in which the similarity between an unevaluated item and those in a user profile is measured in terms of linear independence. Experiments show its effectiveness to perform a better ranking of the items, w.r.t. collaborative filtering, both when compared to a latent-factor-based approach (SVD) and to a classic neighborhood user-based system.</p>

    <h3>Cross Domain Recommendation Using Vector Space Transfer Learning (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Kazama, Istvan Varga</p>
    <p>The cold start problem, frequent with recommender systems, addresses the issue in cases where we don’t know enough about our users (e.g., the user hasn’t rated anything yet, or there are no user activities) in that specific domain. In our paper we present a simple and robust transfer learning approach where we model users’ behavior in a source domain, transferring that knowledge to a new, target domain. First, we vectorize the items by using word2vec for each dataset independently. Second, we calculate the transformation matrix that connects the source dataset to the target dataset by using their common users.</p>

    <h3>Word Embedding techniques for Content-based Recommender Systems: an empirical evaluation (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Lops, Marco De Gemmis, Cataldo Musto, Giovanni Semeraro</p>
    <p>This work presents an empirical comparison among three widespread techniques as Latent Semantic Indexing, Random Indexing and the more recent Word2Vec. Specifically, we employed these techniques to learn a low-dimensional vector space and we exploited it to represent both items and user profiles in a recommendation scenario. The performance of the techniques has been evaluated against two state-of-the-art datasets, and experimental results provided good insights which pave the way to several future directions.</p>
