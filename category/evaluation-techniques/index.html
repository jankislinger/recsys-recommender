    <h3>Pareto Front Approximation for Multi-Objective Session-Based Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timo Wilm, Philipp Normann, Felix Stepprath</p>
    <p>This work introduces MultiTRON, an approach that adapts Pareto front approximation techniques to multi-objective session-based recommender systems using a transformer neural network. Our approach optimizes trade-offs between key metrics such as click-through and conversion rates by training on sampled preference vectors. A significant advantage is that after training, a single model can access the entire Pareto front, allowing it to be tailored to meet the specific requirements of different stakeholders by adjusting an additional input vector that weights the objectives. We validate the model’s performance through extensive offline and online evaluation. For broader application and research, the source code is made available. The results confirm the model’s ability to manage multiple recommendation objectives effectively, offering a flexible tool for diverse business needs.</p>

    <h3>On Target Item Sampling in Offline Recommender System Evaluation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Castells, Rocío Cañamares</p>
    <p>Target selection is a basic yet often implicit decision in the configuration of offline recommendation experiments. In this paper we research the impact of target sampling on the outcome of comparative recommender system evaluation. Specifically, we undertake a detailed analysis considering the informativeness and consistency of experiments across the target size axis. We find that comparative evaluation using reduced target sets contradicts in many cases the corresponding outcome using large targets, and we provide a principled explanation for these disagreements. We further seek to determine which among the contradicting results may be more reliable. Through comparison to unbiased evaluation, we find that minimum target sets incur in substantial distortion in pairwise system comparisons, while maximum sets may not be ideal either, and better options may lie in between the extremes. We further find means for informing the target size setting in the common case where unbiased evaluation is not possible, by an assessment of the discriminative power of evaluation, that remarkably aligns with the agreement with unbiased evaluation.</p>

    <h3>ExpLOD: A Framework for Explaining Recommendations based on the Linked Open Data Cloud (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fedelucio Narducci, Pasquale Lops, Marco De Gemmis, Giovanni Semeraro, Cataldo Musto</p>
    <p>In this paper we present ExpLOD, a framework which exploits the information available in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud to generate a natural language explanation of the suggestions produced by a recommendation algorithm. The methodology is based on building a graph in which the items liked by a user are connected to the items recommended through the properties available in the LOD cloud. Next, given this graph, we implemented some techniques to rank those properties and we used the most relevant ones to feed a module for generating explanations in natural language. In the experimental evaluation we performed a user study with 308 subjects aiming to investigate to what extent our explanation framework can lead to more transparent, trustful and engaging recommendations. The preliminary results provided us with encouraging findings, since our algorithm performed better than both a non-personalized explanation baseline and a popularity-based one.</p>
