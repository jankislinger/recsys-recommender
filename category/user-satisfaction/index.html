    <h3>Evaluation and simplification of text difficulty using LLMs in the context of recommending texts in French to facilitate language learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michalis Vlachos, Yash Raj Shrestha, Henri Jamet, Maxime Manderlier</p>
    <p>We develop a recommendation system for foreign language learning. This recommends text or video content. It ranks digital content considering both the content’s difficulty and how the topic aligns to the learners’ interests. To achieve this, we automatically apply the following operations to any text: a. Classify its subject. b. Evaluate its linguistic difficulty. c. Potentially simplify its language level, while preserving its semantic content for adaptation to the reader’s language level. Once these three operations have produced a set of texts adapted to the reader’s interests and level, they are ranked by relevance using a recommendation system based on the reading and satisfaction of other users. In this paper, we focus on using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically perform these tasks on any set of texts. We present an approach for training and evaluation and compare both zero-shot and fine-tuned performance of state-of-the-art models. Our findings indicate a marked improvement in the prediction of French content difficulty (improvement range of 18-56%), a 27% enhancement in topic prediction accuracy with fine-tuned models compared to zero-shot models, and up to an 18% increase in NDCG in recommendation performance.</p>

    <h3>Positive-Sum Impact of Multistakeholder Recommender Systems for Urban Tourism Promotion and User Utility (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Ricci, Pavel Merinov</p>
    <p>We explore how multistakeholder recommender systems (MRSs) can impact urban tourism promotion. Usually, two conflicting goals are of interest: (i) to cut down the number of visitors at popular sites and (ii) to satisfy individual tourist preferences, often biased towards popular sites. By leveraging users’ limited knowledge of the sites catalogue, we model and simulate interactions between tourists and an MRS that jointly optimises user utility and promotes less popular sites. Experiments based on data logs collected in tourist cities reveal that an MRS can lift user utility and at the same time reduce the number of visitors at popular sites, manifesting the so-called positive-sum impact. However, a delicate balance is crucial; under- or over-promotion of unpopular sites in recommendation lists can be adverse to both destination and user utilities.</p>

    <h3>Leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search for Group Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Andres Diaz-Pace, Antonela Tommasel</p>
    <p>Group recommenders aim to provide recommendations that satisfy the collective preferences of multiple users, a challenging task due to the diverse individual tastes and conflicting interests to be balanced. This is often accomplished by using aggregation techniques that select items on which the group can agree. Traditional aggregators struggle with these complexities, as items are chosen independently, leading to sub-optimal recommendations lacking diversity, novelty, or fairness. In this paper, we propose an aggregation technique that leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance group recommendations. MCTS is used to explore and evaluate candidate recommendation sequences to optimize overall group satisfaction. We also investigate the integration of MCTS with LLMs aiming at better understanding interactions between user preferences and recommendation sequences to inform the search. Experimental evaluations, although preliminary, showed that our proposal outperforms existing aggregation techniques in terms of relevance and beyond-accuracy aspects of recommendations. The LLM integration achieved positive results for recommendations’ relevance. Overall, this work highlights the potential of heuristic search techniques to tackle the complexities of group recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Explore versus repeat: insights from an online supermarket (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariagiorgia Agnese Tandoi, Daniela Solis Morales</p>
    <p>At online supermarket Picnic, we implemented both traditional collaborative filtering and a hybrid method to provide recipe recommendations at scale. This case study presents findings from the online evaluation of these algorithms, focusing on the repeat-explore trade-off. Our findings allow other online retailers to gain insights into the importance of thoughtful model design in navigating this important balance. We argue that even when exploiting known preferences proves highly beneficial in the short term, prioritizing exploratory content is essential for long-term customer satisfaction and sustained growth. Our research lays the groundwork for a compelling discussion on defining success in balancing the familiar and the novel in online grocery shopping.</p>

    <h3>Looks Can Be Deceiving: Linking User-Item Interactions and User’s Propensity Towards Multi-Objective Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Boratto, Patrik Dokoupil, Ladislav Peska</p>
    <p>Multi-objective recommender systems (MORS) provide suggestions to users according to multiple (and possibly conflicting) goals. When a system optimizes its results at the individual-user level, it tailors them on a user’s propensity towards the different objectives. Hence, the capability to understand users’ fine-grained needs towards each goal is crucial. In this paper, we present the results of a user study in which we monitored the way users interacted with recommended items, as well as their self-proclaimed propensities towards relevance, novelty and diversity objectives. The study was divided into several sessions, where users evaluated recommendation lists originating from a relevance-only single-objective baseline as well as MORS. We show that despite MORS-based recommendations attracted less selections, its presence in the early sessions is crucial for users’ satisfaction in the later stages. Surprisingly, the self-proclaimed willingness of users to interact with novel and diverse items is not always reflected in the recommendations they accept. Post-study questionnaires provide insights on how to deal with this matter, suggesting that MORS-based results should be accompanied by elements that allow users to understand the recommendations, so as to facilitate their acceptance.</p>

    <h3>An Industrial Framework for Personalized Serendipitous Recommendation in E-commerce (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sulong Xu, Anyu Dai, Zhuoye Ding, Linfang Hou, Mian Ma, Luobao Zou, Yanyan Zou, Zongyi Wang, Nan Qiao</p>
    <p>Classical recommendation methods typically face the filter bubble problem where users likely receive recommendations of their familiar items, making them bored and dissatisfied. To alleviate such an issue, this applied paper introduces a novel framework for personalized serendipitous recommendation in an e-commerce platform (i.e., JD.com), which allows to present user unexpected and satisfying items deviating from user’s prior behaviors, considering both accuracy and novelty. To achieve such a goal, it is crucial yet challenging to recognize when a user is willing to receive serendipitous items and how many novel items are expected. To address above two challenges, a two-stage framework is designed. Firstly, a DNN-based scorer is deployed to quantify the novelty degree of a product category based on user behavior history. Then, we resort to a potential outcome framework to decide the optimal timing to recommend a user serendipitous items and the novelty degree of the recommendation. Online A/B test on the e-commerce recommender platform in JD.com demonstrates that our model achieves significant gains on various metrics, 0.54% relative increase of impressive depth, 0.8% of average user click count, 3.23%  and 1.38% of number of novel impressive and clicked items individually.</p>

    <h3>Pursuing Optimal Trade-Off Solutions in Multi-Objective Recommender Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Paparella</p>
    <p>Traditional research in Recommender Systems (RSs) often solely focuses on accuracy and a limited number of beyond-accuracy dimensions. Nonetheless, real-world RSs need to consider several other aspects, such as customer satisfaction or stakeholders’ interests. Consequently, the evaluation criteria must comprehend other dimensions, like click rate, or revenue, to cite a few of them. However, what objective should the system optimize, and what objective should it sacrifice? An emerging approach to tackle the problem and aim to blend different (sometimes conflicting) objectives is Multi-Objective Recommender Systems (MORSs). This proposal sketches a strategy to exploit the Pareto optimality to introduce a new optimal solution selection approach and investigate how existing RSs perform with multi-objective tasks. The goals are twofold: (i) discovering how to rank the solutions lying on the Pareto frontier to find the best trade-off solution and (ii) comparing the Pareto frontiers of different recommendation approaches to assess whether one performs better for the considered objectives. These measures could lead to a new class of MORSs that train an RS on multiple objectives to reach the best trade-off solution directly.</p>

    <h3>Designing and evaluating explainable AI for non-AI experts: challenges and opportunities (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katrien Verbert, Vero Vanden Abeele, Maxwell Szymanski</p>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a steady increase in use in the health and medical field, where it is used by lay users and health experts alike. However, these AI systems often lack transparency regarding the inputs and decision making process (often called black boxes), which in turn can be detrimental to the user’s satisfaction and trust towards these systems. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to overcome this problem by opening up certain aspects of the black box, and has proven to be a successful means of increasing trust, transparency and even system effectiveness. However, for certain groups (i.e. lay users in health), explanation methods and evaluation metrics still remain underexplored. In this paper, we will outline our research regarding designing and evaluating explanations for health recommendations for lay users and domain experts, as well as list a few takeaways we were already able to find in our initial studies.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Negative Preference in Content-based Music Recommendation with Contrastive Learning (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minju Park, Kyogu Lee</p>
    <p>Advanced music recommendation systems are being introduced along with the development of machine learning. However, it is essential to design a music recommendation system that can increase user satisfaction by understanding users’ music tastes, not by the complexity of models. Although several studies related to music recommendation systems exploiting negative preferences have shown performance improvements, there was a lack of explanation on how they led to better recommendations. In this work, we analyze the role of negative preference in users’ music tastes by comparing music recommendation models with contrastive learning exploiting preference (CLEP) but with three different training strategies - exploiting preferences of both positive and negative (CLEP-PN), positive only (CLEP-P), and negative only (CLEP-N). We evaluate the effectiveness of the negative preference by validating each system with a small amount of personalized data obtained via survey and further illuminate the possibility of exploiting negative preference in music recommendations. Our experimental results show that CLEP-N outperforms the other two in accuracy and false positive rate. Furthermore, the proposed training strategies produced a consistent tendency regardless of different types of front-end musical feature extractors, proving the stability of the proposed method.</p>

    <h3>Solving Diversity-Aware Maximum Inner Product Search Efficiently and Effectively (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumio Fujita, Kohei Hirata, Daichi Amagata, Takahiro Hara</p>
    <p>Maximum inner product search (or k-MIPS) is a fundamental operation in recommender systems that infer preferable items for users. To support large-scale recommender systems, existing studies designed scalable k-MIPS algorithms. However, these studies do not consider diversity, although recommending diverse items is important to improve user satisfaction. We therefore formulate a new problem, namely diversity-aware k-MIPS. In this problem, users can control the degree of diversity in their recommendation lists through a parameter. However, exactly solving this problem is unfortunately NP-hard, so it is challenging to devise an efficient, effective, and practical algorithm for the diversity-aware k-MIPS problem. This paper overcomes this challenge and proposes IP-Greedy, which incorporates new early termination and skipping techniques into a greedy algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets, and the results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm. Also, we conduct a case study of the diversity-aware k-MIPS problem on a real dataset. We confirm that this problem can make recommendation lists diverse while preserving high inner products of user and item vectors in the lists.</p>

    <h3>Matching Theory-based Recommendation in Online Dating (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riku Togashi, Yoji Tomita, Daisuke Moriwaki</p>
    <p>Online dating platforms provide people with the opportunity to find a partner. Recommender systems in online dating platforms suggest one side of users to the other side of users. This reciprocal recommendation problem arises in online dating [26 , 31 ], job recommendation [2] and peer learning process [27]. Reciprocal recommender systems (RRSs) must take into account two aspects which do not arise in standard recommender systems. One aspect is the mutual interests of users. Even if one user has a strong interest in a particular user, she/he may have no interest in him/her at all. Thus, RRSs should be based on the interests of both sides of users. The other important aspect is capacities of the users; it is impossible for a user to keep up with all the candidates. Popular users are often recommended very frequently. As a result, a few super stars receive a large proportion of likes, overwhelming the time that they can spend for screening. RRSs should be designed to alleviate such problems to increase user satisfaction. The two-sided matching problem is to “match” one side of people and the other side in a situation where each person has a different preference and a matching capacity. This field is called matching theory, and various algorithms have been developed since [ 11 , 29 ]. Matching theory is applied in the analyses of marriage markets [4, 8], school choice [1] and job matching for physicians [28]. In this talk, we discuss the potential interactions between RRSs and matching theory. We also present our ongoing project to deploy a matching theory-based recommender system (MTRS) in a real-world online dating platform. This talk covers other important directions regarding RRSs, including scalability, algorithmic fairness, bandit algorithm, and online experimentation.</p>

    <h3>Argument-based generation and explanation of recommendations (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrés Segura-Tinoco</p>
    <p>In the recommender systems literature, it has been shown that, in addition to improving system effectiveness, explaining recommendations may increase user satisfaction, trust, persuasion and loyalty. In general, explanations focus on the filtering algorithms or the users and items involved in the generation of recommendations. However, on certain domains that are rich on user-generated textual content, it would be valuable to provide justifications of recommendations according to arguments that are explicit, underlying or related with the data used by the systems, e.g., the reasons for customers’ opinions in reviews of e-commerce sites, and the requests and claims in citizens’ proposals and debates of e-participation platforms. In this context, there is a need and challenging task to automatically extract and exploit the arguments given for and against evaluated items. We thus advocate to focus not only on user preferences and item features, but also on associated arguments. In other words, we propose to not only consider what is said about items, but also why it is said. Hence, arguments would not only be part of the recommendation explanations, but could also be used by the recommendation algorithms themselves. To this end, in this thesis, we propose to use argument mining techniques and tools that allow retrieving and relating argumentative information from textual content, and investigate recommendation methods that exploit that information before, during and after their filtering processes.</p>

    <p>In this paper, we provide insights into users’ needs regarding the inclusion of explanations in a movie recommender system. We have developed different variants of a movie recommender system prototype corresponding to different types of explanations and conducted an online user study to evaluate related explanations. The experimental results show that users do not always appreciate explanations. They want to see explanations when they are not satisfied with the recommended items. They expect to see explanations showing how well the recommended item meets their preferences. Moreover, explanation goals are interdependent and affect the overall satisfaction of users with the recommender system.</p>

    <p>Everyday digital tasks can highly benefit from systems that recommend the right information to use at the right time. However, existing solutions typically support only specific applications and tasks. In this demo, we showcase EntityBot, a system that captures context across application boundaries and recommends information entities related to the current task. The user’s digital activity is continuously monitored by capturing all content on the computer screen using optical character recognition. This includes all applications and services being used and specific to individuals’ computer usages such as instant messaging, emailing, web browsing, and word processing. A linear model is then applied to detect the user’s task context to retrieve entities such as applications, documents, contact information, and several keywords determining the task. The system has been evaluated with real-world tasks, demonstrating that the recommendation had an impact on the tasks and led to high user satisfaction.</p>

    <h3>Investigating the Impact of Audio States in Music Streaming Sessions (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Mehrotra, Aaron Ng</p>
    <p>Music streaming is inherently sequential in nature, with track sequence information playing a key role in user satisfaction with recommended music. In this work, we investigate the role audio characteristics of music content play in understanding music streaming sessions. Focusing on 18 audio attributes (e.g. dancability, acousticness, energy), we formulate audio transitioning in a session as a multiple changepoint detection problem, and extract latent states of different audio attributes within each session. Based on insights from large scale music streaming data from a popular music streaming platform, we investigate questions around the extent to which audio characteristics fluctuate within streaming sessions, the heterogeneity across different audio attributes and their impact on user satisfaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate the promise of such audio-based characterizing of sessions in better sequencing tracks in a session, and highlight the potential gains in user satisfaction on offer. We discuss implications on the design of track sequencing models, and identify important prediction tasks to further research on the topic.</p>

    <h3>PURS: Personalized Unexpected Recommender System for Improving User Satisfaction (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan Li, Maofei Que, Alexander Tuzhilin, Zhichao Jiang, Yao Hu</p>
    <p>Classical recommender system methods typically face the filter bubble problem when users only receive recommendations of their familiar items, making them bored and dissatisfied. To address the filter bubble problem, unexpected recommendations have been proposed to recommend items significantly deviating from user’s prior expectations and thus surprising them by presenting ”fresh” and previously unexplored items to the users. In this paper, we describe a novel Personalized Unexpected Recommender System (PURS) model that incorporates unexpectedness into the recommendation process by providing multi-cluster modeling of user interests in the latent space and personalized unexpectedness via the self-attention mechanism and via selection of an appropriate unexpected activation function. Extensive offline experiments on three real-world datasets illustrate that the proposed PURS model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline approaches in terms of both accuracy and unexpectedness measures.
