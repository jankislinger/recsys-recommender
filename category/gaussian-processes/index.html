    <h3>Kernelized Probabilistic Matrix Factorization for Collaborative Filtering: Exploiting Projected User and Item Graph (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bithika Pal, Mamata Jenamani</p>
    <p>Matrix Factorization (MF) techniques have already shown its strong foundation in collaborative filtering (CF), particularly for rating prediction problem. MF models mainly work as low-rank matrix completion problem by mapping the users and items into same low dimensional latent space. In this direction, now-a-days, a majority of the studies have focused on using additional information such as social network, item tags along with rating to mitigate different issues in the basic recommendation. This results in making the model more complex with a very specific target. However, there are very few studies in recent years which use only users rating information for the recommendation. In this paper, we present a new finding on exploiting Projected User and Item Graph in the setting of Kernelized Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (KPMF), which uses different graph kernel from the projected graphs. KPMF, here, works with its latent vector spanning over all users (and items) with Gaussian process priors and tries to capture the covariance structure across users and items from the projected graphs. We also explore the ways of building these projected graphs maintaining some properties to maximize the prediction accuracy. We implement the model in four real-world datasets and compare the results with state-of-the-art MF techniques. Using projected graph in KPMF, we achieve significant improvement in RMSE using only rating information of users.</p>

    <h3>Explore-Exploit in Top-N Recommender Systems via Gaussian Processes (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Krause, Isidor Nikolic, Hastagiri Prakash Vanchinathan, Fabio De Bona</p>
    <p>We address the challenge of ranking recommendation lists based on click feedback by efficiently encoding similarities among users and among items. The key challenges are threefold: (1) combinatorial number of lists; (2) sparse feedback and (3) context dependent recommendations. We propose the CGPRANK algorithm, which exploits prior information specified in terms of a Gaussian process kernel function, which allows to share feedback in three ways: Between positions in a list, between items, and between contexts. Under our model, we provide strong performance guarantees and empirically evaluate our algorithm on data from two large scale recommendation tasks: Yahoo! news article recommendation, and Google books. In our experiments, our CGPRANK approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-armed bandit and learning-to-rank methods, with an 18% increase in clicks.</p>
