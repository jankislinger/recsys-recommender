    <h3>Stalactite: toolbox for fast prototyping of vertical federated learning systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Khodorchenko, Anastasiia Zakharova, Dmitriy Alexandrov, Alexey Vasilev, Maxim Savchenko, Nikolay Butakov, Alexander Grigorievskiy</p>
    <p>Machine learning (ML) models trained on datasets owned by different organizations and physically located in remote databases offer benefits in many real-world use cases. State regulations or business requirements often prevent data transfer to a central location, making it difficult to utilize standard machine learning algorithms. Federated Learning (FL) is a technique that enables models to learn from distributed datasets without revealing the original data. Vertical Federated learning (VFL) is a type of FL where data samples are divided by features across several data owners. For instance, in a recommendation task, a user can interact with various sets of items, and the logs of these interactions are stored by different organizations. In this demo paper, we present Stalactite – an open-source framework for VFL that provides the necessary functionality for building prototypes of VFL systems. It has several advantages over the existing frameworks. In particular, it allows researchers to focus on the algorithmic side rather than engineering and to easily deploy learning in a distributed environment. It implements several VFL algorithms and has a built-in homomorphic encryption layer. We demonstrate its use on a real-world recommendation datasets.</p>

    <h3>A Federated Recommender System for Online Services (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Tan, Qiang Yang, Vincent Zheng, Bo Liu</p>
    <p>Due to privacy and security constraints, directly sharing user data between parties is undesired. Such decentralized data silo issues commonly exist in recommender systems. In general, recommender systems are data-driven. The more data it uses, the better performance it obtains. The data silo issues is a severe limitation of the recommender’s performance. Federated learning is an emerging technology, which bridges the data silos and builds machine learning models without compromising user privacy and data security. We design a recommender system based on federated learning. It is known as the federated recommender system. The system implements plenty of popular algorithms to support various online recommendation services. The algorithm implementation is open-sourced. We also deploy the system on a real-world content recommendation application, achieving significant performance improvement. In this demonstration, we present the architecture of the federated recommender system and give an online demo to show its detailed working procedures and results in content recommendations.</p>

    <h3>rrecsys: an R-package for prototyping recommendation algorithms (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Zanker, Ludovik Çoba</p>
    <p>We introduce rrecsys, an open source extension package in R for rapid prototyping and intuitive assessment of recommender system algorithms. As the only currently available R package for recommender algorithms (recommenderlab) did not include popular algorithm implementations such as matrix factorization or One-class Collaborative Filtering algorithms we developed rrecsys as an easily accessible tool that can, for instance, be employed for interactive demonstrations when teaching. This package replicates state-of-the-art Collaborative Filtering algorithms for rating and binary data and we compare results with the Java-based LensKit implementation and recommederlab for the purpose of benchmarking the implementation. Therefore this work can also be seen as a contribution in the context of replication of algorithm implementations and reproduction of evaluation results.</p>
