    <h3>Fair Augmentation for Graph Collaborative Filtering (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianni Fenu, Ludovico Boratto, Giacomo Medda, Mirko Marras, Francesco Fabbri</p>
    <p>Recent developments in recommendation have harnessed the collaborative power of graph neural networks (GNNs) in learning users’ preferences from user-item networks. Despite emerging regulations addressing fairness of automated systems, unfairness issues in graph collaborative filtering remain underexplored, especially from the consumer’s perspective. While the recommendation literature has seen numerous contributions in the form of mitigation algorithms and comprehensive evaluation studies on consumer unfairness, only a few of these works have delved into GNNs. A notable gap exists in the formalization of the latest mitigation algorithms, as well as in their effectiveness and reliability on cutting-edge models. In this paper, we conduct an extensive analysis of one of the latest mitigation methods tailored for consumer fairness in GNN-based recommendation. The reproduced technique adjusts the system fairness level by learning a fair graph augmentation. Our study serves as a solid response to recent research highlighting unfairness issues in graph collaborative filtering. Under an experimental setup based on 11 GNNs, 5 non-GNN models, and 5 real-world networks across diverse domains, our investigation reveals that fair graph augmentation is consistently effective on high-utility models and large datasets. Experiments on the transferability of the fair augmented graph open new issues for future recommendation~studies.</p>

    <h3>Multiple Connectivity Views for Session-based Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Miao, Yujing Wang, Yaming Yang, Jieyu Zhang, Yunhai Tong</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendation (SBR), which makes the next-item recommendation based on previous anonymous actions, has drawn increasing attention. The last decade has seen multiple deep learning-based modeling choices applied on SBR successfully, e.g., recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and each modeling choice has its intrinsic superiority and limitation. We argue that these modeling choices differentiate from each other by (1) the way they capture the interactions between items within a session and (2) the operators they adopt for composing the neural network, e.g., convolutional operator or self-attention operator. In this work, we dive deep into the former as it is relatively unique to the SBR scenario, while the latter is shared by general neural network modeling techniques. We first introduce the concept of connectivity view to describe the different item interaction patterns at the input level. Then, we develop the Multiple Connectivity Views for Session-based Recommendation (MCV-SBR), a unified framework that incorporates different modeling choices in a single model through the lens of connectivity view. In addition, MCV-SBR allows us to effectively and efficiently explore the search space of the combinations of connectivity views by the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator Approach (TPE) algorithm. Finally, on three widely used SBR datasets, we verify the superiority of MCV-SBR by comparing the searched models with state-of-the-art baselines. We also conduct a series of studies to demonstrate the efficacy and practicability of the proposed connectivity view search algorithm, as well as other components in MCV-SBR.</p>

    <h3>Do Users Matter? The Contribution of User-Driven Feature Weights to Open Dataset Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anusuriya Devaraju, Shlomo Berkovsky</p>
    <p>The vast volumes of open data pose a challenge for users in finding relevant datasets. To address this, we developed a hybrid dataset recommendation model that combines content-based similarity with item-to-item co-occurrence. The features used by the recommender include dataset properties and usage statistics. In this paper, we focus on fi ne-tuning the weights of these features. We experimentally compare two feature weighting approaches: a uniform one with predefined weights and a user-driven one, where the weights are informed by the opinions of system users. We evaluated the two approaches in a study, involving the users of a real-life data portal. The results suggest that user-driven feature weights can improve dataset recommendations, although not at all levels of data relevance, and highlight the importance of incorporating target users in the design of recommender systems.</p>
