    <h3>Bridging Viewpoints in News with Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia Hua Jeng</p>
    <p>News Recommender systems (NRSs) aid in decision-making in news media. However, undesired effects can emerge. Among these are selective exposures that may contribute to polarization, potentially reinforcing existing attitudes through belief perseverance—discounting contrary evidence due to their opposing attitudinal strength. This can be unsafe for people, making it difficult to accept information objectively. A crucial issue in news recommender system research is how to mitigate these undesired effects by designing recommender interfaces and machine learning models that enable people to consider to be more open to different perspectives. Alongside accurate models, the user experience is an equally important measure. Indeed, the core statistics are based on users’ behaviors and experiences in this research project. Therefore, this research agenda aims to steer the choices of readers’ based on altering their attitudes. The core methods plan to concentrate on the interface design and ML model building involving manipulations of cues, users’ behaviors prediction, NRSs algorithm and changing the nudges. In sum, the project aims to provide insight in the extent to which news recommender systems can be effective in mitigating polarized opinions.</p>

    <h3>Interface Design to Mitigate Inflation in Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rana Shahout, Nikhil Garg, Sasha Stoikov, Yehonatan Peisakhovsky</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems rely on user-provided data to learn about item quality and provide personalized recommendations. An implicit assumption when aggregating ratings into item quality is that ratings are strong indicators of item quality. In this work, we analyze this assumption using data collected from a music discovery application. Our study focuses on two factors that cause rating inflation: heterogeneous user rating behavior and the dynamics of personalized recommendations. We show that user rating behavior is significantly variable, leading to item quality estimates that reflect the users who rated an item more than the item quality itself. Additionally, items that are more likely to be shown via personalized recommendations can experience a substantial increase in their exposure and potential bias toward them. To mitigate these effects, we conducted a randomized controlled trial where the rating interface was modified. This resulted in a substantial improvement in user rating behavior and a reduction in item quality inflation. These findings highlight the importance of carefully considering the assumptions underlying recommendation systems and designing interfaces that encourage accurate rating behavior.</p>

    <h3>Exploring the longitudinal effect of nudging on users’ genre exploration behavior and listening preference (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martijn C. Willemsen, Yu Liang</p>
    <p>Previous studies on exploration have shown that users can be nudged to explore further away from their current preferences. However, these effects were shown in a single session study, while it often takes time to explore new tastes and develop new preferences. In this work, we present a longitudinal study on users’ exploration behavior and behavior change over time after they have used a music genre exploration tool for four sessions in six weeks. We test two relevant nudges to help them explore more: the starting point (the personalization of the default initial playlist) and the visualization of users’ previous position(s). Our results show that the personalization level of the default initial playlist in the first session influences the preferred personalization level users set in the second session but fades away in later sessions as users start exploring in different directions. Visualization of users’ previous positions did not anchor users to stay closer to the initial defaults. Over time, users perceived the playlist to be more personalized to their tastes and helpful to explore the genre. Perceived helpfulness increased more when users explored further away from their current preferences. Apart from differences in self-reported measures, we also find some objective evidence for preference change in users’ top tracks from their Spotify profile, that over the period of 6 weeks moved somewhat closer to the genre that users selected to explore with the tool.</p>

    <h3>Understanding User Interactions with Podcast Recommendations Delivered Via Voice (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longqi Yang, Christina Tsangouri, Deborah Estrin, Michael Sobolev</p>
    <p>Voice interfaces introduced by smart speakers present new opportunities and challenges for podcast content recommendations. Understanding how users interact with voice-based recommendations has the potential to inform better design of vocal recommenders. However, existing knowledge about user behavior is mostly for visual interfaces, such as the web, and is not directly transferable to voice interfaces, which rely on user listening and do not support skimming and browsing. To fill in the gap, in this paper, we conduct a controlled study to compare user interactions with recommendations delivered visually and vocally. Through an online A-B testing with 100 participants, we find that, when recommendations are vocally conveyed, users consume more slowly, explore less, and choose fewer long-tail items. The study also reveals the correlation between user choices and exploration via the voice interface. Our findings provide challenges to the design of voice interfaces, such as increasing the diversity of the top-ranked recommendations and designing better navigation mechanisms.</p>

    <h3>Improving the User Experience during Cold Start through Choice-Based Preference Elicitation (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark P. Graus, Martijn C. Willemsen</p>
    <p>We studied an alternative choice-based interface for preference elicitation during the cold start phase and compared it directly with a standard rating-based interface. In this alternative interface users started from a diverse set covering all movies and iteratively narrowed down through a matrix factorization latent feature space to smaller sets of items based on their choices. The results show that compared to a rating-based interface, the choice-based interface requires less effort and results in more satisfying recommendations, showing that it might be a promising candidate for alleviating the cold start problem of new users.</p>

    <h3>Evaluating Recommender Behavior For New Users (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Kluver, Joseph Konstan</p>
    <p>The new user experience is one of the important problems in recommender systems. Past work on recommending for new users has focused on the process of gathering information from the user. Our work focuses on how different algorithms behave for new users. We describe a methodology that we use to compare representatives of three common families of algorithms along eleven different metrics. We find that for the first few ratings a baseline algorithm performs better than three common collaborative filtering algorithms. Once we have a few ratings, we find that Funk’s SVD algorithm has the best overall performance. We also find that ItemItem, a very commonly deployed algorithm, performs very poorly for new users. Our results can inform the design of interfaces and algorithms for new users.</p>
