    <h3>A Lightweight Method for Modeling Confidence in Recommendations with Learned Beta Distributions (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harrie Oosterhuis, Norman Knyazev</p>
    <p>Most recommender systems (RecSys) do not provide an indication of confidence in their decisions. Therefore, they do not distinguish between recommendations of which they are certain, and those where they are not. Existing confidence methods for RecSys are either inaccurate heuristics, conceptually complex or very computationally expensive. Consequently, real-world RecSys applications rarely adopt these methods, and thus, provide no confidence insights in their behavior. In this work, we propose learned beta distributions (LBD) as a simple and practical recommendation method with an explicit measure of confidence. Our main insight is that beta distributions predict user preferences as probability distributions that naturally model confidence on a closed interval, yet can be implemented with the minimal model-complexity. Our results show that LBD maintains competitive accuracy to existing methods while also having a significantly stronger correlation between its accuracy and confidence. Furthermore, LBD has higher performance when applied to a high-precision targeted recommendation task. Our work thus shows that confidence in RecSys is possible without sacrificing simplicity or accuracy, and without introducing heavy computational complexity. Thereby, we hope it enables better insight into real-world RecSys and opens the door for novel future applications.</p>

    <h3>Bayesian Personalized Ranking with Multi-Channel User Feedback (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martha Larson, Roberto Pagano, Babak Loni, Alan Hanjalic</p>
    <p>Pairwise learning-to-rank algorithms have been shown to allow recommender systems to leverage unary user feedback. We propose Multi-feedback Bayesian Personalized Ranking (MF-BPR), a pairwise method that exploits different types of feedback with an extended sampling method. The feedback types are drawn from different “channels”, in which users interact with items (e.g., clicks, likes, listens, follows, and purchases). We build on the insight that different kinds of feedback, e.g., a click versus a like, reflect different levels of commitment or preference. Our approach differs from previous work in that it exploits multiple sources of feedback simultaneously during the training process. The novelty of MF-BPR is an extended sampling method that equates feedback sources with “levels” that reflect the expected contribution of the signal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a series of experiments carried out on three datasets containing multiple types of feedback. Our experimental results demonstrate that with a right sampling method, MF-BPR outperforms BPR in terms of accuracy. We find that the advantage of MF-BPR lies in its ability to leverage level information when sampling negative items.</p>
