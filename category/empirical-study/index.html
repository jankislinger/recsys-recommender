    <h3>Oh, Behave! Country Representation Dynamics Created by Feedback Loops in Music Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Kowald, Markus Schedl, Oleg Lesota, Jonas Geiger, Max Walder</p>
    <p>Recent work suggests that music recommender systems are prone to disproportionally frequent recommendations of music from countries more prominently represented in the training data, notably the US. However, it remains unclear to what extent feedback loops in music recommendation influence the dynamics of such imbalance. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of representation of local (i.e., country-specific) and US-produced music in user profiles and recommendations. To this end, we conduct a feedback loop simulation study using the standardized LFM-2b dataset. The results suggest that most of the investigated recommendation models decrease the proportion of music from local artists in their recommendations. Furthermore, we find that models preserving average proportions of US and local music do not necessarily provide country-calibrated recommendations. We also look into popularity calibration and, surprisingly, find that the most popularity-calibrated model in our study (ItemKNN) provides the least country-calibrated recommendations. In addition, users from less represented countries (e.g., Finland) are, in the long term, most affected by the under-representation of their local music in recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Information-Controllable Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixuan Yang, Zirui Guo, Yanhua Yu, Liang Pang, Tat-Seng Chua, Kangkang Lu, Yuling Wang</p>
    <p>In the evolving landscape of recommender systems, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has become a prominent method for enhancing recommendation performance by alleviating the issue of data sparsity. However, existing GCL-based recommendations often overlook the control of shared information between the contrastive views. In this paper, we initially analyze and experimentally demonstrate these methods often lead to the issue of augmented representation collapse, where the representations between views become excessively similar, diminishing their distinctiveness. To address this issue, we propose the Information-Controllable Graph Contrastive Learning (IGCL) framework, a novel approach that focuses on optimizing the shared information between views to include as much relevant information for the recommendation task as possible while maintaining an appropriate level. In particular, we design the Collaborative Signals Enhanced Augmentation module to infuse the augmented representation with rich, task-relevant collaborative signals. Furthermore, the Information-Controllable Contrastive Learning module is designed to direct control over the magnitude of shared information between the contrastive views to avoid over-similarity. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IGCL, showcasing significant improvements in performance and the capability to alleviate augmented representation collapse.</p>

    <h3>Investigating Overparameterization for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization in Collaborative Filtering (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhi Kawakami, Mahito Sugiyama</p>
    <p>Overparameterization is one of the key techniques in modern machine learning, where a model with the higher complexity can generalize better on test data against the common knowledge of the bias-variance trade-off in classical statistical learning theory. In this paper, we empirically investigate the effect of overparameterization for matrix factorization-based models in collaborative filtering. Surprisingly, we firstly show that the performance of overparameterized non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on test data gets better than that of the underparameterized NMF, which is commonly used to date, and is even competitive with the state-of-the-art collaborative filtering techniques. Moreover, we also show that the double descent phenomenon occurs when we increase the number of parameters of the NMF, where the test error decreases, increases, and decreases again as the model complexity grows, which has been recently reported in various machine learning methods such as deep learning models and kernel methods.</p>

    <h3>Measuring Anti-Relevance: A Study on When Recommendation Algorithms Produce Bad Suggestions (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Bellogin, Pablo Sanchez</p>
    <p>Typically, performance of recommender systems has been measured focusing on the amount of relevant items recommended to the users. However, this perspective provides an incomplete view of an algorithm’s quality, since it neglects the amount of negative recommendations by equating the unknown and negatively interacted items when computing ranking-based evaluation metrics. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework where anti-relevance is seamlessly introduced in several ranking-based metrics; in this way, we obtain a different perspective on how recommenders behave and the type of suggestions they make. Based on our results, we observe that non-personalized approaches tend to return less bad recommendations than personalized ones, however the amount of unknown recommendations is also larger, which explains why the latter tend to suggest more relevant items. Our metrics based on anti-relevance also show the potential to discriminate between algorithms whose performance is very similar in terms of relevance, as we present in two use cases with real algorithms.</p>

    <h3>Geographical Diversification in POI Recommendation: Toward Improved Coverage on Interested Areas (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jungkyu Han, Hayato Yamana</p>
    <p>In recommending POIs, the accuracy is important. However, merely accurate recommendations are useless in real life. Thus, beyond accuracy – such as the diversity of the recommended POIs – is as important as accuracy for a good recommendation. Although existing diversification methods can help POI recommender systems recommend more diverse POIs, they lack “geographical diversification” that results in concentration of “diverse” recommended POIs on “a small portion” of the most active areas of the target-user. This is caused by the neglect of POI locations in the diversification i.e., existing diversification methods try to diversify the categories of recommended items (POIs). However, geographical diversification is indispensable for the user whose activity district consists of many sub-areas and who requires variety of recommended POIs over his/her activity sub-areas. In this paper, we propose a novel proportional geographical diversification method to recommend variety of POIs located in his/her activity district but variety of sub-areas in the district proportional to the frequency of his/her activity to each sub-area. We compared our proposed method with existing diversification methods with real datasets. The evaluation result shows that no methods except for our proposed method can significantly increase geographical diversity at the expense of tolerable accuracy loss.</p>

    <h3>Exploring the Value of Personality in Predicting Rating Behaviors: A Study of Category Preferences on MovieLens (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph A. Konstan, Raghav Pavan Karumur, Tien T. Nguyen</p>
    <p>Prior work relevant to incorporating personality into recommender systems falls into two categories: social science studies and algorithmic ones. Social science studies of preference have found only small relationships between personality and category preferences, whereas, algorithmic approaches found a little improvement when incorporating personality into recommendations. As a result, despite good reasons to believe personality assessments should be useful in recommenders, we are left with no substantial demonstrated impact. In this work, we start with user data from a live recommender system, but study category-by-category variations in preference (both rating levels and distribution) across different personality types. By doing this, we hope to isolate specific areas where personality is most likely to provide value in recommender systems, while also modeling an analytic process that can be used in other domains. After controlling for the family-wise error rate, we find that High Agreeableness users rate at least 0.5 stars higher on a 5-star scale compared to low Agreeableness users. We also find differences in consumption in four different personality types between people who manifested high and low levels of that personality.</p>

    <h3>Overlapping Community Regularization for Rating Prediction in Social Recommender Systems (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dingming Wu, Nikos Mamoulis, Wenbin Tang, Hui Li</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have become de facto tools for suggesting items that are of potential interest to users. Predicting a user’s rating on an item is the fundamental recommendation task. Traditional methods that generate predictions by analyzing the user-item rating matrix perform poorly when the matrix is sparse. Recent approaches use data from social networks to improve accuracy. However, most of the social-network based recommender systems only consider direct friendships and they are less effective when the targeted user has few social connections. In this paper, we propose two alternative models that incorporate the overlapping community regularization into the matrix factorization framework. Our empirical study on four real datasets shows that our approaches outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in both traditional and social-network based recommender systems regarding both cold-start users and normal users.</p>
