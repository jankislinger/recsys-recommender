    <h3>Pay Attention to Attention for Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaojing Liu, Yuli Liu, Min Liu</p>
    <p>Transformer-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in various sequence-based tasks. However, traditional self-attention models may not sufficiently capture the intricate dependencies within items in sequential recommendation scenarios. This is due to the lack of explicit emphasis on attention weights, which play a critical role in allocating attention and understanding item-to-item correlations. To better exploit the potential of attention weights and improve the capability of sequential recommendation in learning high-order dependencies, we propose a novel sequential recommendation (SR) approach called attention weight refinement (AWRSR). AWRSR enhances the effectiveness of self-attention by additionally paying attention to attention weights, allowing for more refined attention distributions of correlations among items. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SR models. Moreover, we provide a thorough analysis of AWRSR’s effectiveness in capturing higher-level dependencies. These findings suggest that AWRSR offers a promising new direction for enhancing the performance of self-attention architecture in SR tasks, with potential applications in other sequence-based problems as well.</p>

    <h3>CR-SoRec: BERT driven Consistency Regularization for Social Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raksha Jalan, Naoyuki Onoe, Tushar Prakash, Brijraj Singh</p>
    <p>In the real world, when we seek our friends’ opinions on various items or events, we request verbal social recommendations. It has been observed that we often turn to our friends for recommendations on a daily basis. The emergence of online social platforms has enabled users to share their opinion with their social connections. Therefore, we should consider users’ social connections to enhance online recommendation performance. The social recommendation aims to fuse social links with user-item interactions to offer more relevant recommendations. Several efforts have been made to develop an effective social recommendation system. However, there are two significant limitations to current methods: First, they haven’t thoroughly explored the intricate relationships between the diverse influences of neighbours on users’ preferences. Second, existing models are vulnerable to overfitting due to the relatively low number of user-item interaction records in the interaction space. For the aforementioned problems,  this paper offers a novel framework called CR-SoRec, an effective recommendation model based on BERT and Consistency Regularization. This model incorporates Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer(BERT) to learn bidirectional context-aware user and item embeddings with neighbourhood sampling. The neighbourhood Sampling technique samples the most influential neighbours for all the users/ items. Further, to effectively use the available user-item interaction data and social ties, we leverage diverse perspectives via consistency regularisation to harness the underlying information. The main objective of our model is to predict the next item that a user would interact with based on its interaction behaviour and social connections. Experimental results show that our model defines a new state-of-the-art on various datasets and outperforms previous work by a significant margin. Extensive experiments are conducted to analyse the method. We release the source code of our model at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CR-SoRec-68F4</p>

    <h3>Modeling User Repeat Consumption Behavior for Online Novel Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cunxiang Yin, Leeven Luo, Yuncong Li, Yancheng He, Guoqiang Xu, Jing Cai, Sheng-hua Zhong</p>
    <p>Given a user’s historical interaction sequence, online novel recommendation suggests the next novel the user may be interested in. Online novel recommendation is important but underexplored. In this paper, we concentrate on recommending online novels to new users of an online novel reading platform, whose first visits to the platform occurred in the last seven days. We have two observations about online novel recommendation for new users. First, repeat novel consumption of new users is a common phenomenon. Second, interactions between users and novels are informative. To accurately predict whether a user will reconsume a novel, it is crucial to characterize each interaction at a fine-grained level. Based on these two observations, we propose a neural network for online novel recommendation, called NovelNet. NovelNet can recommend the next novel from both the user’s consumed novels and new novels simultaneously. Specifically, an interaction encoder is used to obtain accurate interaction representation considering fine-grained attributes of interaction, and a pointer network with a pointwise loss is incorporated into NovelNet to recommend previously-consumed novels. Moreover, an online novel recommendation dataset is built from a well-known online novel reading platform and is released for public use as a benchmark. Experimental results on the dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of NovelNet 1.</p>

    <h3>Field-aware Factorization Machines for CTR Prediction (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchin Juan, Wei-Sheng Chin, Yong Zhuang, Chih-Jen Lin</p>
    <p>Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in computational advertising. Models based on degree-2 polynomial mappings and factorization machines (FMs) are widely used for this task. Recently, a variant of FMs, field-aware factorization machines (FFMs), outperforms existing models in some world-wide CTR-prediction competitions. Based on our experiences in winning two of them, in this paper we establish FFMs as an effective method for classifying large sparse data including those from CTR prediction. First, we propose efficient implementations for training FFMs. Then we comprehensively analyze FFMs and compare this approach with competing models. Experiments show that FFMs are very useful for certain classification problems. Finally, we have released a package of FFMs for public use.</p>
