    <h3>Towards Sustainability-aware Recommender Systems: Analyzing the Trade-off Between Algorithms Performance and Carbon Footprint (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Semeraro, Giuseppe Spillo, Allegra De Filippo, Cataldo Musto, Michela Milano</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of the trade-off between the performance of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and their sustainability. In particular, we compared 18 popular recommendation algorithms in terms of both standard metrics (i.e., accuracy and diversity of the recommendations) as well as in terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint on three different datasets. In order to obtain a fair comparison, all the algorithms were run based on the implementations available in a popular recommendation library, i.e., RecBole, and used the same experimental settings. The outcomes of the experiments clearly showed that the choice of the optimal recommendation algorithm requires a thorough analysis, since more sophisticated algorithms often led to tiny improvements at the cost of an exponential increase of carbon emissions. Through this paper, we aim to shed light on the problem of carbon footprint and energy consumption of recommender systems, and we make the first step towards the development of sustainability-aware recommendation algorithms.</p>

    <h3>Denoising User-aware Memory Network for Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenqi Sun, Xiaolong Li, Kaikui Liu, Junjie Tang, Zhi Bian, Hao Fu, Qihong Yang, Shaojun Zhou, Guiquan Liu</p>
    <p>For better user satisfaction and business effectiveness, more and more attention has been paid to the sequence-based recommendation system, which is used to infer the evolution of users’ dynamic preferences, and recent studies have noticed that the evolution of users’ preferences can be better understood from the implicit and explicit feedback sequences. However, most of the existing recommendation techniques do not consider the noise contained in implicit feedback, which will lead to the biased representation of user interest and a suboptimal recommendation performance. Meanwhile, the existing methods utilize item sequence for capturing the evolution of user interest. The performance of these methods is limited by the length of the sequence, and can not effectively model the long-term interest in a long period of time. Based on this observation, we propose a novel CTR model named denoising user-aware memory network (DUMN). Specifically, the framework: (i) proposes a feature purification module based on orthogonal mapping, which use the representation of explicit feedback to purify the representation of implicit feedback, and effectively denoise the implicit feedback; (ii) designs a user memory network to model the long-term interests in a fine-grained way by improving the memory network, which is ignored by the existing methods; and (iii) develops a preference-aware interactive representation component to fuse the long-term and short-term interests of users based on gating to understand the evolution of unbiased preferences of users. Extensive experiments on two real e-commerce user behavior datasets show that DUMN has a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

    <h3>Audio-Visual Encoding of Multimedia Content to Enhance Movie Recommendations (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Schedl, Bogdan Ionescu, Paolo Cremonesi, Yashar Deldjoo, Mihai Gabriel Constantin, Hamid Eghbal-zadeh</p>
    <p>We propose a multi-modal content-based movie recommender system that replaces human-generated metadata by content descriptions automatically extracted from the visual and audio channels of a video. Content descriptors improve over traditional metadata in terms of both richness (it is possible to extract hundreds of meaningful features covering various modalities) and quality (content features are consistent across different systems and immune to human errors). Our recommender system integrates state-of-the-art aesthetic and deep visual features as well as block-level and i-vector audio features. For fusing the different modalities, we propose a rank aggregation strategy extending the Borda count approach. We evaluate the proposed multi-modal recommender system comprehensively against metadata-based baselines. To this end, we conduct two empirical studies: (i) a system-centric study to measure the offline quality of recommendations in terms of accuracy-related and beyond-accuracy performance measures (novelty, diversity, and coverage), and (ii) a user-centric online experiment, measuring different subjective metrics, including relevance, satisfaction, and diversity. In both studies, we use a dataset of more than 4,000 movie trailers, which makes our approach versatile. Our results shed light on the accuracy and beyond-accuracy performance of audio, visual, and textual features in content-based movie recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Comparing offline and online recommender system evaluations on long-tail distributions (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adilson Cunha, Gabriel de Souza Pereira Moreira, Gilmar Alves de Souzaand</p>
    <p>In this investigation, we conduct a comparison between offline and online accuracy evaluation of different algorithms and settings in a real-world content recommender system. By focusing on recommendations of long-tail items, which are usually more interesting for users, it was possible to reduce the bias caused by extremely popular items and to observe a better alignment of accuracy results in offline and online evaluations.</p>
