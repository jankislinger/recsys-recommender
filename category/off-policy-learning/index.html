    <h3>Optimal Baseline Corrections for Off-Policy Contextual Bandits (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shashank Gupta, Olivier Jeunen, Maarten de Rijke, Harrie Oosterhuis</p>
    <p>The off-policy learning paradigm allows for recommender systems and general ranking applications to be framed as decision-making problems, where we aim to learn decision policies that optimize an unbiased offline estimate of an online reward metric. With unbiasedness comes potentially high variance, and prevalent methods exist to reduce estimation variance. These methods typically make use of control variates, either additive (i.e., baseline corrections or doubly robust methods) or multiplicative (i.e., self-normalisation). Our work unifies these approaches by proposing a single framework built on their equivalence in learning scenarios. The foundation of our framework is the derivation of an equivalent baseline correction for all of the existing control variates. Consequently, our framework enables us to characterize the variance-optimal unbiased estimator and provide a closed-form solution for it. This optimal estimator brings significantly improved performance in both evaluation and learning, and minimizes data requirements. Empirical observations corroborate our theoretical findings.</p>

    <h3>Off-Policy Actor Critic for Recommender Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minmin Chen, Can Xu, Aviral Kumar, Ed Chi, Vince Gatto, Devanshu Jain</p>
    <p>Industrial recommendation platforms are increasingly concerned with how to make recommendations that cause users to enjoy their long term experience on the platform. Reinforcement learning emerged naturally as an appealing approach for its promise in 1) combating feedback loop effect resulted from myopic system behaviors; and 2) sequential planning to optimize long term outcome. Scaling RL algorithms to production recommender systems serving billions of users and contents, however remain challenging. Sample inefficiency and instability of online RL hinder its widespread adoption in production. Offline RL enables usage of off-policy data and batch learning. It on the other hand faces significant challenges in learning due to the distribution shift.<br>A REINFORCE agent [3] was successfully tested for YouTube recommendation, significantly outperforming a sophisticated supervised learning production system. Off-policy correction was employed to learn from logged data. The algorithm partially mitigates the distribution shift by employing a one-step importance weighting. We resort to the off-policy actor critic algorithms to addresses the distribution shift to a better extent. Here we share the key designs in setting up an off-policy actor-critic agent for production recommender systems. It extends  [3] with a critic network that estimates the value of any state-action pairs under the target learned policy through temporal difference learning. We demonstrate in offline and live experiments that the new framework out-performs baseline and improves long term user experience.<br>An interesting discovery along our investigation is that recommendation agents that employ a softmax policy parameterization, can end up being too pessimistic about out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Finding the right balance between pessimism and optimism on OOD actions is critical to the success of offline RL for recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Pessimistic Reward Models for Off-Policy Learning in Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Jeunen, Bart Goethals</p>
    <p>Methods for bandit learning from user interactions often require a model of the reward a certain context-action pair will yield – for example, the probability of a click on a recommendation. This common machine learning task is highly non-trivial, as the data-generating process for contexts and actions is often skewed by the recommender system itself. Indeed, when the deployed recommendation policy at data collection time does not pick its actions uniformly-at-random, this leads to a selection bias that can impede effective reward modelling. This in turn makes off-policy learning – the typical setup in industry – particularly challenging.<br>In this work, we propose and validate a general pessimistic reward modelling approach for off-policy learning in recommendation. Bayesian uncertainty estimates allow us to express scepticism about our own reward model, which can in turn be used to generate a conservative decision rule. We show how it alleviates a well-known decision making phenomenon known as the Optimiser’s Curse, and draw parallels with existing work on pessimistic policy learning. Leveraging the available closed-form expressions for both the posterior mean and variance when a ridge regressor models the reward, we show how to apply pessimism effectively and efficiently to an off-policy recommendation use-case. Empirical observations in a wide range of environments show that being conservative in decision-making leads to a significant and robust increase in recommendation performance. The merits of our approach are most outspoken in realistic settings with limited logging randomisation, limited training samples, and larger action spaces.</p>
