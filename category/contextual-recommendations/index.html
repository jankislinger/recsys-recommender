    <h3>Global and Personalized Graphs for Heterogeneous Sequential Recommendation by Learning Behavior Transitions and User Intentions (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhong Ming, Weike Pan, Yongxin Ni, Weixin Chen, Li Chen, Mingkai He</p>
    <p>Heterogeneous sequential recommendation (HSR) is a very important recommendation problem, which aims to predict a user’s next interacted item under a target behavior type (e.g., purchase in e-commerce sites) based on his/her historical interactions with different behaviors. Though existing sequential methods have achieved advanced performance by considering the varied impacts of interactions with sequential information, a large body of them still have two major shortcomings. Firstly, they usually model different behaviors separately without considering the correlations between them. The transitions from item to item under diverse behaviors indicate some users’ potential behavior manner. Secondly, though the behavior information contains a user’s fine-grained interests, the insufficient consideration of the local context information limits them from well understanding user intentions. Utilizing the adjacent interactions to better understand a user’s behavior could improve the certainty of prediction. To address these two issues, we propose a novel solution utilizing global and personalized graphs for HSR (GPG4HSR) to learn behavior transitions and user intentions. Specifically, our GPG4HSR consists of two graphs, i.e., a global graph to capture the transitions between different behaviors, and a personalized graph to model items with behaviors by further considering the distinct user intentions of the adjacent contextually relevant nodes. Extensive experiments on four public datasets with the state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate the effectiveness and general applicability of our method GPG4HSR.</p>

    <h3>Personalised Outfit Recommendations: Use Cases, Challenges and Opportunities (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nick Landia</p>
    <p>Recommender systems for fashion have gained in popularity in recent years. An exciting novel application for recommender systems is outfit personalisation. This work discusses the problem of personalised outfit recommendations and presents use cases, challenges and opportunities. This is still a nascent application area in many ways and there are opportunities for innovation in generating outfits, personalising them and displaying them in a coherent way to the user.<br>Outfits are different from showing complimentary items (e.g. printer paper when you buy ink, socks when you buy shoes). Complimentary items are mostly about upselling the user to buy further items with their main purchase. Outfits can be that, but they are also about presenting the main item in different contexts. Showing the same dress in a work outfit, an evening outfit and a casual outfit showcases the use and value the user would get out of purchasing the dress (the main item). In retail words, outfits help sell the main item and are not necessarily about upselling the other items in the outfit as well. Outfits are often classified as complimentary item retrieval, however there are some important aspects of outfits that are closer to the concepts of contextual recommendations and full page optimisation (what things do you show next to each other).<br>This extended abstract talks about the different use cases of outfits, gives an overview of the challenges in this domain, and presents scoped problem definitions that are the building blocks that need to be addressed in order to solve personalised outfits.</p>

    <h3>Interpretable Contextual Team-aware Item Recommendation: Application in Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Games (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir Araujo, Denis Parra, Andrés Villa, Francisca Cattan</p>
    <p>The video game industry has adopted recommendation systems to boost users interest with a focus on game sales. Other exciting applications within video games are those that help the player make decisions that would maximize their playing experience, which is a desirable feature in real-time strategy video games such as Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) like as DotA and LoL. Among these tasks, the recommendation of items is challenging, given both the contextual nature of the game and how it exposes the dependence on the formation of each team. Existing works on this topic do not take advantage of all the available contextual match data and dismiss potentially valuable information. To address this problem we develop TTIR, a contextual recommender model derived from the Transformer neural architecture that suggests a set of items to every team member, based on the contexts of teams and roles that describe the match. TTIR outperforms several approaches and provides interpretable recommendations through visualization of attention weights. Our evaluation indicates that both the Transformer architecture and the contextual information are essential to get the best results for this item recommendation task. Furthermore, a preliminary user survey indicates the usefulness of attention weights for explaining recommendations as well as ideas for future work. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ojedaf/IC-TIR-Lol .</p>

    <h3>Modelling Session Activity with Neural Embedding (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yael Brumer, Noam Koenigstein, Oren Barkan</p>
    <p>Neural embedding techniques are being applied in a growing number of machine learning applications. In this work, we demonstrate a neural embedding technique to model users’ session activity. Specifically, we consider a dataset collected from Microsoft’s App Store consisting of user sessions that include sequential click actions and item purchases. Our goal is to learn a latent manifold that captures users’ session activity and can be utilized for contextual recommendations in an online app store.</p>

    <h3>Human-Recommender Systems: From Benchmark Data to Benchmark Cognitive Models (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Shafto, Olfa Nasraoui</p>
    <p>We bring to the fore of the recommender system research community, an inconvenient truth about the current state of understanding how recommender system algorithms and humans influence one another, both computationally and cognitively. Unlike the great variety of supervised machine learning algorithms which traditionally rely on expert input labels and are typically used for decision making by an expert, recommender systems specifically rely on data input from non-expert or casual users and are meant to be used directly by these same non-expert users on an every day basis. Furthermore, the advances in online machine learning, data generation, and predictive model learning have become increasingly interdependent, such that each one feeds on the other in an iterative cycle. Research in psychology suggests that people’s choices are (1) contextually dependent, and (2) dependent on interaction history. Thus, while standard methods of training and assessing performance of recommender systems rely on benchmark datasets, we suggest that a critical step in the evolution of recommender systems is the development of benchmark of human behavior that capture contextual and dynamic aspects of human behavior. It is important to emphasize that even extensive real life user-tests may not be sufficient to make up for this gap in benchmarking validity because user tests are typically done with either a focus on user satisfaction or engagement (clicks, sales, likes, etc) with whatever the recommender algorithm suggests to the user, and thus ignore the human cognitive aspect. We conclude by highlighting the interdisciplinary implications of this endeavor.</p>

    <h3>Factored MDPs for Detecting Topics of User Sessions (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maryam Tavakol, Ulf Brefeld</p>
    <p>Recommender systems aim to capture interests of users to provide tailored recommendations. User interests are however often unique and depend on many unobservable factors including a user’s mood and the local weather. We take a contextual session-based approach and propose a sequential framework using factored Markov decision processes (fMDPs) to detect the user’s goal (the topic) of a session. We show that an independence assumption on the attributes of items leads to a set of independent models that can be optimised efficiently. Our approach results in interpretable topics that can be effectively turned into recommendations. Empirical results on a real world click log from a large e-commerce company exhibit highly accurate topic prediction rates of about 90%. Translating our approach into a topic-driven recommender system outperforms collaborative filtering methods by one order of magnitude.</p>

    <h3>Context Adaptation in Interactive Recommender Systems (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Burke, Negar Hariri, Bamshad Mobasher</p>
    <p>Contextual factors can greatly influence the utility of recommendations for users. In many recommendation and personalization applications, particularly in domains where user context changes dynamically, it is difficult to represent and model contextual factors directly, but it is often possible to observe their impact on user preferences during the course of users’ interactions with the system. In this paper, we introduce an interactive recommender system that can detect and adapt to changes in context based on the user’s ongoing behavior. The system, then, dynamically tailors its recommendations to match the user’s most recent preferences. We formulate this problem as a multi-armed bandit problem and use Thompson sampling heuristic to learn a model for the user. Following the Thompson sampling approach, the user model is updated after each interaction as the system observes the corresponding rewards for the recommendations provided during that interaction. To generate contextual recommendations, the user’s preference model is monitored for changes at each step of interaction with the user and is updated incrementally. We will introduce a mechanism for detecting significant changes in the user’s preferences and will describe how it can be used to improve the performance of the recommender system.</p>
