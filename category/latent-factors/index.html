    <h3>Cross-Domain Latent Factors Sharing via Implicit Matrix Factorization (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexey Vasilev, Anton Vakhrushev, Evgeny Frolov, Abdulaziz Samra, Alexander Grigorevskiy</p>
    <p>Data sparsity has been one of the long-standing problems for recommender systems. One of the solutions to mitigate this issue is to exploit knowledge available in other source domains. However, many cross-domain recommender systems introduce a complex architecture that makes them less scalable in practice. On the other hand, matrix factorization methods are still considered to be strong baselines for single-domain recommendations. In this paper, we introduce the CDIMF, a model that extends the standard implicit matrix factorization with ALS to cross-domain scenarios. We apply the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers to learn shared latent factors for overlapped users while factorizing the interaction matrix. In a dual-domain setting, experiments on industrial datasets demonstrate a competing performance of CDIMF for both cold-start and warm-start. The proposed model can outperform most other recent cross-domain and single-domain models.</p>

    <h3>Latent Multi-Criteria Ratings for Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan Li, Alexander Tuzhilin</p>
    <p>Multi-Criteria Recommender systems have been increasingly valuable for helping the consumers identify the most relevant items with their multi-criteria feedback along different dimensions of user experiences. However, previous design of multi-criteria recommendation algorithms did not take into account user reviews. This is unfortunate because multi-criteria recommender systems suffer from the missing ratings problem and user reviews could be helpful for alleviating the missing ratings and sparsity problem, thus improving the quality of recommendations. Besides, it’s not clear from prior literature how to select the most important criteria to collect from users. In addition, previously proposed methods did not consider the latent semantic relations between users and items. To address these concerns, in this paper we propose a novel design of multi-criteria recommendation based on latent multi-criteria ratings generated from user reviews. In particular, we utilize variational autoencoders to map user reviews into latent embeddings, which are subsequently compressed into smaller dimensional discrete vectors using the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization technique. The resulting compressed vectors constitute latent multi-criteria ratings that we use for the recommendation purposes via standard multi-criteria recommendation methods. We show that the proposed latent multi-criteria rating approach outperforms several baselines significantly and consistently across different datasets and performance evaluation measures. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Towards Understanding Latent Factors and User Profiles by Enhancing Matrix Factorization with Tags (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jürgen Ziegler, Tim Donkers, Benedikt Loepp</p>
    <p>With the interactive recommending approach we have recently proposed, users are given more control over model-based Collaborative Filtering while the results are perceived as more transparent. Integrating the latent factors derived by Matrix Factorization with tags users provided for the items has, however, even more advantages. In this paper, we show how general understanding of the abstract factor space, and of user and item positions inside it, can benefit from the semantics introduced by considering additional information. Moreover, our approach allows us to explain the user’s (former latent) preference profile by means of tags.</p>

    <h3>PushTrust: An Efficient Recommendation Algorithm by Leveraging Trust and Distrust Relations (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdol-Hossein Esfahanian, Hayder Radha, Farzan Masrour, Iman Barjasteh, Rana Forsati</p>
    <p>The significance of social-enhanced recommender systems is increasing, along with its practicality, as online reviews, ratings, friendship links, and follower relationships are increasingly becoming available. In recent years, there has been an upsurge of interest in exploiting social information, such as trust and distrust relations in recommendation algorithms. The goal is to improve the quality of suggestions and mitigate the data sparsity and the cold-start users problems in existing systems. In this paper, we introduce a general model to rank the latent features of users extracted from rating data based on the social context of users. In contrast to existing social regularization methods, the proposed framework is able to simultaneously leverage trust, distrust, and neutral relations, and has a linear dependency on the social network size. By integrating the ranking based social regularization idea into the matrix factorization algorithm, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm, dubbed . Our experiments on the Epinions dataset demonstrate that collaboratively ranking the latent features of users by exploiting trust and distrust relations leads to a substantial increase in performance, and to effectively deal with cold-start users problem.</p>

    <h3>Task-Based User Modelling for Personalization via Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Mehrotra, Emine Yilmaz, Manisha Verma</p>
    <p>We introduce a novel approach to user modelling for behavioral targeting: task-based user representation and present an approach based on search task extraction from search logs wherein users are represented by their actions over a task-space. Given a web search log, we extract search tasks performed by users and nd user representations based on these tasks. More specically, we construct a user-task association matrix and borrow insights from Collaborative Filtering to learn low-dimensional factor model wherein the interests/preferences of a user are determined by a small number of latent factors. We compare the performance of the proposed approach on the task of collaborative query recommendation on publicly available AOL search log with a standard term-similarity baseline and discuss potential future research directions.</p>
