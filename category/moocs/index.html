    <h3>Time Slice Imputation for Personalized Goal-based Recommendation in Higher Education (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary A. Pardos, Weijie Jiang</p>
    <p>Learners are often faced with the following scenario: given a goal for the future, and what they have learned in the past, what should they do now to best achieve their goal? We build on work utilizing deep learning to make inferences about how past actions correspond to future outcomes and enhance this work with a novel application of backpropagation to learn per-user optimized actions. We apply this technique to two datasets, one from a university setting in which courses can be recommended towards preparation for a target course, and one from massive open online courses (MOOCs) in which course pages can be recommended towards quiz preparation. In both cases, our algorithm is applied to recommend actions the learner can take to maximize a desired future achievement objective, given their past actions and performance. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>MoocRec.com: Massive Open Online Courses Recommender System (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Panagiotis Symeonidis, Dimitrios Malakoudis</p>
    <p>Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have recently gained a huge users’ attention on the Web. They are considered as a highly promising form of teaching from leading universities such as Stanford and Berkeley. MoocRec.com is a web site that recommends courses to users so that, they can acquire those skills, that are expected from their ideal job posting. MoocRec’s recommendation engine is based on Matrix Factorization (MF) model combined with Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithm, which exploits information from external resources (i.e., users’ skills, courses’ characteristics, etc.) to predict course trends and to perform rating predictions according to them.</p>

    <h3>Question Recommendation with Constraints for Massive Open Online Courses (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Adamson, Diyi Yang, Carolyn Rose</p>
    <p>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have experienced a recent boom in interest. Although the number of students that have registered for MOOCs is remarkably high, the fraction of those who actively participate in course discussion forums is startlingly low. By recommending relevant forum discussions and questions to students, their engagement and participation may increase, to the benefit of both the student and the course community. This problem has not been thoroughly explored by existing recommender systems. In contrast to traditional product recommendation, question recommendation in discussion forums should consider constraints on both students and questions. These considerations include (1)Load Balancing – students should not be over-burdened with too many requests; and (2) Expertise Matching – matching students’ abilities to the difficulty of unanswered questions, which in turn positions students to contribute meaningfully to the forum. In this work, we propose a novel constrained question recommendation problem to address the above considerations, with the intent to improve the learning experience for course participants. We first design a context-aware matrix factorization model to predict students’ preferences over questions, then build a max cost flow model to address the constraints. Experimental results on three MOOC datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods in optimizing overall forum welfare, and in predicting which questions students might be interested in.</p>
