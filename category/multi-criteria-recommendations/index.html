    <h3>Latent Multi-Criteria Ratings for Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan Li, Alexander Tuzhilin</p>
    <p>Multi-Criteria Recommender systems have been increasingly valuable for helping the consumers identify the most relevant items with their multi-criteria feedback along different dimensions of user experiences. However, previous design of multi-criteria recommendation algorithms did not take into account user reviews. This is unfortunate because multi-criteria recommender systems suffer from the missing ratings problem and user reviews could be helpful for alleviating the missing ratings and sparsity problem, thus improving the quality of recommendations. Besides, it’s not clear from prior literature how to select the most important criteria to collect from users. In addition, previously proposed methods did not consider the latent semantic relations between users and items. To address these concerns, in this paper we propose a novel design of multi-criteria recommendation based on latent multi-criteria ratings generated from user reviews. In particular, we utilize variational autoencoders to map user reviews into latent embeddings, which are subsequently compressed into smaller dimensional discrete vectors using the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization technique. The resulting compressed vectors constitute latent multi-criteria ratings that we use for the recommendation purposes via standard multi-criteria recommendation methods. We show that the proposed latent multi-criteria rating approach outperforms several baselines significantly and consistently across different datasets and performance evaluation measures. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>User Preference Learning in Multi-criteria Recommendations using Stacked Auto Encoders (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bidyut Kr. Patra, Korra Sathya Babu, Dharahas Tallapally, Rama Syamala Sreepada</p>
    <p>Recommender System (RS) has been an essential component of many businesses, especially in e-commerce domain. RS exploits and processes the preference history (rating, purchase, review, etc.) of users in order to provide the recommendations. A user in traditional RS can provide only one rating value about an item. Deep Neural Networks have been used in this single rating system to improve recommendation accuracy in the recent times. However, the single rating systems are inadequate to understand the users’ preferences about an item. On the other hand, business enterprises such as tourism, e-learning, etc. facilitate users to provide multiple criteria ratings about an item, thus it becomes easier to understand users’ preference over single rating system. In this paper, we propose an extended Stacked Autoencoders (a Deep Neural Network technique) to utilize the multi-criteria ratings. The proposed network is designed to learn the relationship between each user’s criteria ratings and overall rating efficiently. Experimental results on real world datasets (Yahoo! Movies and TripAdvisor) demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art single rating systems and multi-criteria approaches on various performance metrics.</p>

    <h3>A Multi-criteria Recommender System Exploiting Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis of Users’ Reviews (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco De Gemmis, Giovanni Semeraro, Cataldo Musto, Pasquale Lops</p>
    <p>In this paper we propose a multi-criteria recommender system based on collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, which exploits the information conveyed by users’ reviews to provide a multi-faceted representation of users’ interests. To this end, we exploited a framework for opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which automatically extracts relevant aspects and sentiment scores from users’ reviews. As an example, in a restaurant recommendation scenario, the aspects may regard food quality, service, position, atmosphere of the place and so on. Such a multi-faceted representation of the user is used to feed a multi-criteria CF algorithm which predicts user interest in a particular item and provides her with recommendations. In the experimental session we evaluated the performance of the algorithm against several state-of-the-art baselines; Results confirmed the insight behind this work, since our approach was able to overcome both single-criteria recommendation algorithms as well as more sophisticated techniques based on matrix factorization.</p>
