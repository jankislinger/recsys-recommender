    <h3>A Novel Evaluation Perspective on GNNs-based Recommender Systems through the Topology of the User-Item Graph (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Carlo Maria Mancino, Vito Walter Anelli, Claudio Pomo, Tommaso Di Noia, Eugenio Di Sciascio, Daniele Malitesta</p>
    <p>Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs)-based recommender systems have encountered great success in recommendation. As the number of GNNs approaches rises, some works have started questioning the theoretical and empirical reasons behind their superior performance. Nevertheless, this investigation still disregards that GNNs treat the recommendation data as a topological graph structure. Building on this assumption, in this work, we provide a novel evaluation perspective on GNNs-based recommendation, which investigates the impact of the graph topology on the recommendation performance. To this end, we select some (topological) properties of the recommendation data and three GNNs-based recommender systems (i.e., LightGCN, DGCF, and SVD-GCN). Then, starting from three popular recommendation datasets (i.e., Yelp2018, Gowalla, and Amazon-Book) we sample them to obtain 1,800 size-reduced datasets that still resemble the original ones but can encompass a wider range of topological structures. We use this procedure to build a large pool of samples for which data characteristics and recommendation performance of the selected GNNs models are measured. Through an explanatory framework, we find strong correspondences between graph topology and GNNs performance, offering a novel evaluation perspective on these models.</p>

    <h3>Towards Self-Explaining Sequence-Aware Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Boratto, Alejandro Ariza-Casabona, Maria Salamo, Gianni Fenu</p>
    <p>Self-explaining models are becoming an important perk of recommender systems, as they help users understand the reason behind certain recommendations, which encourages them to interact more often with the platform. In order to personalize recommendations, modern recommender approaches make the model aware of the user behavior history for interest evolution representation. However, existing explainable recommender systems do not consider the past user history to further personalize the explanation based on the user interest fluctuation. In this work, we propose a SEQuence-Aware Explainable Recommendation model (SEQUER) that is able to leverage the sequence of user-item review interactions to generate better explanations while maintaining recommendation performance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposal on multiple recommendation scenarios. Our source code and preprocessed datasets are available at https://tinyurl.com/SEQUER-RECSYS23.</p>

    <h3>Long-tail Session-based Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyi Liu, Yujia Zheng</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendation focuses on the prediction of user actions based on anonymous sessions and is a necessary method in the lack of user historical data. However, none of the existing session-based recommendation methods explicitly takes the long-tail recommendation into consideration, which plays an important role in improving the diversity of recommendation and producing the serendipity. As the distribution of items with long-tail is prevalent in session-based recommendation scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, music, and TV program recommendations), more attention should be put on the long-tail session-based recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture, namely TailNet, to improve long-tail recommendation performance, while maintaining competitive accuracy performance compared with other methods. We start by classifying items into short-head (popular) and long-tail (niche) items based on click frequency. Then a novel preference mechanism is proposed and applied in TailNet to determine user preference between two types of items, so as to softly adjust and personalize recommendations. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art works.</p>

    <h3>Additive Co-Clustering with Social Influence for Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liping Jing, Huafeng Liu, Xixi Du</p>
    <p>Recommender system is a popular tool to accurately and actively provide users with potentially interesting information. For capturing the users’ preferences and approximating the missing data, matrix completion and approximation are widely adopted. Except for the typical low-rank factorization-based methods, the additive co-clustering approach (ACCAMS) is recently proposed to succinctly approximate large-scale rating matrix. Although ACCAMS efficiently produces effective recommendation result, it still suffers from the cold-start problem. To address this issue, we propose a Social Influence Additive Co-Clustering method (SIACC) by making use of user-item rating data and user-user social relations. The main idea of SIACC is to extract the social influences from the social network, integrate them to additive co-clustering for effectively determining the user clusters and item clusters, minimize the loss error by backfitting the residuals of data approximation in the previous iteration, and finally improve the recommendation performance. In order to take advantage of social influence, we present a graph-regularized weighted-Fuzzy C-Means algorithm (gwFCM) to cluster users. gwFCM has ability to identify user groups from both rating and social information. Specifically, gwFCM makes sure that a pair of users have similar cluster membership if they have direct social relation (denoted as local social influence), and that the user with higher reputation (denoted as global social influence) plays a dominate role in clustering process. The reasonable user clusters obtained by gwFCM can benefit the item clustering, which will leverage the additive co-clustering processing and further improve the recommendation performance. A series of experiments on three real-world datasets have shown that SIACC outperforms the existing popular recommendation methods (PMF and ACCAMS) and social recommendation methods (SoReg, TrustMF, Locabal and SPF), especially on the cold-start users recommendation and running time.</p>

    <h3>Local Item-Item Models For Top-N Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> George Karypis, Evangelia Christakopoulou</p>
    <p>Item-based approaches based on SLIM (Sparse LInear Methods) have demonstrated very good performance for top-N recommendation; however they only estimate a single model for all the users. This work is based on the intuition that not all users behave in the same way — instead there exist subsets of like-minded users. By using different item-item models for these user subsets, we can capture differences in their preferences and this can lead to improved performance for top-N recommendations. In this work, we extend SLIM by combining global and local SLIM models. We present a method that computes the prediction scores as a user-specific combination of the predictions derived by a global and local item-item models. We present an approach in which the global model, the local models, their user-specific combination, and the assignment of users to the local models are jointly optimized to improve the top-N recommendation performance. Our experiments show that the proposed method improves upon the standard SLIM model and outperforms competing top-N recommendation approaches.</p>
