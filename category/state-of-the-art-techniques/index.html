    <h3>Investigating Overparameterization for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization in Collaborative Filtering (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhi Kawakami, Mahito Sugiyama</p>
    <p>Overparameterization is one of the key techniques in modern machine learning, where a model with the higher complexity can generalize better on test data against the common knowledge of the bias-variance trade-off in classical statistical learning theory. In this paper, we empirically investigate the effect of overparameterization for matrix factorization-based models in collaborative filtering. Surprisingly, we firstly show that the performance of overparameterized non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on test data gets better than that of the underparameterized NMF, which is commonly used to date, and is even competitive with the state-of-the-art collaborative filtering techniques. Moreover, we also show that the double descent phenomenon occurs when we increase the number of parameters of the NMF, where the test error decreases, increases, and decreases again as the model complexity grows, which has been recently reported in various machine learning methods such as deep learning models and kernel methods.</p>

    <h3>Together is Better: Hybrid Recommendations Combining Graph Embeddings and Contextualized Word Representations (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco de Gemmis, Cataldo Musto, Marco Polignano, Pasquale Lops, Giovanni Semeraro</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present a hybrid recommendation framework based on the combination of graph embeddings and contextual word representations. Our approach is based on the intuition that each of the above mentioned representation models heterogeneous (and equally important) information, that is worth to be taken into account to generate a recommendation. Accordingly, we propose a strategy to combine both the features, which is based on the following steps: first, we separately generate graph embeddings and contextual word representations by exploiting state-of-the-art techniques. Next, these embeddings are used to feed a deep architecture that learns a hybrid representation based on the combination of the single groups of features. Finally, we exploit the resulting embedding to identify suitable recommendations. In the experimental session, we evaluate the effectiveness of our strategy on two datasets and results show that the use of a hybrid representation leads to an improvement of the predictive accuracy. Moreover, our approach overcomes several competitive baselines, thus confirming the validity of this work.</p>
