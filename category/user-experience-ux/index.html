    <h3>Identifying Controversial Pairs in Item-to-Item Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Goodman Gu, Sindhu Vijaya Raghavan, Junyi Shen, Rob Monarch, Jin Cao, Dayvid Rodrigues de Oliveira, Brian Knott</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems in large-scale online marketplaces are essential to aiding users in discovering new content. However, state-of-the-art systems for item-to-item recommendation tasks are often based on a shallow level of contextual relevance, which can make the system insufficient for tasks where item relationships are more nuanced. Contextually relevant item pairs can sometimes have controversial or problematic relationships, and they could degrade user experiences and brand perception when recommended to users. For example, a  recommendation of a divorce and co-parenting book can create a disturbing experience for someone who is downloading or viewing a marriage therapy book. In this paper, we propose a classifier to identify and prevent such problematic item-to-item recommendations and to enhance overall user experiences. The proposed approach utilizes active learning to sample hard examples effectively across sensitive item categories and uses human raters for data labeling. We also perform offline experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of this system for identifying and filtering controversial recommendations while maintaining recommendation quality.</p>

    <h3>Recommender Systems and Algorithmic Hate (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Burke, Lucia Jayne, Jessie Smith</p>
    <p>Despite increasing reliance on personalization in digital platforms, many algorithms that curate content or information for users have been met with resistance. When users feel dissatisfied or harmed by recommendations, this can lead users to hate, or feel negatively towards these personalized systems. Algorithmic hate detrimentally impacts both users and the system, and can result in various forms of algorithmic harm, or in extreme cases can lead to public protests against “the algorithm” in question. In this work, we summarize some of the most common causes of algorithmic hate and their negative consequences through various case studies of personalized recommender systems. We explore promising future directions for the RecSys research community that could help alleviate algorithmic hate and improve the relationship between recommender systems and their users.</p>

    <h3>Personalised Outfit Recommendations: Use Cases, Challenges and Opportunities (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nick Landia</p>
    <p>Recommender systems for fashion have gained in popularity in recent years. An exciting novel application for recommender systems is outfit personalisation. This work discusses the problem of personalised outfit recommendations and presents use cases, challenges and opportunities. This is still a nascent application area in many ways and there are opportunities for innovation in generating outfits, personalising them and displaying them in a coherent way to the user.<br>Outfits are different from showing complimentary items (e.g. printer paper when you buy ink, socks when you buy shoes). Complimentary items are mostly about upselling the user to buy further items with their main purchase. Outfits can be that, but they are also about presenting the main item in different contexts. Showing the same dress in a work outfit, an evening outfit and a casual outfit showcases the use and value the user would get out of purchasing the dress (the main item). In retail words, outfits help sell the main item and are not necessarily about upselling the other items in the outfit as well. Outfits are often classified as complimentary item retrieval, however there are some important aspects of outfits that are closer to the concepts of contextual recommendations and full page optimisation (what things do you show next to each other).<br>This extended abstract talks about the different use cases of outfits, gives an overview of the challenges in this domain, and presents scoped problem definitions that are the building blocks that need to be addressed in order to solve personalised outfits.</p>

    <h3>Explainable Recommendation for Repeat Consumption (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masataka Goto, Kosetsu Tsukuda</p>
    <p>Displaying appropriate explanations for recommended items is of vital importance for improving the persuasiveness and user satisfaction of recommender systems. Although a user often consumes the same item repeatedly in some domains such as music and restaurants, existing studies have focused on generating explanations for recommending novel items. In this paper, we describe the concept of explainable recommendation for repeatedly consumed items. Because of the high proportion of repeat consumption in music listening, we suggest nine kinds of explanations for song recommendations according to three factors: personal, social, and item factors. From the results of an online survey involving 622 participants, we evaluate the usefulness of these explanations.</p>

    <h3>A Human Perspective on Algorithmic Similarity (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary Schendel</p>
    <p>In the Netflix user interface (UI), when a row or UI element is named “Because you Watched...”, “More Like This”, or “Because you added to your list”, the overarching goal is to recommend a movie or TV show that a member might like based on the fact that they took a meaningful action on a source item. We have employed similar recommendations in many UI elements: on the homepage as a row of recommendations, after you click into a title, or as a piece of information about why a member should watch a title. <br>From an algorithmic perspective, there are many ways to define a “successful” similar recommendation. We sought to broaden the definition of success. To this end, the Consumer Insights team recently completed a suite of research projects to explore the intricacies of member perceptions of similar recommendations. The Netflix Consumer Insights team employs qualitative (e.g., in-depth interviews) and quantitative (e.g., surveys) research methods, interfacing directly with Netflix members to uncover pain points that can inspire new product innovation. The research concluded that, while the typical member believes movies are broadly similar when they share a common genre or theme, similarity is more complex, nuanced, and personal than we might have imagined. The vernacular we use in the UI implies that there should be at least some kind of relationship between the source item and the recommendations that follow. Many of our similar recommendations felt “out of place”, mostly because the relationship between the source item and the recommendation was unclear or absent. When similar recommendations tell a completely misleading, incorrect, or confusing story, member trust can be broken.<br>We will structure the presentation around three new insights that our research found to have an influence on the perception of similarity in the context of Netflix as well as the research methods used to uncover those insights. First, the reason a member loves a given movie will vary. For example, do you want to watch other baseball movies like Field of Dreams, or would you prefer other romances like Field of Dreams? Second, members are more or less flexible about how similar a recommendation actually needs to be depending on the properties of and their interactions with the canvas containing the recommendation. For example, a Because You Watched row on the homepage implies vaguer similarity while a More Like This gallery behind a click into the source item implies stricter similarity. Finally, even when we held the UI element constant, we found that similar recommendations are only valuable in some contexts. After finishing a movie, a member might prefer a similar recommendation one day and a change of pace the next. Research methods discussed will include single-arrangement Inverse Multi-Dimensional Scaling [1], survey experimentation, and ways to apply qualitative research to improve algorithmic recommendations.</p>

    <h3>A Probabilistic Model for Intrusive Recommendation Assessment (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rim Faiz, Mohand Boughanem, Imen Akermi</p>
    <p>The overwhelming advances in mobile technologies allow recommender systems to be highly contextualized and able to deliver recommendation without an explicit request. However, it is no longer enough for a recommender system to determine what to recommend according to the users’ needs, but it also has to deal with the risk of disturbing the user during recommendation. We believe that mobile technologies along with contextual information may help alleviate this issue. In this paper, we address intrusiveness as a probabilistic approach that makes use of the several embedded applications within the user’s device and the user’s contextual information in order to figure out intrusive recommendations that are subject to rejection. The experiments that we conducted have shown that the proposed approach yields promising results.</p>
