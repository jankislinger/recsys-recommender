    <h3>A Dataset for Adapting Recommender Systems to the Fashion Rental Economy (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jivitesh Sharma, Karl Audun Borgersen, Morten Goodwin, Morten Grundetjern</p>
    <p>In response to the escalating ecological challenges that threaten global sustainability, there’s a deep need to investigate alternative methods of commerce, such as rental economies. Like most online commerce, rental or otherwise, a functioning recommender system is crucial for their success. Yet the domain has, until this point, been largely neglected by the recommender system research community. Our dataset, derived from our collaboration with the leading Norwegian fashion rental company [Company name omitted for review process], encompasses 64k transactions, rental histories from 2.2k anonymized users, and 15.8k unique outfits in which each physical item’s attributes and rental history is meticulously tracked. All outfits are listed as individual items or their corresponding item groups, referring to shared designs between the individual items. This approach underlines the novel challenges of rental as compared to more traditional recommender system problems where items are generally interchangeable. Each outfit is accompanied by a set of tags describing some of their attributes. We also provide a total of 50k images displaying across all items along with a set of precomputed zero-shot embeddings. We apply a myriad of common recommender system methods to the dataset to provide a performance baseline. This baseline is performed for the traditional fashion recommender system problem of recommending outfit groups and the novel problem of predicting individual item rental. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset discussing the domain of clothes rental. It is our hope that the publication of this dataset will serve as a catalyst for a new branch of research for specialized fashion rental recommender systems. The dataset is temporarily hosted at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/clothes_rental_dataset-B1E8/ and Google Cloud at https: //console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/clothes-rental-dataset The code for collecting, processing, and evaluating the dataset is hosted at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Vibrent_Dataset_Collection-03DC/</p>

    <h3>DataRec: A System for Finding Datasets Based on Scientific Problem Descriptions (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ann-Kathrin Leisinger, Michael Färber</p>
    <p>The number of datasets is steadily rising, making it increasingly difficult for researchers and practitioners in the various scientific disciplines to be aware of all datasets, particularly of the most relevant datasets for a given research problem. To this end, dataset search engines have been proposed. However, they are based on the users’ keywords and thus have difficulties in determining precisely fitting datasets for complex research problems. In this paper, we propose the system at http://data-hunter.io that recommends suitable datasets to users based on given research problem descriptions. It is based on fastText for the text representation and text classification, the Data Set Knowledge Graph (DSKG) with metadata about almost 1,700 unique datasets, as well as 88,000 paper abstracts as research problem descriptions for training the model. Overall, our system demonstrates that recommending datasets facilitates data provisioning and reuse according to the FAIR principles and that dataset recommendation is a promising future research direction.</p>

    <h3>Compositional Network Embedding for Link Prediction (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Jiang, Wenwu Ou, Tianshu Lyu, Fei Sun, Yan Zhang</p>
    <p>Network embedding has proved extremely useful in a variety of network analysis tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and network visualization. Almost all the existing network embedding methods learn to map the node IDs to their corresponding node embeddings. This design principle, however, hinders the existing methods from being applied in real cases. Node ID is not generalizable and, thus, the existing methods have to pay great effort in cold-start problem. The heterogeneous network usually requires extra work to encode node types, as node type is not able to be identified by node ID. Node ID carries rare information, resulting in the criticism that the existing methods are not robust to noise. To address this issue, we introduce Compositional Network Embedding, a general inductive network representation learning framework that generates node embeddings by combining node features based on the ‘principle of compositionally’. Instead of directly optimizing an embedding lookup based on arbitrary node IDs, we learn a composition function that infers node embeddings by combining the corresponding node attribute embeddings through a graph-based loss. For evaluation, we conduct the experiments on link prediction under four different settings. The results verified the effectiveness and generalization ability of compositional network embeddings, especially on unseen nodes. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Recommending Social-Interactive Games for Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Soledad Pera, Yiu-Kai D. Ng</p>
    <p>Games play a significant role in modern society, since they affect people of all ages and all walks of life, whether it be socially or mentally, and have direct impacts on adults with autism. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by qualitative impairments in social relatedness and interaction, as well as difficulties in acquiring and using communication and language abilities. Adults with ASD often find it difficult to express and recognize emotions which makes it hard for them to interact with others socially. We have designed new interactive and collaborative games for autistic adults and developed a novel strategy to recommend games to them. Using modern computer vision and graphics techniques, we (i) track the player’s speech rate, facial features, eye contact, audio communication, and emotional states, and (ii) foster their collaboration. These games are personalized and recommended to a user based on games interested to the user, besides the complexity of games at different levels according to the deficient level of the emotional understanding and social skills to which the user belongs. The objective of developing and recommending short-head (i.e., familiar) and long-tail (i.e., unfamiliar) games for adults with ASD is to enhance their necessary social interacting skills with peers so that they can live a normal life.</p>

    <h3>WMRB: Learning to Rank in a Scalable Batch Training Approach (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuan Liu, Prem Natarajan</p>
    <p>We propose a new learning to rank algorithm, named Weighted Margin-Rank Batch loss (WMRB), to extend the popular Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise loss (WARP). WMRB uses a new rank estimator and an efficient batch training algorithm. The approach allows more accurate item rank approximation and explicit utilization of parallel computation to accelerate training. In three item recommendation tasks, WMRB consistently outperforms WARP and other baselines. Moreover, WMRB shows clear time efficiency advantages as data scale increases.</p>

    <h3>Analysis of User-generated Content for Improving YouTube Video Recommendation (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabio Gasparetti, Davide Feltoni Gurini, Alessandro Micarelli, Giuseppe Sansonetti, Michele Galli</p>
    <p>Everyday video-sharing websites such as YouTube collect large amounts of new multimedia resources. Comments left by viewers often provide valuable information to describe sentiments, opinions and tastes of users. For this reason, we propose a novel re-ranking approach that takes into consideration that information in order to provide better recommendations of related videos. Early experiments indicate an improvement in the recommendation performance.</p>
