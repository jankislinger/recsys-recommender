    <h3>Why the Shooting in the Dark Method Dominates Recommender Systems Practice (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Rohde</p>
    <p>The introduction of A/B Testing represented a great leap forward in recommender systems research. Like the randomized control trial for evaluating drug efficacy; A/B Testing has equipped recommender systems practitioners with a protocol for measuring performance as defined by actual business metrics and with minimal assumptions. While A/B testing provided a way to measure the performance of two or more candidate systems, it provides no guide for determining what policy we should test. The focus of this industry talk is to better understand, why the development of A/B testing was the last great leap forward in the development of reward optimizing recommender systems despite more than a decade of efforts in both industry and academia. The talk will survey: industry best practice, standard theories and tools including: collaborative filtering (MovieLens RecSys), contextual bandits, attribution, off-policy estimation, causal inference, click through rate models and will explain why we have converged on a fundamentally heuristic solution or guess and check type method. The talk will offer opinions about which of these theories are useful, and which are not and make a concrete proposal to make progress based on a non-standard use of deep learning tools.</p>

    <h3>On the Robustness and Discriminative Power of IR Metrics for Top-N Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Bellogin, Daniel Valcarce, Pablo Castells, Javier Parapar</p>
    <p>The evaluation of Recommender Systems is still an open issue in the field. Despite its limitations, offline evaluation usually constitutes the first step in assessing recommendation methods due to its reduced costs and high reproducibility. Selecting the appropriate metric is a central issue in offline evaluation. Among the properties of recommendation systems, ranking accuracy attracts the most attention nowadays. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the advantages of different ranking metrics which were previously used in Information Retrieval and are now typically used for assessing top-N recommender systems. We propose methodologies for comparing the robustness and the discriminative power of different metrics. On the one hand, we study the influence of cut-offs and we find that deeper cut-offs offer greater robustness and discriminative power. On the other hand, we find that precision offers high robustness and Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain provides the best discriminative power.</p>
