    <h3>Improving Group Recommendations using Personality, Dynamic Clustering and Multi-Agent MicroServices (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> André Martins, Goreti Marreiros, Patrícia Alves, Paulo Novais</p>
    <p>The complexity associated to group recommendations needs strategies to mitigate several problems, such as the group’s heterogeinity and conflicting preferences, the emotional contagion phenomenon, the cold-start problem, and the group members’ needs and concerns while providing recommendations that satisfy all members at once. In this demonstration, we show how we implemented a Multi-Agent Microservice to represent the tourists in a mobile Group Recommender System for Tourism prototype. A novel dynamic clustering process is presented to help minimize the group’s heterogeneity and conflicting preferences. To help solve the cold-start problem, the preliminary tourist attractions preference and travel-related preferences & concerns are predicted using the tourists’ personality, while taking the tourists’ disabilities and fears into account. Although there is no need for previous interactions data to build the tourists’ profile since we predict the tourists’ preferences, the tourist agents learn with each other by using association rules to find patterns in the tourists’ profile and in the ratings given to Points of Interest to refine the recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Bundle MCR: Towards Conversational Bundle Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhankui He, Sungchul Kim, Handong Zhao, Fan Du, Tong Yu, Julian McAuley</p>
    <p>Bundle recommender systems recommend sets of items (e.g., pants, shirt, and shoes) to users, but they often suffer from two issues: significant interaction sparsity and a large output space. In this work, we extend multi-round conversational recommendation (MCR) to alleviate these issues. MCR—which uses a conversational paradigm to elicit user interests by asking user preferences on tags (e.g., categories or attributes) and handling user feedback across multiple rounds—is an emerging recommendation setting to acquire user feedback and narrow down the output space, but has not been explored in the context of bundle recommendation. In this work, we propose a novel recommendation task named Bundle MCR. Unlike traditional bundle recommendation (a bundle-aware user model and bundle generation), Bundle MCR studies how to encode user feedback as conversation states and how to post questions to users. Unlike existing MCR in which agents recommend individual items only, Bundle MCR handles more complicated user feedback on multiple items and related tags. To support this, we first propose a new framework to formulate Bundle MCR as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with multiple agents, for user modeling, consultation and feedback handling in bundle contexts. Under this framework, we propose a model architecture, called Bundle Bert (Bunt) to (1) recommend items, (2) post questions and (3) manage conversations based on bundle-aware conversation states. Moreover, to train Bunt effectively, we propose a two-stage training strategy. In an offline pre-training stage, Bunt is trained using multiple cloze tasks to mimic bundle interactions in conversations. Then in an online fine-tuning stage, Bunt agents are enhanced by user interactions. Our experiments on multiple offline datasets as well as the human evaluation show the value of extending MCR frameworks to bundle settings and the effectiveness of our Bunt design.</p>

    <h3>Learning to Collaborate in Multi-Module Recommendation via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning without Communication (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haikai Chen, Bo An, Rundong Wang, Xu He, Yanghua Li, Runsheng Yu, Zhirong Wang, Xin Li, Xinrun Wang</p>
    <p>With the rise of online e-commerce platforms, more and more customers prefer to shop online. To sell more products, online platforms introduce various modules to recommend items with different properties such as huge discounts. A web page often consists of different independent modules. The ranking policies of these modules are decided by different teams and optimized individually without cooperation, which might result in competition between modules. Thus, the global policy of the whole page could be sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent cooperative reinforcement learning approach with the restriction that different modules cannot communicate. Our contributions are three-fold. Firstly, inspired by a solution concept in game theory named correlated equilibrium, we design a signal network to promote cooperation of all modules by generating signals (vectors) for different modules. Secondly, an entropy-regularized version of the signal network is proposed to coordinate agents’ exploration of the optimal global policy. Furthermore, experiments based on real-world e-commerce data demonstrate that our algorithm obtains superior performance over baselines.</p>
