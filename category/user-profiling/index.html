    <h3>Improving Group Recommendations using Personality, Dynamic Clustering and Multi-Agent MicroServices (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> André Martins, Goreti Marreiros, Patrícia Alves, Paulo Novais</p>
    <p>The complexity associated to group recommendations needs strategies to mitigate several problems, such as the group’s heterogeinity and conflicting preferences, the emotional contagion phenomenon, the cold-start problem, and the group members’ needs and concerns while providing recommendations that satisfy all members at once. In this demonstration, we show how we implemented a Multi-Agent Microservice to represent the tourists in a mobile Group Recommender System for Tourism prototype. A novel dynamic clustering process is presented to help minimize the group’s heterogeneity and conflicting preferences. To help solve the cold-start problem, the preliminary tourist attractions preference and travel-related preferences & concerns are predicted using the tourists’ personality, while taking the tourists’ disabilities and fears into account. Although there is no need for previous interactions data to build the tourists’ profile since we predict the tourists’ preferences, the tourist agents learn with each other by using association rules to find patterns in the tourists’ profile and in the ratings given to Points of Interest to refine the recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Who do you think I am? Interactive User Modelling with Item Metadata (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bart Goethals, Koen Ruymbeek, Joey De Pauw</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are used in many different applications and contexts, however their main goal can always be summarised as “connecting relevant content to interested users”. Explanations have been found to help recommender systems achieve this goal by giving users a look under the hood that helps them understand why they are recommended certain items. Furthermore, explanations can be considered to be the first step towards interacting with the system. Indeed, for a user to give feedback and guide the system towards better understanding her preferences, it helps if the user has a better idea of what the system has already learned.<br>To this end, we propose a linear collaborative filtering recommendation model that builds user profiles within the domain of item metadata. Our method is hence inherently transparent and explainable. Moreover, since recommendations are computed as a linear function of item metadata and the interpretable user profile, our method seamlessly supports interactive recommendation. In other words, users can directly tweak the weights of the learned profile for more fine-grained browsing and discovery of content based on their current interests. We demonstrate the interactive aspect of this model in an online application for discovering cultural events in Belgium.</p>

    <h3>Modeling Users and Items for Recommenders: There Is More than Semantics (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mete Sertkan</p>
    <p>Recommender systems aim to help us to take better decisions and thus to save resources and increase satisfaction. Personalized recommendations are their main asset. In some domains, such as tourism or news, recommender systems rely more on content-based approaches to give personalized recommendations, due to domain-specific challenges. Content-based methods tend to recommend items semantically similar to the users’ previous consumptions. However, the content of items (e.g., text, visuals, categories, etc.) usually contains more than semantic properties.<br>In this PhD work we focus on the multifaceted nature of the recommendation items. Besides the mentioned semantic properties, we also take into account visual and textual style elements and more complex concepts such as emotions and personality. Our aim is to address people also on a non-rational, non-verbal, and rather emotional level; and thus, to improve recommendations. We propose a statistical-learning-based characterization of items, a picture-based approach to profile users and items, and a neural end-to-end approach, where we learn to represent users and items, and simultaneously to recommend. In all of the proposed methods we consider in addition to the semantic content either stylistic elements and/or more complex concepts like personality, and observe their impact. To contribute the community, we plan to open source our code and the datasets (to the extent our collaborators agree).</p>

    <h3>Fit to Run: Personalised Recommendations for Marathon Training (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aonghus Lawlor, Barry Smyth, Jakim Berndsen</p>
    <p>Training for the marathon is a complex problem. In order to run an optimal time, runners must find the right workload for their current abilities and identify the correct balance between the hard work and rest throughout their training programmes. We propose a recommender system that will help guide runners through the weeks leading up to the marathon. Using a large sample of marathon training data (8730 runners), we generate user profiles that capture both a runner’s current fitness and training levels, and leverage this information to generate tailored recommendations for future weeks of training. We investigate patterns of successful runners to determine how best to schedule recommendations and training to allow for improvement in fitness levels alongside adequate rest.</p>

    <h3>Adversarial Attacks on an Oblivious Recommender (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantina Christakopoulou, Arindam Banerjee</p>
    <p>Can machine learning models be easily fooled? Despite the recent surge of interest in  learned adversarial attacks in other domains, in the context of recommendation systems this question has mainly been answered using hand-engineered fake user profiles. This paper attempts to reduce this gap. We provide a formulation for learning to attack a recommender as a repeated general-sum game between two players, i.e., an adversary and a recommender oblivious to the adversary’s existence. We consider the challenging case of poisoning attacks, which focus on the training phase of the recommender model. We generate adversarial user profiles targeting subsets of users or items, or generally the top-K recommendation quality. Moreover, we ensure that the adversarial user profiles remain unnoticeable by preserving proximity of the real user rating/ interaction distribution to the adversarial fake user distribution. To cope with the challenge of the adversary not having access to the gradient of the recommender’s objective with respect to the fake user profiles, we provide a non-trivial algorithm building upon zero-order optimization techniques. We offer a wide range of experiments, instantiating the proposed method for the case of the classic popular approach of a low-rank recommender, and illustrating the extent of the recommender’s vulnerability to a variety of adversarial intents. These results can serve as a motivating point for more research into recommender defense strategies against machine learned attacks.</p>

    <h3>A Comparison of Calibrated and Intent-Aware Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Derek Bridge, Mesut Kaya</p>
    <p>Calibrated and intent-aware recommendation are recent approaches to recommendation that have apparent similarities. Both try, to a certain extent, to cover the user’s interests, as revealed by her user profile. In this paper, we compare them in detail. On two datasets, we show the extent to which intent-aware recommendations are calibrated and the extent to which calibrated recommendations are diverse. We consider two ways of defining a user’s interests, one based on item features, the other based on subprofiles of the user’s profile. We find that defining interests in terms of subprofiles results in highest precision and the best relevance/diversity trade-off. Along the way, we define a new version of calibrated recommendation and three new evaluation metrics.</p>

    <h3>Preference Elicitation as an Optimization Problem (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filip Radlinski, Maarten de Rijke, Julia Kiseleva, Anna Sepliarskaia</p>
    <p>The new user cold-start problem arises when a recommender system does not yet have any information about a user. A common solution to this problem is to generate a user profile as part of the sign-up process, by asking the user to rate several items. We propose a new elicitation method to generate a static preference questionnaire (SPQ) that asks a new user to make pairwise comparisons between items by posing relative preference questions. Using a latent factor model, SPQ improves personalized recommendations by choosing a minimal and diverse set of static preference questions to ask any new user. We are the first to rigorously prove which optimization task should be solved in order to select the next preference question for static questionnaires. Our theoretical results are confirmed by extensive experimentation. We test the performance of SPQ on two real-world datasets, under two experimental conditions: simulated, when users behave according to LFM, and real, in which there is no user rating model. SPQ reduces the questionnaire length that is necessary to make accurate recommendations for new users by up to a factor of three compared to state-of-the-art preference elicitation methods. Moreover, solving the right optimization task, SPQ shows better performance than baselines with dynamically generated questions.</p>

    <h3>Personalizing Session-based Recommendations with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Cremonesi, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Balázs Hidasi, Massimo Quadrana</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendations are an important problem in many recommendation settings (e.g. e-commerce). Recurrent Neural Networks have recently been shown to perform very well in this setting. While in many session-based recommendation domains user identifiers are hard to come by there are also settings in which these profiles are readily available. We propose a seamless way to personalize RNN models with cross-session information and devise a hierarchical RNN model that transfers end evolves the hidden states of the RNN’s across user sessions. Results on two industry datasets show large improvements over the session-only RNN’s.</p>

    <h3>Powering Content Discovery through Scalable, Realtime Profiling of Users’ Content Preferences (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roy Bass, Baruch Brutman, Yoram Dayagi, Ido Tamir, Guy Kobrinsky, Ronny Lempel</p>
    <p>Outbrain is the Web’s leading content discovery service, recommending billions of stories daily to a global audience across many of the world’s most prestigious and respected publishers. Outbrain’s recommendation technology combines contextual cues with personalization, where the personalization aspects are a combination of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. This paper, and the accompanying demo of a production system, offer a behind-the-scenes view of the content-based aspects of Outbrain’s personalization technology. We detail the types of features we extract from content, as well as the attributes we keep in each user’s content-affinity profile. We then describe and demonstrate how we update each user’s profile, in real time, as the user consumes content while browsing the Web.</p>

    <h3>Content Driven User Profiling for Comment-Worthy Recommendations of News and Blog Articles (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mrinal Das, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Trapit Bansal</p>
    <p>We consider the problem of recommending articles such as news and blog-posts. An article is defined to be comment-worthy for a particular user if that user is interested to leave a comment on it. We note that recommending comment-worthy articles calls for elicitation of of the user from the of both the articles and the past comments made by users. We thus propose to develop user profiles to elicit these latent interests of users in commenting and use them to recommend articles for future commenting. The difficulty of modeling comment content and the varied nature of users’ commenting interests make the problem technically challenging. The problem of recommending comment-worthy articles is resolved by leveraging article and comment content through topic modeling and the co-commenting pattern of users through collaborative filtering, combined within a novel hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach. Our solution, Collaborative Correspondence Topic Models (CCTM), generates user profiles which are leveraged to provide a personalized ranking of articles for each user. Through these -driven user profiles, CCTM effectively handle the ubiquitous problem of without relying on additional meta-data. The inference problem for the model is intractable with no off-the-shelf solution and we develop an efficient Monte Carlo EM algorithm. CCTM is evaluated on three real world data-sets, crawled from two , ArsTechnica (AT) Gadgets (102,087 comments) and AT-Science (71,640 comments), and a site, DailyMail (33,500 comments). We show average improvement of 14% (warm-start) and 18% (cold-start) in AUC, and 80% (warm-start) and 250% (cold-start) in Hit-Rank@5, over state of the art.</p>

    <h3>Do you have a Pop face? Here is a Pop song. Using profile pictures to mitigate the cold-start problem in Music Recommender Systems. (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugenio Tacchini, Ramon Morros, Enrique Sañoso, Veronica Vilaplana</p>
    <p>When a new user registers to a recommender system service, the system does not know her taste and cannot propose meaningful suggestions (cold-start problem). This preliminary work attempts to mitigate the cold-start problem using the profile picture of the user as a sole information, following the intuition that a correspondence may exist between the pictures that people use to represent themselves and their taste. We proved that, at least in the small music community we used for our experiments, our method can improve the precision of both a classifier and a Top-N music recommender system in a cold-start condition.</p>

    <h3>Eliciting the Users’ Unknown Preferences (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Neidhardt, Hannes Werthner, Leonhard Seyfang, Rainer Schuster</p>
    <p>Personalized recommendation strongly relies on an accurate model to capture user preferences; eliciting this information is, in general, a hard problem. In the field of tourism this initial profiling becomes even more challenging. It has been shown that particularly in the beginning of the travel decision making process, users themselves are often not conscious of their needs and are not able to express them. In this paper, the basics of a picture-based approach are introduced that aims at revealing implicitly given user preferences. Based on a set of travel related pictures selected by a user, an individual travel profile is deduced. This is accomplished by mapping those pictures onto seven basic factors that reflect different travel behavioral aspects. Also tourism products can be represented by this simple seven factor model. Thus, this model constitutes the basis of our recommendation algorithm. In addition, users experience this non-verbal way of interaction as exiting and inspiring.</p>
