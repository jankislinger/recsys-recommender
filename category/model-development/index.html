    <h3>Towards Source-Aligned Variational Models for Cross-Domain Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aghiles Salah, Hady Lauw, Thanh Binh Tran</p>
    <p>Data sparsity is a long-standing challenge in recommender systems. Among existing approaches to alleviate this problem, cross-domain recommendation consists in leveraging knowledge from a source domain or category (e.g., Movies) to improve item recommendation in a target domain (e.g., Books). In this work, we advocate a probabilistic approach to cross-domain recommendation and rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) as our latent variable models. More precisely, we assume that we have access to a VAE trained on the source domain that we seek to leverage to improve preference modeling in the target domain. To this end, we propose a model which learns to fit the target observations and align its hidden space with the source latent space jointly. Since we model the latent spaces by the variational posteriors, we operate at this level, and in particular, we investigate two approaches, namely rigid and soft alignments. In the former scenario, the variational model in the target domain is set equal to the source variational model. That is, we only learn a generative model in the target domain. In the soft-alignment scenario, the target VAE has its variational model, but which is encouraged to look like its source counterpart. We analyze the proposed objectives theoretically and conduct extensive experiments to illustrate the benefit of our contribution. Empirical results on six real-world datasets show that the proposed models outperform several comparable cross-domain recommendation models.</p>

    <h3>Information Interactions in Outcome Prediction: Quantification and Interpretation using Stochastic Block Models (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaël Poux-Médard, Sabine Loudcher, Julien Velcin</p>
    <p>In most real-world applications, it is seldom the case that a result appears independently from an environment. In social networks, users’ behavior results from the people they interact with, news in their feed, or trending topics. In natural language, the meaning of phrases emerges from the combination of words. In general medicine, a diagnosis is established on the basis of the interaction of symptoms. Here, we propose the Interacting Mixed Membership Stochastic Block Model (IMMSBM), which investigates the role of interactions between entities (hashtags, words, memes, etc.) and quantifies their importance within the aforementioned corpora. We find that in inference tasks, taking them into account leads to average relative changes with respect to non-interacting models of up to 150% in the probability of an outcome and greatly improves the predictions performances. Furthermore, their role greatly improves the predictive power of the model. Our findings suggest that neglecting interactions when modeling real-world phenomena might lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn.</p>

    <h3>Data Quality Matters in Recommender Systems (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shlomo Berkovsky, Royi Ronen, Amir Amihood, Oren Sar Shalom, Elad Ziklik</p>
    <p>Although data quality has been recognized as an important factor in the broad information systems research, it has received little attention in recommender systems. Data quality matters are typically addressed in recommenders by ad-hoc cleansing methods, which prune noisy or unreliable records from the data. However, the setting of the cleansing parameters is often done arbitrarily, without thorough consideration of the data characteristics. In this work, we turn to two central data quality problems in recommender systems: sparsity and redundancy. We devise models for setting data-dependent thresholds and sampling levels, and evaluate these using a collection of public and proprietary datasets. We observe that the models accurately predict data cleansing parameters, while having minor effect on the accuracy of the generated recommendations.</p>
