    <h3>Recommendation of High Quality Representative Reviews in e-commerce (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chetan Kalyan, Sudeshna Sarkar, Muthusamy Chelliah, Debanjan Paul, Prajit Prashant Sinai Nadkarni</p>
    <p>Users of ecommerce portals commonly use customer reviews for making purchase decisions. Many products contain tens or hundreds of reviews which makes it impossible for the customer to read all of them in order to get a good idea about the product. A review recommendation system that can recommend a subset of the reviews is thus useful for e-commerce websites. However customer reviews are of varied quality and different reviews cover different aspects or issues about the product. We follow previous work that maintain the statistical distribution of product aspects along with their associated sentiments of the entire review set for that particular product. However we address the challenge which arises due to the fact that similar aspects are mentioned in different reviews using different natural language expressions (e.g. camera, photo and picture refers to the same product aspect of camera). We use vector representations to identify mentions of similar aspects and group them together under single product aspect. Review helpfulness score may act as a proxy for quality of reviews, but this approach suffers from cold start problem as new reviews do not have any helpfulness score. We measure the quality of the review based on its content by doing supervised training using a convolutional neural network. Though  our neural network model is trained with reviews from Amazon dataset which have helpfulness score, our model can be used to predict the quality score of new reviews which do not have any helpfulness score. The recommended subset of reviews have high content score and the coverage of the product aspects, issues and sentiments are representative of the entire review set. The system is evaluated on datasets from Amazon and is found to be more useful than the competing methods.</p>
