    <h3>When Fairness meets Bias: a Debiased Framework for Fairness aware Top-N Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Gong, Jingsen Zhang, Jiakai Tang, Xu Chen, Shiqi Shen, Zhipeng Wang</p>
    <p>Fairness in the recommendation domain has recently attracted increasing attention due to the more and more concerns on the algorithm discrimination and ethics. While recent years have witnessed many promising fairness aware recommender models, an important problem has been largely ignored, that is, the fairness can be biased due to the user personalized selection tendencies or the non-uniform item exposure probabilities. To study this problem, in this paper, we formally define a novel task named as unbiased fairness aware Top-N recommendation. For solving this task, we firstly define an ideal loss function based on all the user-item pairs. Considering that, in real-world datasets, only a small number of user-item interactions can be observed, we then approximate the above ideal loss with a more tractable objective based on the inverse propensity score (IPS). Since the recommendation datasets can be noisy and quite sparse, which brings difficulties for accurately estimating the IPS, we propose to optimize the objective in an IPS range instead of a specific point, which improve the model fault tolerance capability. In order to make our model more applicable to the commonly studied Top-N recommendation, we soften the ranking metrics such as Precision, Hit-Ratio and NDCG to derive an fully differentiable framework. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model based on four real-world datasets.</p>

    <h3>Personalized Diffusions for Top-N Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitris Berberidis, George Karypis, Georgios B. Giannakis, Athanasios N. Nikolakopoulos</p>
    <p>This paper introduces PERDIF; a novel framework for learning personalized diffusions over item-to-item graphs for top-n recommendation. PERDIF learns the teleportation probabilities of a time-inhomogeneous random walk with restarts capturing a user-specific underlying item exploration process. Such an approach can lead to significant improvements in recommendation accuracy, while also providing useful information about the users in the system. Per-user fitting can be performed in parallel and very efficiently even in large-scale settings. A comprehensive set of experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the scalability as well as the qualitative merits of the proposed framework. PERDIF achieves high recommendation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art competing approaches—including several recently proposed methods relying on deep neural networks.</p>

    <h3>entity2rec: Learning User-Item Relatedness from Knowledge Graphs for Top-N Item Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphaël Troncy, Enrico Palumbo, Giuseppe Rizzo</p>
    <p>Knowledge Graphs have proven to be extremely valuable to recommender systems, as they enable hybrid graph-based recommendation models encompassing both collaborative and content information. Leveraging this wealth of heterogeneous information for top-N item recommendation is a challenging task, as it requires the ability of effectively encoding a diversity of semantic relations and connectivity patterns. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning user-item relatedness from knowledge graphs for top-N item recommendations. We start from a knowledge graph modeling user-item and item-item relations and we learn property-specific vector representations of users and items applying neural language models on the network. These representations are used to create property-specific user-item relatedness features, which are in turn fed into learning to rank algorithms to learn a global relatedness model that optimizes top-N item recommendations. We evaluate the proposed approach in terms of ranking quality on the MovieLens 1M dataset, outperforming two state-of-the-art recommender systems, and we assess the importance of property-specific relatedness scores on the overall ranking quality.</p>

    <h3>Top-N Recommendation with Missing Implicit Feedback (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gert Lanckriet, Daryl Lim, Julian McAuley</p>
    <p>In implicit feedback datasets, non-interaction of a user with an item does not necessarily indicate that an item is irrelevant for the user. Thus, evaluation measures computed on the observed feedback may not accurately reflect performance on the complete data. In this paper, we discuss a missing data model for implicit feedback and propose a novel evaluation measure oriented towards Top-N recommendation. Our evaluation measure admits unbiased estimation under our missing data model, unlike the popular Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) measure. We also derive an efficient algorithm to optimize the measure on the training data. We run several experiments which demonstrate the utility of our proposed measure.</p>

    <h3>Convex AUC Optimization for Top-N Recommendation with Implicit Feedback (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabio Aiolli</p>
    <p>In this paper, an effective collaborative filtering algorithm for top-N item recommendation with implicit feedback is proposed. The task of top-N item recommendation is to predict a ranking of items (movies, books, songs, or products in general) that can be interesting for a given user based on earlier preferences of the user. In this paper we focus on implicit feedback where these preferences are given in the form of binary events/ratings. Differently from state-of-the-art methods our proposed method is designed to optimize the obtained AUC directly within a margin maximization paradigm. In particular, the solution consists of a simple constrained quadratic optimization problem, one for each user. The experiments performed on several benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art matrix factorization methods in terms of AUC of the obtained predictions.</p>
