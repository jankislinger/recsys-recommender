    <h3>Pairwise Intent Graph Embedding Learning for Context-Aware Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhao Wu, Zhong Ming, Xiaolian Zhang, Hao Wang, Qinjuan Yang, Dugang Liu, Weixin Li</p>
    <p>Although knowledge graph have shown their effectiveness in mitigating data sparsity in many recommendation tasks, they remain underutilized in context-aware recommender systems (CARS) with the specific sparsity challenges associated with the contextual features, i.e., feature sparsity and interaction sparsity. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel pairwise intent graph embedding learning (PING) framework to efficiently integrate knowledge graph into CARS. Specifically, our PING contains three modules: 1) a graph construction module is used to obtain a pairwise intent graph (PIG) containing nodes for users, items, entities and enhanced intent, where enhanced intent nodes are generated by applying user intent fusion (UIF) on relational intent and contextual intent, and two sub-intents are derived from the semantic information and contextual information, respectively; 2) a pairwise intent joint graph convolution module is used to obtain the refined embeddings of all the features by executing a customized convolution strategy on PIG, where each enhanced intent node acts as a hub to efficiently propagate information among different features and between all the features and knowledge graph; 3) a recommendation module with the refined embeddings is used to replace the randomly initialized embeddings of downstream recommendation models to improve model performance. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to verify the effectiveness and compatibility of our PING.</p>

    <h3>Exploring the Impact of Temporal Bias in Point-of-Interest Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Tourani, Hossein A. Rahmani, Yashar Deldjoo, Mohammadmehdi Naghiaei</p>
    <p>Recommending appropriate travel destinations to consumers based on contextual information such as their check-in time and location is a primary objective of Point-of-Interest (POI) recommender systems. However, the issue of contextual bias (i.e., how much consumers prefer one situation over another) has received little attention from the research community. This paper examines the effect of temporal bias, defined as the difference between users’ check-in hours, leisure vs. work hours, on the consumer-side fairness of context-aware recommendation algorithms. We believe that eliminating this type of temporal (and geographical) bias might contribute to a drop in traffic-related air pollution, noting that rush-hour traffic may be more congested. To surface effective POI recommendation, we evaluated the sensitivity of state-of-the-art context-aware models to the temporal bias contained in users’ check-in activities on two POI datasets, namely Gowalla and Yelp. The findings show that the examined context-aware recommendation models prefer one group of users over another based on the time of check-in and that this preference persists even when users have the same amount of interactions.</p>

    <h3>TAPER: A Contextual Tensor-Based Approach for Personalized Expert Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hancheng Ge, Haokai Lu, James Caverlee</p>
    <p>We address the challenge of personalized recommendation of high quality content producers in social media. While some candidates are easily identifiable (say, by being “favorited” many times), there is a long-tail of potential candidates for whom we have little evidence. Through careful modeling of contextual factors like the geo-spatial, topical, and social preferences of users, we propose a tensor-based personalized expert recommendation framework that integrates these factors for revealing latent connections between homogeneous entities (e.g., users and users) and between heterogeneous entities (e.g., users and experts). Through extensive experiments over geo-tagged Twitter data, we find that the proposed framework can improve the quality of recommendation by over 30% in both precision and recall compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>
