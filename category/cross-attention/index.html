    <h3>Context and Attribute-Aware Sequential Recommendation via Cross-Attention (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Rashed, Lars Schmidt-Thieme, Shereen Elsayed</p>
    <p>In sparse recommender settings, users’ context and item attributes play a crucial role in deciding which items to recommend next. Despite that, recent works in sequential and time-aware recommendations usually either ignore both aspects or only consider one of them, limiting their predictive performance. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a context and attribute-aware recommender model (CARCA) that can capture the dynamic nature of the user profiles in terms of contextual features and item attributes via dedicated multi-head self-attention blocks that extract profile-level features and predict item scores. Also, unlike many of the current state-of-the-art sequential item recommendation approaches that use a simple dot-product between the most recent item’s latent features and the target items embeddings for scoring, CARCA uses cross-attention between all profile items and the target items to predict their final scores. This cross-attention allows CARCA to harness the correlation between old and recent items in the user profile and their influence on deciding which item to recommend next. Experiments on four real-world recommender system datasets show that the proposed model significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art models in the task of item recommendation and achieving improvements of up to 53% in Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and Hit-Ratio. Results also show that CARCA outperformed several state-of-the-art dedicated image-based recommender systems by merely utilizing image attributes extracted from a pre-trained ResNet50 in a black-box fashion.</p>

    <h3>Tops, Bottoms, and Shoes: Building Capsule Wardrobes via Cross-Attention Tensor Network (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Yang, Fei Wang, Yusan Lin, Huiyuan Chen</p>
    <p>Fashion is more than Paris runways. Fashion is about how people express their interests, identity, mood, and cultural influences. Given an inventory of candidate garments from different categories, how to assemble them together would most improve their fashionability? This question presents an intriguing visual recommendation challenge to automatically create capsule wardrobes. Capsule wardrobe generation is a complex combinatorial problem that requires the understanding of how multiple visual items interact. The generative process often needs fashion experts to manually tease the combinations out, making it hard to scale.<br>We introduce TensorNet, an approach that captures the key ingredients of visual compatibility among tops, bottoms, and shoes. TensorNet aims to provide actionable advice for full-body clothing outfits that mix and match well. Our TensorNet consists of two core modules: a Cross-Attention Message Passing module and a Wide&Deep Tensor Interaction module. As such, TensorNet is able to characterize the local region-based patterns as well as the global compatibility of the entire outfits. Our experimental results on the real-word datasets indicate that the proposed method is capable of learning visual compatibility and outperforms all the baselines. TensorNet opens up opportunities for fashion designers to narrow down the search space for multi-clothes combinations.</p>
