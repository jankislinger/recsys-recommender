    <h3>Leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search for Group Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Andres Diaz-Pace, Antonela Tommasel</p>
    <p>Group recommenders aim to provide recommendations that satisfy the collective preferences of multiple users, a challenging task due to the diverse individual tastes and conflicting interests to be balanced. This is often accomplished by using aggregation techniques that select items on which the group can agree. Traditional aggregators struggle with these complexities, as items are chosen independently, leading to sub-optimal recommendations lacking diversity, novelty, or fairness. In this paper, we propose an aggregation technique that leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance group recommendations. MCTS is used to explore and evaluate candidate recommendation sequences to optimize overall group satisfaction. We also investigate the integration of MCTS with LLMs aiming at better understanding interactions between user preferences and recommendation sequences to inform the search. Experimental evaluations, although preliminary, showed that our proposal outperforms existing aggregation techniques in terms of relevance and beyond-accuracy aspects of recommendations. The LLM integration achieved positive results for recommendations’ relevance. Overall, this work highlights the potential of heuristic search techniques to tackle the complexities of group recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Demystifying Recommender Systems: A Multi-faceted Examination of Explanation Generation, Impact, and Perception (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Balloccu</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have become an integral component of the digital landscape, impacting a multitude of services and industries ranging from e-commerce to entertainment and beyond. By offering personalised suggestions, these systems challenge a fundamental problem in our modern information society named information overload. As users face a deluge of choices, recommender systems help sift through this immense sea of possibilities, delivering a personalised subset of options that align with user preferences and historical behaviour. However, despite their considerable utility, recommender systems often operate as “black boxes,” obscuring the rationale behind recommendations. This opacity can engender mistrust and undermine user engagement, thus attenuating the overall effectiveness of the system. Researchers have emphasized the importance of explanations in recommender systems, highlighting how explanations can enhance system transparency, foster user trust, and improve decision-making processes, thereby enriching user experiences and yielding potential business benefits. Yet, a significant gap persists in the current state of human-understandable explanations research. While recommender systems have grown increasingly complex, our capacity to generate clear, concise, and relevant explanations that reflect this complexity remains limited. Crafting explanations that are both understandable and reflective of sophisticated algorithmic decision-making processes poses a significant challenge, especially in a manner that meets the user’s cognitive and contextual needs.</p>

    <h3>Timely Personalization at Peloton: A System and Algorithm for Boosting Time-Relevant Content (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnab Bhadury, Shayak Banerjee, Vijay Pappu, Nilothpal Talukder, Jasmine Paulino, Shoya Yoshida, Allison Schloss</p>
    <p>At Peloton, we are challenged to not just surface relevant recommendations of fitness classes to our members, but also timely ones. As our fitness content library expands, we continually produce classes on certain themes which are most timely during a narrow time window. To address this challenge, we provide some control over our recommendations to external stakeholders, such as production and marketing teams. They enter timed boosts of certain classes during the windows they are relevant in. We have built out algorithms which take these desired classes and elevate the number of impressions for them, while preserving members’ engagement with our recommendations. In this paper, we discuss the system, the algorithms and some results from a few A/B tests showing how boosting works in practice.</p>

    <h3>Query as Context for Item-to-Item Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moumita Bhattacharya</p>
    <p>Recommender Systems is one of the main machine learning applications for an e-commerce platforms such as Etsy, a two sided marketplace. A frequent usage of such system is for item-to-item recommendations that show similar items (also referred as listings) based on the listing a user is currently viewing. Item-to-item recommendations typically take into account information that are only associated with the target listing and other listings in the inventory. However, other contextual information such as user intents, queries and seasonality, are often not taken into account. In this talk, we will present two approaches we developed to utilize additional contextual information in the form of queries in generating item-to-item recommendations. Moreover, we will present our journey in migrating Etsy’s rankers from linear to non-linear models. Additionally, we propose new metrics to evaluate candidate sets that accesses diversity and price spread, while not compromising relevance. The proposed metrics can also be used beyond the current application. Our proposed candidate set generation approach outperforms the model in production as well as yielding significant lift in conversion rate and other engagement metrics as indicated by several A/B tests.</p>

    <h3>Do Channels Matter?: Illuminating Interpersonal Influence on Music Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minju Park, So Yeon Park, Kyogu Lee, Hyun Jeong Kim</p>
    <p>Researchers and service providers have focused on leveraging social information acquired from interactions between users to improve the accuracy of system recommendations. However, few have explained the characteristics of music recommendations through interpersonal relationships. To investigate how interpersonal relationships affect users’ evaluation of music recommendation, we conducted a survey-based study that compared two types of recommendation channels—interpersonal (i.e., from friends) and non-interpersonal (i.e., from systems). We found that relevance was evaluated higher in music recommended from non-interpersonal channels on average, while diversity, novelty, and serendipity were higher in interpersonal channels. Non-interpersonal channels surpassed interpersonal channels in terms of convenience, frequency, and adoption rate. These results illustrate that interpersonal and non-interpersonal channels have different strengths and that digital streaming platforms, which have mainly provided system recommendations thus far, need to better support interpersonal channels for richer user experience.</p>

    <h3>A Robust Model for Paper-Reviewer Assignment (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Liu, Nasir Memon, Torsten Suel</p>
    <p>Automatic expert assignment is a common problem encountered in both industry and academia. For example, for conference program chairs and journal editors, in order to collect “good” judgments for a paper, it is necessary for them to assign the paper to the most appropriate reviewers. Choosing appropriate reviewers of course includes a number of considerations such as expertise and authority, but also diversity and avoiding conflicts. In this paper, we explore the expert retrieval problem and implement an automatic paper-reviewer recommendation system that considers aspects of expertise, authority, and diversity. In particular, a graph is first constructed on the possible reviewers and the query paper, incorporating expertise and authority information. Then a Random Walk with Restart (RWR) model is employed on the graph with a sparsity constraint, incorporating diversity information. Extensive experiments on two reviewer recommendation benchmark datasets show that the proposed method obtains performance gains over the state-of-the-art reviewer recommendation systems in terms of expertise, authority, diversity, and, most importantly, relevance as judged by human experts.</p>
