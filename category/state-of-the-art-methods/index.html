    <h3>Dynamic Stage-aware User Interest Learning for Heterogeneous Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhong Ming, Weixin Li, Xiaolin Lin, Weike Pan</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation has been widely used to predict users’ potential preferences by learning their dynamic user interests, for which most previous works focus on capturing item-level dependencies. Despite the great success, they often overlook the stage-level interest dependencies. In real-world scenarios, user interests tend to be staged, e.g., following an item purchase, a user’s interests may undergo a transition into the subsequent phase. And there are intricate dependencies across different stages. Meanwhile, users’ behaviors are usually heterogeneous, including auxiliary behaviors (e.g., examinations) and target behaviors (e.g., purchases), which imply more fine-grained user interests. However, existing works have limitations in explicitly modeling the relationships between auxiliary behaviors and target behaviors. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework, i.e., dynamic stage-aware user interest learning (DSUIL), for heterogeneous sequential recommendation, which is the first solution to model user interests in a cross-stage manner. Specifically, our DSUIL consists of three modules: a dynamic graph convolution module that dynamically learns item representations in each stage, a behavior-aware subgraph representation learning module that learns heterogeneous dependencies between behaviors and aggregates item representations to represent the user interests for each stage, and a sequence decoder to capture the evolving pattern of user interests and make item prediction. Extensive experimental results on two public datasets show that our DSUIL performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>Towards Open-World Recommendation with Knowledge Augmentation from Large Language Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiwen Liu, Bo Chen, Yong Yu, Hong Zhu, Yunjia Xi, Weinan Zhang, Jianghao Lin, Xiaoling Cai, Jieming Zhu, Ruiming Tang</p>
    <p>Recommender system plays a vital role in various online services. However, its insulated nature of training and deploying separately within a specific closed domain limits its access to open-world knowledge. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in bridging this gap by encoding extensive world knowledge and demonstrating reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, previous attempts to directly use LLMs as recommenders cannot meet the inference latency demand of industrial recommender systems. In this work, we propose an Open-World Knowledge Augmented Recommendation Framework with Large Language Models, dubbed KAR, to acquire two types of external knowledge from LLMs — the reasoning knowledge on user preferences and the factual knowledge on items. We introduce factorization prompting to elicit accurate reasoning on user preferences. The generated reasoning and factual knowledge are effectively transformed and condensed into augmented vectors by a hybrid-expert adaptor in order to be compatible with the recommendation task. The obtained vectors can then be directly used to enhance the performance of any recommendation model. We also ensure efficient inference by preprocessing and prestoring the knowledge from the LLM. Extensive experiments show that KAR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and is compatible with a wide range of recommendation algorithms. We deploy KAR to Huawei’s news and music recommendation platforms and gain a 7% and 1.7% improvement in the online A/B test, respectively.</p>

    <h3>Revisiting BPR: A Replicability Study of a Common Recommender System Baseline (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandr Milogradskii, Oleg Lashinin, Sergey Kolesnikov, Alexander P, Marina Ananyeva</p>
    <p>Bayesian Personalized Rank (BPR), a collaborative filtering approach based on matrix factorization, frequently serves as a benchmark for recommender systems research. However, numerous studies often overlook the nuances of BPR implementation, claiming that it performs worse than newly proposed methods across various tasks. In this paper, we thoroughly examine the features of the BPR model, indicating their impact on its performance, and investigate open-source BPR implementations. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies between these implementations and the original BPR paper, leading to a significant decrease in performance of up to 50% for specific implementations. Furthermore, through extensive experiments on real-world datasets under modern evaluation settings, we demonstrate that with proper tuning of its hyperparameters, the BPR model can achieve performance levels close to state-of-the-art methods on the top-n recommendation tasks and even outperform them on specific datasets. Specifically, on the Million Song Dataset, the BPR model with hyperparameters tuning statistically significantly outperforms Mult-VAE by 10% in NDCG@100 with binary relevance function.</p>

    <h3>Translation-based Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruining He, Julian McAuley, Wang-Cheng Kang</p>
    <p>Modeling the complex interactions between users and items as well as amongst items themselves is at the core of designing successful recommender systems. One classical setting is predicting users’ personalized sequential behavior (or ‘next-item’ recommendation), where the challenges mainly lie in modeling ‘third-order’ interactions between a user, her previously visited item(s), and the next item to consume. Existing methods typically decompose these higher-order interactions into a combination pairwise relationships, by way of which user preferences (user-item interactions) and sequential patterns (item-item interactions) are captured by separate components. In this paper, we propose a unified method, TransRec, to model such third-order relationships for large-scale sequential prediction. Methodologically, we embed items into a ‘transition space’ where users are modeled as translation vectors operating on item sequences. Empirically, this approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on a wide spectrum of real-world datasets.</p>

    <h3>A Coverage-Based Approach to Recommendation Diversity On Similarity Graph (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Usunier, Shameem A Puthiya Parambath, Yves Grandvalet</p>
    <p>We consider the problem of generating diverse, personalized recommendations such that a small set of recommended items covers a broad range of the user’s interests. We represent items in a similarity graph, and we formulate the relevance/diversity trade-off as finding a small set of unrated items that best covers a subset of items positively rated by the user. In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not rely on an explicit trade-off between a relevance objective and a diversity objective, as the estimations of relevance and diversity are implicit in the coverage criterion. We show on several benchmark datasets that our approach compares favorably to the state-of-the-art diversification methods according to various relevance and diversity measures.</p>
