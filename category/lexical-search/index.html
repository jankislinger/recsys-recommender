    <h3>LyricLure: Mining Catchy Hooks in Song Lyrics to Enhance Music Discovery and Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tarun Sharma, Siddharth Sharma, Joaquin Delgado, Ajinkya Walimbe, Akshay Shukla</p>
    <p>Amazon Music encounters a significant challenge as users increasingly rely on catchy lines from lyrics to search for both new releases and other popular songs. Integrating lyrics into existing lexical search index or using lyrics vector index pose difficulties due to lyrics text length. While lexical scoring mechanisms like BM25 are inadequate and necessitates complex query planning and index schema for long text, text embedding similarity based techniques often retrieve noisy near-similar meaning lyrics, resulting in low precision. This paper introduces a proactive approach to extract catchy phrases from song lyrics, overcoming the limitations of conventional graph-based phrase extractors and deep learning models, which are primarily designed for extractive summarization or task-specific key phrase extraction from domain-specific corpora. Additionally, we employ a multi-step mechanism to mine search query logs for potential unresolved user queries containing catchy phrases from lyrics. This involves creation of word and character k-gram index for lyric chunks, careful query and lyrics domain-centric normalization (and expansion) and a re-ranking layer incorporating lexical and well as semantic similarity. Together these strategies helped us create a high retrieval source specifically for serving lyrics intent queries with high recall.</p>

    <h3>Re2Dan: Retrieval of medical documents for e-Health in Danish (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafael Pablos, Ira Assent, Antonela Tommasel</p>
    <p>With the clinical environment becoming more data-reliant, healthcare professionals now have unparalleled access to comprehensive clinical information from numerous sources. Then, one of the main issues is how to avoid overloading practitioners with large amounts of (irrelevant) information while guiding them to the relevant documents for specific patient cases. Additional challenges appear due to the shortness of queries and the presence of long (and maybe noisy) contextual information. This demo presents Re2Dan, a web Retrieval and recommender of Danish medical documents. Re2Dan leverages several techniques to improve the quality of retrieved documents. First, it combines lexical and semantic searches to understand the meaning and context of user queries, allowing the retrieval of documents that are conceptually similar to the user’s query. Second, it recommends similar queries, allowing users to discover related documents and insights. Third, when given contextual information (e.g., from patients’ clinical notes), it suggests medical concepts to expand the user query, enabling a more focused search scope and thus obtaining more accurate recommendations. Preliminary analyses showed the effectiveness of the recommender in improving the relevance and comprehensiveness of recommendations, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in finding relevant information for informed decision-making.</p>
