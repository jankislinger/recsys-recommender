    <h3>Encouraging Exploration in Spotify Search through Query Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henrik Lindstrom, Humberto Jesús Corona Pampín, Alva Liu, Enrico Palumbo</p>
    <p>At Spotify, search has been traditionally seen as a tool for retrieving content, with the search system optimized for when the user has a specific search target in mind. In particular we have relied on an instant search system providing results for each keystroke, which works well for known-item search, when queries are straightforward, and the catalog is small. However, as Spotify’s catalog grows in size and variety, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to define their search intents accurately. Furthermore, as we expand the offering, we need to help users discover more content both when it comes to new content types, e.g. audiobooks, as well as for new content/creators within existing content types. To solve this we have introduced a hybrid Query Recommendation system (QR) that helps the user formulate more complex exploratory search intents, while still serving known-item lookups efficiently. This experience has been rolled out worldwide to all mobile users resulting in an increase in exploratory intent queries of ~9% in online A/B tests.</p>

    <h3>Optimizing Podcast Discovery: Unveiling Amazon Music’s Retrieval and Ranking Framework (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Greyson, Geetha Aluri, Joaquin Delgado</p>
    <p>This work presents the search architecture of Amazon Music, which is a highly efficient system designed to retrieve relevant content for users. The architecture consists of three key stages: indexing, retrieval, and ranking. During the indexing stage, data is meticulously parsed and processed to create a comprehensive index that contains dense representations and essential information about each document (such as a music or podcast entity) in the collection, including its title, metadata, and relevant attributes. This indexing process enables fast and efficient data access during retrieval. The retrieval stage utilizes multi-faceted retrieval strategies, resulting in improved identification of candidate matches compared to traditional structured search methods. Subsequently, candidates are ranked based on their relevance to the customer’s query, taking into account document features and personalized factors. With a specific focus on the podcast use case, this paper highlights the deployment of the architecture and demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing podcast search capabilities, providing tailored and engaging content experiences.</p>

    <h3>Recommendations and Results Organization in Netflix Search (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudarshan Lamkhede</p>
    <p>Personalized recommendations on the Netflix Homepage are based on a user’s viewing habits and the behavior of similar users. These recommendations, organized for efficient browsing, enable users to discover the next great video to watch and enjoy without additional input or an explicit expression of their intents or goals. The Netflix Search experience, on the other hand, allows users to take active control of discovering new videos by explicitly expressing their entertainment needs via search queries. In this talk, we discuss the importance of producing search results that go beyond traditional keyword-matches to effectively satisfy users’ search needs in the Netflix entertainment setting. Motivated by users’ various search intents, we highlight the necessity to improve Search by applying approaches that have historically powered the Homepage. Specifically, we discuss our approach to leverage recommendations in the context of Search and to effectively organize search results to provide a product experience that meaningfully adds value for our users.</p>

    <h3>Behavior-based Popularity Ranking on Amazon Video (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lakshmi Ramachandran</p>
    <p>With the growth in the number of video streaming services, providers have to strive hard to make relevant content available and keep customers engaged. A good experience would help customers discover new and popular videos to stream with ease. Customer streaming behavior tends to be a strong indicator of whether they found a video engaging. Aggregate customer behavior serves as a useful predictor of popularity. We discuss the use of past streaming behavior to learn patterns and predict a video’s popularity using tree ensembles.</p>

    <h3>Powering Content Discovery through Scalable, Realtime Profiling of Users’ Content Preferences (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roy Bass, Baruch Brutman, Yoram Dayagi, Ido Tamir, Guy Kobrinsky, Ronny Lempel</p>
    <p>Outbrain is the Web’s leading content discovery service, recommending billions of stories daily to a global audience across many of the world’s most prestigious and respected publishers. Outbrain’s recommendation technology combines contextual cues with personalization, where the personalization aspects are a combination of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. This paper, and the accompanying demo of a production system, offer a behind-the-scenes view of the content-based aspects of Outbrain’s personalization technology. We detail the types of features we extract from content, as well as the attributes we keep in each user’s content-affinity profile. We then describe and demonstrate how we update each user’s profile, in real time, as the user consumes content while browsing the Web.</p>
