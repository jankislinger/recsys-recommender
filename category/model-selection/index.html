    <h3>A Payload Optimization Method for Federated Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuan Eeik Tan, Zareen Alamgir, Muhammad Ammad-ud-din, Farwa K. Khan, Adrian Flanagan</p>
    <p>In this study, we introduce the payload optimization method for federated recommender systems (FRS). In federated learning (FL), the global model payload that is moved between the server and users depends on the number of items to recommend. The model payload grows when there is an increasing number of items. This becomes challenging for FRS if it is running in production mode. To tackle the payload challenge, we formulated a multi-arm bandit solution that selected part of the global model and transmitted it to all users. The selection process was guided by a novel reward function suitable for FL systems. So far as we are aware, this is the first optimization method that seeks to address item dependent payloads. The method was evaluated using three benchmark recommendation datasets. The empirical validation confirmed that the proposed method outperforms the simpler methods that do not benefit from the bandits for the purpose of item selection. In addition, we have demonstrated the usefulness of our proposed method by rigorously evaluating the effects of a payload reduction on the recommendation performance degradation. Our method achieved up to a 90% reduction in model payload, yielding only a ∼ 4% - 8% loss in the recommendation performance for highly sparse datasets.</p>

    <h3>Recommenders in banking: An end-to-end personalization pipeline within ING (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Santiago Gil-Begue</p>
    <p>Retail services in corporate international banks are often constrained by the compliance and infrastructure specificities of the countries in which they operate. In addition, the business model and customers interactions through a banking app differ greatly from other major retail services in sectors like digital streaming or e-commerce platforms. We introduce ING’s Bank retail recommender system, elaborating on how we account for the global vs. local requirements, and how can we benefit from such an approach for our model selection as well as products serving.</p>

    <h3>Practical Lessons from Developing a Large-Scale Recommender System at Zalando (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonino Freno</p>
    <p>Developing a real-world recommender system, i.e. for use in large-scale online retail, poses a number of different challenges. Interestingly, only a small part of these challenges are of algorithmic nature, such as how to select the most accurate model for a given use case. Instead, most technical problems usually arise from operational constraints, such as: adaptation to novel use cases; cost and complexity of system maintenance; capability of reusing pre-existing signal and integrating heterogeneous data sources. In this paper, we describe the system we developed in order to address those constraints at Zalando, which is one of the most popular online fashion retailers in Europe. In particular, we explain how moving from a collaborative filtering approach to a learning-to-rank model helped us to effectively tackle the challenges mentioned above, while improving at the same time the quality of our recommendations. A fairly detailed description of our software architecture is provided, along with an overview of the algorithmic approach. On the other hand, we present some of the offline and online experiments that we ran in order to validate our models.</p>

    <h3>Tip Ranker: A M.L. Approach to Ranking Short Reviews (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enrique Cruz, Berk Kapicioglu</p>
    <p>Foursquare is a local search and discovery app where as part of the experience users leave tips, short reviews and suggestions to help other users find great places. This poster summarizes the strategy we use to select the best tips for a given venue. Our new ranking model to select the tips that provide our users with the most informative and high quality content. The introduction of the new model yielded significant and positive results in our metrics from various applications within the Foursquare app ecosystem.</p>
