    <h3>A GPU-specialized Inference Parameter Server for Large-Scale Deep Recommendation Models (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingcan Wei, Fan Yu, Jie Liu, Ji Shi, Matthias Langer, Minseok Lee, Zehuan Wang</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems are of crucial importance for a variety of modern apps and web services, such as news feeds, social networks, e-commerce, search, etc. To achieve peak prediction accuracy, modern recommendation models combine deep learning with terabyte-scale embedding tables to obtain a fine-grained representation of the underlying data. Traditional inference serving architectures require deploying the whole model to standalone servers, which is infeasible at such massive scale.<br>In this paper, we provide insights into the intriguing and challenging inference domain of online recommendation systems. We propose the HugeCTR Hierarchical Parameter Server (HPS), an industry-leading distributed recommendation inference framework, that combines a high-performance GPU embedding cache with an hierarchical storage architecture, to realize low-latency retrieval of embeddings for online model inference tasks. Among other things, HPS features (1) a redundant hierarchical storage system, (2) a novel high-bandwidth cache to accelerate parallel embedding lookup on NVIDIA GPUs, (3) online training support and (4) light-weight APIs for easy integration into existing large-scale recommendation workflows. To demonstrate its capabilities, we conduct extensive studies using both synthetically engineered and public datasets. We show that our HPS can dramatically reduce end-to-end inference latency, achieving 5~62x speedup (depending on the batch size) over CPU baseline implementations for popular recommendation models. Through multi-GPU concurrent deployment, the HPS can also greatly increase the inference QPS.</p>

    <h3>Contextual and Sequential User Embeddings for Large-Scale Music Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Mehrotra, Christian Hansen, Casper Hansen, Brian Brost, Federico Tomasi, Lucas Maystre, Mounia Lalmas</p>
    <p>Recommender systems play an important role in providing an engaging experience on online music streaming services. However, the musical domain presents distinctive challenges to recommender systems: tracks are short, listened to multiple times, typically consumed in sessions with other tracks, and relevance is highly context-dependent. In this paper, we argue that modeling users’ preferences at the beginning of a session is a practical and effective way to address these challenges. Using a dataset from Spotify, a popular music streaming service, we observe that a) consumption from the recent past and b) session-level contextual variables (such as the time of the day or the type of device used) are indeed predictive of the tracks a user will stream—much more so than static, average preferences. Driven by these findings, we propose CoSeRNN, a neural network architecture that models users’ preferences as a sequence of embeddings, one for each session. CoSeRNN predicts, at the beginning of a session, a preference vector, based on past consumption history and current context. This preference vector can then be used in downstream tasks to generate contextually relevant just-in-time recommendations efficiently, by using approximate nearest-neighbour search algorithms. We evaluate CoSeRNN on session and track ranking tasks, and find that it outperforms the current state of the art by upwards of 10% on different ranking metrics. Dissecting the performance of our approach, we find that sequential and contextual information are both crucial.</p>
