    <h3>Multimodal Representation Learning for high-quality Recommendations in Cold-start and Beyond-Accuracy (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marta Moscati</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RS) traditionally leverage the large amount of user–item interaction data. This exposes RS to a lower recommendation quality in cold-start scenarios, as well as to a low recommendation quality in terms of beyond-accuracy evaluation metrics. State-of-the-art (SotA) models for cold-start scenarios rely on the use of side information on the items or the users, therefore relating recommendation to multimodal machine learning (ML). However, the most recent techniques from multimodal ML are often not applied to the domain of recommendation. Additionally, the evaluation of SotA multimodal RS often neglects beyond-accuracy aspects of recommendation. In this work, we outline research into designing novel multimodal RS based on SotA multimodal ML architectures for cold-start recommendation, and their evaluation and benchmark with preexisting multimodal RS in terms of accuracy and beyond-accuracy aspects of recommendation quality.</p>

    <h3>Distribution-based Learnable Filters with Side Information for Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Wang, Haibo Liu, Zhixiang Deng, Jinjia Peng, Shi Feng</p>
    <p>Sequential Recommendation aims to predict the next item by mining out the dynamic preference from user previous interactions. However, most methods represent each item as a single fixed vector, which is incapable of capturing the uncertainty of item-item transitions that result from time-dependent and multifarious interests of users. Besides, they fail to effectively exploit side information that helps to better express user preferences. At last, the noise in user’s access sequence, which is due to accidental clicks, can interfere with the next item prediction and lead to lower recommendation performance. To deal with these issues, we propose DLFS-Rec, a novel model that combines Distribution-based Learnable Filters with Side information for sequential Recommendation. Specifically, items and their side information are represented by stochastic Gaussian distribution, which is described by mean and covariance embeddings, and then the corresponding embeddings are fused to generate a final representation for each item. To attenuate noise, stacked learnable filter layers are applied to smooth the fused embeddings. The similarities between the distributions inferred from the last filter layer and candidates are measured by 2-Wasserstein distance for generating recommendation list. Extensive experiments on four public real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art baselines, especially on cold start users and items.</p>

    <h3>Transformers4Rec: Bridging the Gap between NLP and Sequential / Session-Based Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ronay Ak, Even Oldridge, Sara Rabhi, Gabriel de Souza Pereira Moreira, Jeong Min Lee</p>
    <p>Much of the recent progress in sequential and session-based recommendation has been driven by improvements in model architecture and pretraining techniques originating in the field of Natural Language Processing. Transformer architectures in particular have facilitated building higher-capacity models and provided data augmentation and training techniques which demonstrably improve the effectiveness of sequential recommendation. But with a thousandfold more research going on in NLP, the application of transformers for recommendation understandably lags behind. To remedy this we introduce Transformers4Rec, an open-source library built upon HuggingFace’s Transformers library with a similar goal of opening up the advances of NLP based Transformers to the recommender system community and making these advancements immediately accessible for the tasks of sequential and session-based recommendation. Like its core dependency, Transformers4Rec is designed to be extensible by researchers, simple for practitioners, and fast and robust in industrial deployments.<br>In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the library and the applicability of Transformer architectures in next-click prediction for user sessions, where sequence lengths are much shorter than those commonly found in NLP, we have leveraged Transformers4Rec to win two recent session-based recommendation competitions. In addition, we present in this paper the first comprehensive empirical analysis comparing many Transformer architectures and training approaches for the task of session-based recommendation. We demonstrate that the best Transformer architectures have superior performance across two e-commerce datasets while performing similarly to the baselines on two news datasets. We further evaluate in isolation the effectiveness of the different training techniques used in causal language modeling, masked language modeling, permutation language modeling and replacement token detection for a single Transformer architecture, XLNet. We establish that training XLNet with replacement token detection performs well across all datasets. Finally, we explore techniques to include side information such as item and user context features in order to establish best practices and show that the inclusion of side information uniformly improves recommendation performance.

    <h3>Cold Start Similar Artists Ranking with Gravity-Inspired Graph Autoencoders (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Romain Hennequin, Benjamin Chapus, Guillaume Salha-Galvan, Michalis Vazirgiannis, Viet-Anh Tran</p>
    <p>On an artist’s profile page, music streaming services frequently recommend a ranked list of ”similar artists” that fans also liked. However, implementing such a feature is challenging for new artists, for which usage data on the service (e.g. streams or likes) is not yet available. In this paper, we model this cold start similar artists ranking problem as a link prediction task in a directed and attributed graph, connecting artists to their top-k most similar neighbors and incorporating side musical information. Then, we leverage a graph autoencoder architecture to learn node embedding representations from this graph, and to automatically rank the top-k most similar neighbors of new artists using a gravity-inspired mechanism. We empirically show the flexibility and the effectiveness of our framework, by addressing a real-world cold start similar artists ranking problem on a global music streaming service. Along with this paper, we also publicly release our source code and the industrial data from our experiments.</p>

    <h3>Closed-Form Models for Collaborative Filtering with Side-Information (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Van Balen, Bart Goethals, Olivier Jeunen</p>
    <p>Recent work has shown that, despite their simplicity, item-based models optimised through ridge regression can attain highly competitive results on collaborative filtering tasks. As these models are analytically computable and thus forgo the need for often expensive iterative optimisation procedures, they are an attractive choice for practitioners. We study the applicability of such closed-form models to implicit-feedback collaborative filtering when additional side-information or metadata about items is available. Two complementary extensions to the easer paradigm are proposed, based on collective and additive models. Through an extensive empirical analysis on several large-scale datasets, we show that our methods can effectively exploit side-information whilst retaining a closed-form solution, and improve upon the state-of-the-art without increasing the computational complexity of the original easer approach. Additionally, empirical results demonstrate that the use of side-information leads to more “long tail” items being recommended, benefiting the recommendations’ coverage of the item catalogue.</p>

    <h3>Variational Low Rank Multinomials for Collaborative Filtering with Side-Information (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ehtsham Elahi, Dave Ray, Aish Fenton, Wei Wang, Tony Jebara</p>
    <p>We are interested in Bayesian models for collaborative filtering that incorporate side-information or metadata about items in addition to user-item interaction data. We present a simple and flexible framework to build models for this task that exploit the low-rank structure in user-item interaction datasets. Although the resulting models are non-conjugate, we develop an efficient technique for approximating posteriors over model parameters using variational inference. We borrow the ‘re-parameterization trick’ from Bayesian deep learning literature to enable variational inference in our models. The resulting approximate Bayesian inference algorithm is scalable and can handle large scale datasets. We demonstrate our ideas on three real world datasets where we show competitive performance against widely used baselines</p>

    <h3>Meta-Prod2Vec – Product Embeddings Using Side-Information for Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elena Smirnova, Alexis Conneau, Flavian Vasile</p>
    <p>We propose Meta-Prod2vec, a novel method to compute item similarities for recommendation that leverages existing item metadata. Such scenarios are frequently encountered in applications such as content recommendation, ad targeting and web search. Our method leverages past user interactions with items and their attributes to compute low-dimensional embeddings of items. Specifically, the item metadata is in- jected into the model as side information to regularize the item embeddings. We show that the new item representa- tions lead to better performance on recommendation tasks on an open music dataset.</p>

    <h3>Cold-Start Item and User Recommendation with Decoupled Completion and Transduction (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farzan Masrour, Iman Barjasteh, Abdol-Hossein Esfahanian, Hayder Radha, Rana Forsati</p>
    <p>A major challenge in collaborative filtering based recommender systems is how to provide recommendations when rating data is sparse or entirely missing for a subset of users or items, commonly known as the problem. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in developing new solutions that address the cold-start problem. These solutions are mainly based on the idea of exploiting other sources of information to compensate for the lack of rating data. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework based on matrix factorization that simultaneously exploits the similarity information among users and items to alleviate the cold-start problem. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed algorithm the following two aspects of the cold-start problem: (a) the completion of a rating sub-matrix, which is generated by excluding cold-start users and items from the original rating matrix; and (b) the transduction of knowledge from existing ratings to cold-start items/users using side information. This crucial difference significantly boosts the performance when appropriate side information is incorporated. We provide theoretical guarantees on the estimation error of the proposed two-stage algorithm based on the richness of similarity information in capturing the rating data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that addresses the cold-start problem with provable guarantees. We also conduct thorough experiments on synthetic and real datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and highlights the usefulness of auxiliary information in dealing with both cold-start users and items.</p>

    <h3>Social Collaborative Filtering for Cold-start Recommendations (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jordan Christensen, Scott Sanner, Lexing Xie, Darius Braziunas, Suvash Sedhain</p>
    <p>We examine the cold-start recommendation task in an online retail setting for users who have not yet purchased (or interacted in a meaningful way with) any available items but who have granted access to limited side information, such as basic demographic data (gender, age, location) or social network information (Facebook friends or page likes). We formalize neighborhood-based methods for cold-start collaborative filtering in a generalized matrix algebra framework that does not require purchase data for target users when their side information is available. In real-data experiments with 30,000 users who purchased 80,000+ books and had 9,000,000+ Facebook friends and 6,000,000+ page likes, we show that using Facebook page likes for cold-start recommendation yields up to a 3-fold improvement in mean average precision (mAP) and up to 6-fold improvements in Precision@k and Recall@k compared to most-popular-item, demographic, and Facebook friend cold-start recommenders. These results demonstrate the substantial predictive power of social network content, and its significant utility in a challenging problem – recommendation for cold-start users.</p>

    <h3>Modeling the Dynamics of User Preferences in Coupled Tensor Factorization (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandros Nanopoulos, Dimitrios Rafailidis</p>
    <p>In several applications, user preferences can be fairly dynamic, since users tend to exploit a wide range of items and modify their tastes accordingly over time. In this paper, we model continuous user-item interactions over time using a tensor that has time as a dimension (mode). To account for the fact that user preferences are dynamic and change individually, we propose a new measure of user-preference dynamics (UPD) that captures the rate with which the current preferences of each user have been shifted. We generate recommendations based on factorizing the tensor, by weighting the importance of past user preferences according to their UPD values. We additionally exploit users’ side data, such as demographics, which can help improving the accuracy of recommendations based on a coupled, tensor-matrix factorization scheme. Our empirical evaluation uses a real data set from last.fm, which allows us to demonstrate that user preferences can become very dynamic. Our experimental results show that the proposed method, by taking into account these dynamics, outperforms several baselines.</p>
