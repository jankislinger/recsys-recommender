    <h3>Optimizing Podcast Discovery: Unveiling Amazon Music’s Retrieval and Ranking Framework (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Greyson, Geetha Aluri, Joaquin Delgado</p>
    <p>This work presents the search architecture of Amazon Music, which is a highly efficient system designed to retrieve relevant content for users. The architecture consists of three key stages: indexing, retrieval, and ranking. During the indexing stage, data is meticulously parsed and processed to create a comprehensive index that contains dense representations and essential information about each document (such as a music or podcast entity) in the collection, including its title, metadata, and relevant attributes. This indexing process enables fast and efficient data access during retrieval. The retrieval stage utilizes multi-faceted retrieval strategies, resulting in improved identification of candidate matches compared to traditional structured search methods. Subsequently, candidates are ranked based on their relevance to the customer’s query, taking into account document features and personalized factors. With a specific focus on the podcast use case, this paper highlights the deployment of the architecture and demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing podcast search capabilities, providing tailored and engaging content experiences.</p>

    <h3>Identifying New Podcasts with High General Appeal Using a Pure Exploration Infinitely-Armed Bandit Strategy (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugues Bouchard, Javed Aslam, Kevin Jamieson, Maryam Aziz, Alice Y. Wang, Jesse Anderton</p>
    <p>Podcasting is an increasingly popular medium for entertainment and discourse around the world, with tens of thousands of new podcasts released on a monthly basis. We consider the problem of identifying from these newly-released podcasts those with the largest potential audiences so they can be considered for personalized recommendation to users. We first study and then discard a supervised approach due to the inadequacy of either content or consumption features for this task, and instead propose a novel non-contextual bandit algorithm in the fixed-budget infinitely-armed pure-exploration setting. We demonstrate that our algorithm is well-suited to the best-arm identification task for a broad class of arm reservoir distributions, out-competing a large number of state-of-the-art algorithms. We then apply the algorithm to identifying podcasts with broad appeal in a simulated study, and show that it efficiently sorts podcasts into groups by increasing appeal while avoiding the popularity bias inherent in supervised approaches.</p>
