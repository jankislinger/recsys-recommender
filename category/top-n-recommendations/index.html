    <h3>Revisiting BPR: A Replicability Study of a Common Recommender System Baseline (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandr Milogradskii, Oleg Lashinin, Sergey Kolesnikov, Alexander P, Marina Ananyeva</p>
    <p>Bayesian Personalized Rank (BPR), a collaborative filtering approach based on matrix factorization, frequently serves as a benchmark for recommender systems research. However, numerous studies often overlook the nuances of BPR implementation, claiming that it performs worse than newly proposed methods across various tasks. In this paper, we thoroughly examine the features of the BPR model, indicating their impact on its performance, and investigate open-source BPR implementations. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies between these implementations and the original BPR paper, leading to a significant decrease in performance of up to 50% for specific implementations. Furthermore, through extensive experiments on real-world datasets under modern evaluation settings, we demonstrate that with proper tuning of its hyperparameters, the BPR model can achieve performance levels close to state-of-the-art methods on the top-n recommendation tasks and even outperform them on specific datasets. Specifically, on the Million Song Dataset, the BPR model with hyperparameters tuning statistically significantly outperforms Mult-VAE by 10% in NDCG@100 with binary relevance function.</p>

    <h3>Calibrating the Predictions for Top-N Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Sato</p>
    <p>Well-calibrated predictions of user preferences are essential for many applications. Since recommender systems typically select the top-N items for users, calibration for those top-N items, rather than for all items, is important.  We show that previous calibration methods result in miscalibrated predictions for the top-N items, despite their excellent calibration performance when evaluated on all items.  In this work, we address the miscalibration in the top-N recommended items. We first define evaluation metrics for this objective and then propose a generic method to optimize calibration models focusing on the top-N items. It groups the top-N items by their ranks and optimizes distinct calibration models for each group with rank-dependent training weights.  We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for both explicit and implicit feedback datasets, using diverse classes of recommender models.</p>

    <h3>Automatic Collection Creation and Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manjeet Dahiya, Piyush Singh, Sanidhya Singal</p>
    <p>We present a collection recommender system that can automatically create and recommend collections of items at a user level. Unlike regular recommender systems, which output top-N relevant items, a collection recommender system outputs collections of items such that the items in the collections are relevant to a user, and the items within a collection follow a specific theme. Our system builds on top of the user-item representations learnt by item recommender systems. We employ dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques along with intuitive heuristics to create collections with their ratings and titles. We test these ideas in a real-world setting of music recommendation, within a popular music streaming service. We find that there is a 2.3x increase in recommendation-driven consumption when recommending collections over items. Further, it results in effective utilization of real estate and leads to recommending a more and diverse set of items. To our knowledge, these are first of its kind experiments at such a large scale.</p>

    <h3>Combining Rating and Review Data by Initializing Latent Factor Models with Topic Models for Top-N Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barry Smyth, Aonghus Lawlor, Francisco J. Peña, Diarmuid O’Reilly-Morgan, Elias Z. Tragos, Erika Duriakova, Neil Hurley</p>
    <p>Nowadays we commonly have multiple sources of data associated with items. Users may provide numerical ratings, or implicit interactions, but may also provide textual reviews. Although many algorithms have been proposed to jointly learn a model over both interactions and textual data, there is room to improve the many factorization models that are proven to work well on interactions data, but are not designed to exploit textual information. Our focus in this work is to propose a simple, yet easily applicable and effective, method to incorporate review data into such factorization models. In particular, we propose to build the user and item embeddings within the topic space of a topic model learned from the review data. This has several advantages: we observe that initializing the user and item embeddings in topic space leads to faster convergence of the factorization algorithm to a model that out-performs models initialized randomly, or with other state-of-the-art initialization strategies. Moreover, constraining user and item factors to topic space allows for the learning of an interpretable model that users can visualise.</p>

    <h3>Performance of Hyperbolic Geometry Models in Top-N Recommendation Tasks (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Tuzhilin, Evgeny Frolov, Leyla Mirvakhabova, Valentin Khrulkov, Ivan Oseledets</p>
    <p>We introduce a simple autoencoder based on hyperbolic geometry for solving standard collaborative filtering problem. In contrast to many modern deep learning techniques, we build our solution using only a single hidden layer. Remarkably, even with such a minimalistic approach, we not only outperform the Euclidean counterpart but also achieve a competitive performance with respect to the current state-of-the-art. We additionally explore the effects of space curvature on the quality of hyperbolic models and propose an efficient data-driven method for estimating its optimal value.</p>

    <h3>On the Robustness and Discriminative Power of IR Metrics for Top-N Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Bellogin, Daniel Valcarce, Pablo Castells, Javier Parapar</p>
    <p>The evaluation of Recommender Systems is still an open issue in the field. Despite its limitations, offline evaluation usually constitutes the first step in assessing recommendation methods due to its reduced costs and high reproducibility. Selecting the appropriate metric is a central issue in offline evaluation. Among the properties of recommendation systems, ranking accuracy attracts the most attention nowadays. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the advantages of different ranking metrics which were previously used in Information Retrieval and are now typically used for assessing top-N recommender systems. We propose methodologies for comparing the robustness and the discriminative power of different metrics. On the one hand, we study the influence of cut-offs and we find that deeper cut-offs offer greater robustness and discriminative power. On the other hand, we find that precision offers high robustness and Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain provides the best discriminative power.</p>

    <h3>Learning to Rank with Trust and Distrust in Recommender Systems (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Rafailidis, Fabio Crestani</p>
    <p>The sparsity of users’ preferences can significantly degrade the quality of recommendations in the collaborative filtering strategy. To account for the fact that the selections of social friends and foes may improve the recommendation accuracy, we propose a learning to rank model that exploits users’ trust and distrust relationships. Our learning to rank model focusses on the performance at the top of the list, with the recommended items that end-users will actually see. In our model, we try to push the relevant items of users and their friends at the top of the list, while ranking low those of their foes. Furthermore, we propose a weighting strategy to capture the correlations of users’ preferences with friends’ trust and foes’ distrust degrees in two intermediate trust- and distrust-preference user latent spaces, respectively. Our experiments on the Epinions dataset show that the proposed learning to rank model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in the presence of sparsity in users’ preferences and when a part of trust and distrust relationships is not available. Furthermore, we demonstrate the crucial role of our weighting strategy in our model, to balance well the influences of friends and foes on users’ preferences.</p>

    <h3>Modelling Contextual Information in Session-Aware Recommender Systems with Neural Networks (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bartłomiej Twardowski</p>
    <p>Preparing recommendations for unknown users or such that correctly respond to the short-term needs of a particular user is one of the fundamental problems for e-commerce. Most of the common Recommender Systems assume that user identification must be explicit. In this paper a Session-Aware Recommender System approach is presented where no straightforward user information is required. The recommendation process is based only on user activity within a single session, defined as a sequence of events. This information is incorporated in the recommendation process by explicit context modeling with factorization methods and a novel approach with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Compared to the session modeling approach, RNN directly models the dependency of user observed sequential behavior throughout its recurrent structure. The evaluation discusses the results based on sessions from real-life system with ephemeral items (identified only by the set of their attributes) for the task of top-n best recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Fifty Shades of Ratings: How to Benefit from a Negative Feedback in Top-N Recommendations Tasks (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evgeny Frolov, Ivan Oseledets</p>
    <p>Conventional collaborative filtering techniques treat a top-n recommendations problem as a task of generating a list of the most relevant items. This formulation, however, disregards an opposite — avoiding recommendations with completely irrelevant items. Due to that bias, standard algorithms, as well as commonly used evaluation metrics, become insensitive to negative feedback. In order to resolve this problem we propose to treat user feedback as a categorical variable and model it with users and items in a ternary way. We employ a third-order tensor factorization technique and implement a higher order folding-in method to support online recommendations. The method is equally sensitive to entire spectrum of user ratings and is able to accurately predict relevant items even from a negative only feedback. Our method may partially eliminate the need for complicated rating elicitation process as it provides means for personalized recommendations from the very beginning of an interaction with a recommender system. We also propose a modification of standard metrics which helps to reveal unwanted biases and account for sensitivity to a negative feedback. Our model achieves state-of-the-art quality in standard recommendation tasks while significantly outperforming other methods in the cold-start “no-positive-feedback” scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Local Item-Item Models For Top-N Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> George Karypis, Evangelia Christakopoulou</p>
    <p>Item-based approaches based on SLIM (Sparse LInear Methods) have demonstrated very good performance for top-N recommendation; however they only estimate a single model for all the users. This work is based on the intuition that not all users behave in the same way — instead there exist subsets of like-minded users. By using different item-item models for these user subsets, we can capture differences in their preferences and this can lead to improved performance for top-N recommendations. In this work, we extend SLIM by combining global and local SLIM models. We present a method that computes the prediction scores as a user-specific combination of the predictions derived by a global and local item-item models. We present an approach in which the global model, the local models, their user-specific combination, and the assignment of users to the local models are jointly optimized to improve the top-N recommendation performance. Our experiments show that the proposed method improves upon the standard SLIM model and outperforms competing top-N recommendation approaches.</p>

    <h3>Towards Improving Top-N Recommendation by Generalization of SLIM (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alvaro Soto, Denis Parra, Santiago Larrain</p>
    <p>Sparse Linear Methods (SLIM) are state-of-the-art recommendation approaches based on matrix factorization, which rely on a regularized l1-norm and l2-norm optimization — an alternative optimization problem to the traditional Frobenious norm. Although they have shown outstanding performance in Top-N recommendation, existent works have not yet analyzed some inherent assumptions that can have an important effect on the performance of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to improve the performance of SLIM by proposing a generalized formulation of the aforementioned assumptions. Instead of directly learning a sparse representation of the user-item matrix, we (i) learn the latent factors’ matrix of the users and the items via a traditional matrix factorization approach, and then (ii) reconstruct the latent user or item matrix via prototypes which are learned using sparse coding, an alternative SLIM commonly used in the image processing domain. The results show that by tuning the parameters of our generalized model we are able to outperform SLIM in several Top-N recommendation experiments conducted on two different datasets, using both nDCG and nDCG@10 as evaluation metrics. These preliminary results, although not conclusive, indicate a promising line of research to improve the performance of SLIM recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Top-N Recommendation for Shared Accounts (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bart Goethals, Koen Verstrepen</p>
    <p>Standard collaborative filtering recommender systems assume that every account in the training data represents a single user. However, multiple users often share a single account. A typical example is a single shopping account for the whole family. Traditional recommender systems fail in this situation. If contextual information is available, context aware recommender systems are the state-of-the-art solution. Yet, often no contextual information is available. Therefore, we introduce the challenge of recommending to shared accounts in the absence of contextual information. We propose a solution to this challenge for all cases in which the reference recommender system is an item-based top-N collaborative filtering recommender system, generating recommendations based on binary, positive-only feedback. We experimentally show the advantages of our proposed solution for tackling the problems that arise from the existence of shared accounts on multiple datasets.</p>

    <p>When a new user registers to a recommender system service, the system does not know her taste and cannot propose meaningful suggestions (cold-start problem). This preliminary work attempts to mitigate the cold-start problem using the profile picture of the user as a sole information, following the intuition that a correspondence may exist between the pictures that people use to represent themselves and their taste. We proved that, at least in the small music community we used for our experiments, our method can improve the precision of both a classifier and a Top-N music recommender system in a cold-start condition.</p>

    <h3>Towards a Dynamic Top-N Recommendation Framework (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Liu</p>
    <p>Real world large-scale recommender systems are always dynamic: new users and items continuously enter the system, and the status of old ones (e.g., users’ preference and items’ popularity) evolve over time. In order to handle such dynamics, we propose a recommendation framework consisting of an online component and an offline component, where the newly arrived items are processed by the online component such that users are able to get suggestions for fresh information, and the influence of longstanding items is captured by the offline component. Based on individual users’ past rating behavior, recommendations from the two components are combined to provide top-N recommendation. We formulate recommendation problem as a ranking problem where learning to rank is applied to extend upon a latent factor model to optimize recommendation rankings by minimizing a pairwise loss function. Furthermore, to more accurately model interactions between users and items, Latent Dirichlet Allocation is incorporated to fuse rating information and textual information. Real data based experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models by at least 61.21% and 50.27% in terms of mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) respectively.</p>
