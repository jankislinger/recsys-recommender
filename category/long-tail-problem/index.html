    <h3>Co-occurrence Embedding Enhancement for Long-tail Problem in Multi-Interest Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyong Feng, Yaokun Liu, Minghui Zou, Xiaowang Zhang</p>
    <p>Multi-interest recommendation methods extract multiple interest vectors to represent the user comprehensively. Despite their success in the matching stage, previous works overlook the long-tail problem. This results in the model excelling at suggesting head items, while the performance for tail items, which make up more than 70% of all items, remains suboptimal. Hence, enhancing the tail item recommendation capability holds great potential for improving the performance of the multi-interest model. Through experimental analysis, we reveal that the insufficient context for embedding learning is the reason behind the underperformance of tail items. Meanwhile, we face two challenges in addressing this issue: the absence of supplementary item features and the need to maintain head item performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose a CoLT module (Co-occurrence embedding enhancement for Long-Tail problem) that replaces the embedding layer of existing multi-interest frameworks. By linking co-occurring items to establish “assistance relationships”, CoLT aggregates information from relevant head items into tail item embeddings and enables joint gradient updates. Experiments on three datasets show our method outperforms SOTA models by 21.86% Recall@50 and improves the Recall@50 of tail items by 14.62% on average.</p>

    <h3>Alleviating the Long-Tail Problem in Conversational Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Cao, Kun Zhou, Fan Pan, Zhipeng Zhao, Xiaolei Wang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) aim to provide the recommendation service via natural language conversations. To develop an effective CRS, high-quality CRS datasets are very crucial. However, existing CRS datasets suffer from the long-tail issue, \ie a large proportion of items are rarely (or even never) mentioned in the conversations, which are called long-tail items. As a result, the CRSs trained on these datasets tend to recommend frequent items,  and the diversity of the recommended items would be largely reduced, making users easier to get bored. To address this issue, this paper presents <b>LOT-CRS</b>, a novel framework that focuses on simulating and utilizing a balanced CRS dataset (\ie covering all the items evenly) for improving <b>LO</b>ng-<b>T</b>ail recommendation performance of CRSs. In our approach, we design two pre-training tasks to enhance the understanding of simulated conversation for long-tail items, and adopt retrieval-augmented fine-tuning with label smoothness strategy to further improve the recommendation of long-tail items. Extensive experiments on two public CRS datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and extensibility of our approach, especially on long-tail recommendation. All the experimental codes will be released after the review period.</p>

    <h3>ProtoCF: Prototypical Collaborative Filtering for Few-shot Item Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aravind Sankar, Hari Sundaram, Junting Wang, Adit Krishnan</p>
    <p>In recent times, deep learning methods have supplanted conventional collaborative filtering approaches as the backbone of modern recommender systems. However, their gains are skewed towards popular items with a drastic performance drop for the vast collection of long-tail items with sparse interactions. Moreover, we empirically show that prior neural recommenders lack the resolution power to accurately rank relevant items within the long-tail. In this paper, we formulate long-tail item recommendations as a few-shot learning problem of learning-to-recommend few-shot items with very few interactions. We propose a novel meta-learning framework ProtoCF that learns-to-compose robust prototype representations for few-shot items. ProtoCF utilizes episodic few-shot learning to extract meta-knowledge across a collection of diverse meta-training tasks designed to mimic item ranking within the tail. To further enhance discriminative power, we propose a novel architecture-agnostic technique based on knowledge distillation to extract, relate, and transfer knowledge from neural base recommenders. Our experimental results demonstrate that ProtoCF consistently outperforms state-of-art approaches on overall recommendation (by 5% Recall@50) while achieving significant gains (of 60-80% Recall@50) for tail items with less than 20 interactions.</p>
