    <h3>Optimizing the Selection of Recommendation Carousels with Quantum Computing (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Cremonesi, Nicolò Felicioni, Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema</p>
    <p>It has been long known that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the way we find solutions of problems that are difficult to solve on classical computers. It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple. We discuss its effectiveness, limitations and possible future directions of development.</p>

    <h3>Recommender Systems for Personalized User Experience: Lessons learned at Booking.com (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Kangas</p>
    <p>Booking.com is the world’s leading online travel platform where users make many decisions supported by our recommendations, such as destinations, travel dates, facilities, etc. This leads to a complex User Interface (UI) containing many widgets of different relevance for different users. We address the problem of constructing an optimal UI, a non-trivial problem, mainly due to user preferences evolving over time and multiple independent teams collaboratively building the UI. Our goal is to provide a personalized User Experience (UX) which adapts to changes in the environment and ensures governable, collaborative product development. The solution relies on a Multi Armed Bandits (MAB) framework currently allowing product teams to collaborate on the construction of UIs and serving millions of users every day. We present examples of our solution and lessons learned during their implementation.</p>
