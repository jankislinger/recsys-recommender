    <h3>Recommending Personalised Targeted Training Adjustments for Marathon Runners (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ciara Feely, Aonghus Lawlor, Barry Smyth, Brian Caulfield</p>
    <p>Preparing for the marathon involves many weeks of dedicated training. Achieving the right balance between building strength and endurance and the need for rest and recovery is a must, if a runner is to arrive at the start-line injury-free and ready to achieve their desired finish-time. However, because most recreational runners rely on generic training plans, they can struggle to find this balance, which can impact their motivation, health, and performance. In this paper, we describe a novel case-based reasoning approach to fine-tuning a runner’s training by recommending training adjustments based on the patterns of similar runners at corresponding points in their marathon training. The approach is designed to target training adjustments that are based on similar runners but with varying race goals,  to allow runners to adjust their training for slower or faster finish-times, as their training progresses and motivations change. We evaluate the recommendations produced using a large-scale real-world dataset according to several factors including, (i) the plausibility of the recommended training adjustment, (ii) the effectiveness of the adjustment when it comes to achieving a particular performance goal, and (iii) the safety of the adjustment in terms of the degree of risk that it will lead to an injury or otherwise disrupt training. Our findings suggest that plausible, effective, and safe recommendations can be generated for runners when evaluated against a range of race goals.</p>

    <h3>Fit to Run: Personalised Recommendations for Marathon Training (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aonghus Lawlor, Barry Smyth, Jakim Berndsen</p>
    <p>Training for the marathon is a complex problem. In order to run an optimal time, runners must find the right workload for their current abilities and identify the correct balance between the hard work and rest throughout their training programmes. We propose a recommender system that will help guide runners through the weeks leading up to the marathon. Using a large sample of marathon training data (8730 runners), we generate user profiles that capture both a runner’s current fitness and training levels, and leverage this information to generate tailored recommendations for future weeks of training. We investigate patterns of successful runners to determine how best to schedule recommendations and training to allow for improvement in fitness levels alongside adequate rest.</p>

    <h3>A Novel Recommender System for Helping Marathoners to Achieve a New Personal-Best (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barry Smyth, Padraig Cunningham</p>
    <p>We describe a novel application of recommender systems, helping marathon runners to run a new personal-best race-time, by predicting a challenging, but achievable, target-time and by recommending a race-plan to achieve this time that is tailored to their ability and the course. A comprehensive evaluation of prediction accuracy and race-plan quality is provided using a large-scale dataset with almost 400,000 runners from the last 12 years of the Chicago marathon.</p>
