    <h3>Do recommender systems make social media more susceptible to misinformation spreaders? (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonela Tommasel, Filippo Menczer</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are central to online information consumption and user-decision processes, as they help users find relevant information and establish new social relationships. However, recommenders could also (unintendedly) help propagate misinformation and increase the social influence of the spreading it. In this context, we study the impact of friend recommender systems on the social influence of misinformation spreaders on Twitter. To this end, we applied several user recommenders to a COVID-19 misinformation data collection. Then, we explore what-if scenarios to simulate changes in user misinformation spreading behaviour as an effect of the interactions in the recommended network. Our study shows that recommenders can indeed affect how misinformation spreaders interact with other users and influence them.</p>

    <h3>KA-Recsys: Knowledge Appropriate Patient Focused Recommendation Technologies (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khushboo Thaker</p>
    <p>Diseases such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease demand that patients take an active role in disease management and seek health information for decision-making and self-management [ 1]. The most common methods of providing reliable information to patients include health literacy workshops and patient education materials [12 , 15 ]. However, these materials are prepared for the general patient population and not always tailored to each patient’s specific needs [ 2, 12 ]. In addition, patients seek for their information needs through search engines. Previous studies have reported that search engines don’t always support information needs of patients [11 ]. Consequently, people seek information on disease specific online health communities (OHCs) [ 9 ]. But the risk of propagating misinformation still exists because existing OHCs do not provide an infrastructure to help patients find relevant and trustworthy information [ 8, 19 ].Existing patient focused health search engines and health recommender systems can accommodate better support of patients’ information needs by providing them trustworthy resources. However, current PHRS are personalized to patients’ interests and so information provided by these layperson-oriented systems is rather general [5, 6]. In fact, previous study has shown that a patient’s personal knowledge about their disease becomes more sophisticated over the course of disease [6 , 7]. Therefore, our principal motivation is to fill this gap in current PHRS, by investigating ways to suggest individualized health information that not only adapts to patients’ current information needs but also patients’ knowledge-level across the disease trajectory. The health materials recommended at the level of patients’ knowledge will not only help them engage with materials but also help in informed decision making and self management [16]. The goal of this research is to enhance state-of-the-art PHRS by exploring the technologies in the field of recommender systems and personalized learning so that PHRS can better suggest health information relevant to patients, which is appropriate to their changing knowledge level and in-line with their dynamic information need across their disease trajectory. Thus my research proposes a recommender that accommodates both patient interest and patient knowledge by integrating a patient knowledge model. The output of this research would be a knowledge-appropriate patient focused recommender system (KA-Recsys). As a case study, KA-Recsys will be implemented for ovarian cancer (OvCa) patients and integrated into HELPeR1.</p>

    <h3>Biases in Recommendation System (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saumya Bhadani</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems shape what people consume and experience online, which makes it critical to assess their effect on society and whether they are affected by any potential source of bias. My research focuses on a specific source of bias — popularity — that is especially relevant in two online contexts: news consumption, and cultural markets. Social media newsfeeds, which are designed to optimize the engagement of users, may inadvertently promote inaccurate and partisan news domains, since these are often popular among like-minded and polarized audiences. More generally, in any type of cultural market, popularity bias may lead to the suppression of niche quality products, which may not attract enough attention. In the context of online newsfeeds, I am investigating whether the political diversity of the audience of a news website can be used as signal of journalistic quality. In an analysis of a comprehensive dataset of news source reliability ratings and web browsing histories, I have shown that the diversity of the audience of a news website is a valuable signal to counter popularity bias and to promote journalistic quality. To further validate these results experimentally, I propose to have direct interactions with social media users through surveys. Here, I provide the details of a field study that I am planning to undertake using an experimental social media platform. More generally, in the context of any online cultural market, political audience diversity may not be applicable but the idea of diversity as a signal for higher quality might still be useful. For example, movies which are liked by an “age diverse” population or books which are read by racially diverse audience may have better quality than other items. However, in this research I have explored audience diversity in the context of social media newsfeeds only. For any online cultural market, I propose a method to quantify the popularity bias through an empirical analysis, using data from several existing markets. Accurately estimating the impact of popularity bias can help us advance our understanding of machine biases and also lead to the development of more robust recommendation systems.</p>
