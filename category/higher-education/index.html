    <h3>A College Major Recommendation System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gary Weiss, Yiwen Chen, Daniel Leeds, Samuel Stein</p>
    <p>College students are required to select a major but are often provided with only a modest amount of support in making this important decision. A poor decision is detrimental to the student, since it may result in the student later switching to a different major with a delay in graduation—or even result in the student leaving the university. This also impacts the university since time to graduation and retention rate are used to evaluate the quality of a university. There is a general lack of research on recommender systems for college majors, with the most relevant systems focusing on course-level recommendations. This study describes and evaluates a recommender system for selecting an undergraduate major, utilizing nine years of historical student data from a large university. The system bases its recommendations on the courses that the student takes in the first few years of college, and how well they performed in these courses. The system is designed to recommend majors that the student is likely to be interested in and will perform well in. Recommendations are evaluated based on the likelihood that the student's actual major was in the top five recommended majors, and whether the student performed above average in that major. The recommendation system dramatically outperforms the baseline strategy of randomly selecting a major, and when the recommendation is followed the student is 12% more likely to perform above average in the major.</p>

    <h3>Time Slice Imputation for Personalized Goal-based Recommendation in Higher Education (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary A. Pardos, Weijie Jiang</p>
    <p>Learners are often faced with the following scenario: given a goal for the future, and what they have learned in the past, what should they do now to best achieve their goal? We build on work utilizing deep learning to make inferences about how past actions correspond to future outcomes and enhance this work with a novel application of backpropagation to learn per-user optimized actions. We apply this technique to two datasets, one from a university setting in which courses can be recommended towards preparation for a target course, and one from massive open online courses (MOOCs) in which course pages can be recommended towards quiz preparation. In both cases, our algorithm is applied to recommend actions the learner can take to maximize a desired future achievement objective, given their past actions and performance. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Towards a Recommender System for Undergraduate Research (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Del Rio, Denis Parra, Erick Svec, Jovan Kuzmicic</p>
    <p>Several studies indicate that attracting students to research careers requires to engage them from early undergraduate years. Following this, the Engineering School at PUC Chile has developed an undergraduate research program that allows students to enroll in research in exchange for course credits. Moreover, we developed a web portal to inform students about the program, but participation remains lower than expected. In order to promote student engagement, we attempt to build a personalized recommender system of research opportunities to undergraduates. With this goal in mind we investigate two tasks. First, identifying students that are more willing to participate on this kind of program. A second task is generating a personalized list of recommendations of research opportunities for each student. To evaluate our approach, we perform a simulated prediction experiment with data from our school, which has more than 4,000 active undergraduate students nowadays. Results indicate that there is a big potential to create a personalized recommender system for this purpose. Our research can be used as a baseline for colleges seeking strategies to encourage research activities within undergraduate students.</p>

    <h3>A Recommender System for Personalized Exploration of Majors, Minors, and Concentrations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Young Park</p>
    <p>Many students change their majors during college. Choosing the right academic majors, minors, and concentrations within a major in higher education is challenging but crucial in assuring students’ overall academic and career success. Personalized prediction of student success in majors, minors, and concentrations will help students better find the right majors, minors, and concentrations for them, so as to timely achieve their academic goals. In this paper, we present a new recommender application for the academic major/minor/concentration selection problem in the educational domain. The proposed major/minor/concentration recommender system is a collaborative filtering-based recommender based on student grade prediction, and provides a variety of personalized predictions and recommendations on majors, minors, and concentrations. It is a useful tool to guide students, advisors, and administrators during the personalized major/minor/concentration exploration (declare/change) process.</p>
