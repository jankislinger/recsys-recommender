    <h3>Optimizing the Selection of Recommendation Carousels with Quantum Computing (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Cremonesi, Nicol√≤ Felicioni, Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema</p>
    <p>It has been long known that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the way we find solutions of problems that are difficult to solve on classical computers. It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple. We discuss its effectiveness, limitations and possible future directions of development.</p>

    <h3>EXTRA: Explaining Team Recommendation in Networks (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nan Cao, Qinghai Zhou, Hanghang Tong, Norbou Buchler, Liangyue Li</p>
    <p>State-of-the-art in network science of teams offers effective recommendation methods to answer questions like who is the best replacement, what is the best team expansion strategy, but lacks intuitive ways to explain why the optimization algorithm gives the specific recommendation for a given team optimization scenario. To tackle this problem, we develop an interactive prototype system, Extra, as the first step towards addressing such a sense-making challenge, through the lens of the underlying network where teams embed, to explain the team recommendation results. The main advantages are (1) Algorithm efficacy: we propose an effective and fast algorithm to explain random walk graph kernel, the central technique for networked team recommendation; (2) Intuitive visual explanation: we present intuitive visual analysis of the recommendation results, which can help users better understand the rationality of the underlying team recommendation algorithm.</p>

    <h3>On Parallelizing SGD for Pairwise Learning to Rank in Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fikret Gurgen, Murat Yagci, Tevfik Aytekin</p>
    <p>Learning to rank with pairwise loss functions has been found useful in collaborative filtering recommender systems. At web scale, the optimization is often based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) which has a sequential nature. We investigate two different shared memory lock-free parallel SGD schemes based on block partitioning and no partitioning for use with pairwise loss functions. To speed up convergence to a solution, we extrapolate simple practical algorithms from their application to pointwise learning to rank. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are quite useful regarding their ranking ability and speedup patterns in comparison to their sequential counterpart.</p>

    <h3>Towards Automatic Meal Plan Recommendations for Balanced Nutrition (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Elsweiler, Morgan Harvey</p>
    <p>Food recommenders have been touted as a useful tool to help people achieve a healthy diet. Here we incorporate nutrition into the recommender problem by examining the feasibility of algorithmically creating daily meal plans for a sample of user profiles (n=100), combined with a diverse set of food preference data (n=64) collected in a natural setting. Our analyses demonstrate it is possible to recommend plans for a large percentage of users which meet the guidelines set out by international health agencies.</p>
