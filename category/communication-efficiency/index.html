    <h3>FedLoCA: Low-Rank Coordinated Adaptation with Knowledge Decoupling for Federated Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yong Liao, Boyu Fan, Pengyuan Zhou, Siqing Zhang, Yuchen Ding, Wei Sun</p>
    <p>Privacy protection in recommendation systems is gaining increasing attention, for which federated learning has emerged as a promising solution. Current federated recommendation systems grapple with high communication overhead due to sharing dense global embeddings, and also poorly reflect user preferences due to data heterogeneity. To overcome these challenges, we propose a two-stage Federated Low-rank Coordinated Adaptation (FedLoCA) framework to decouple global and client-specific knowledge into low-rank embeddings, which significantly reduces communication overhead while enhancing the systemâ€™s ability to capture individual user preferences amidst data heterogeneity. Further, to tackle gradient estimation inaccuracies stemming from data sparsity in federated recommendation systems, we introduce an adversarial gradient projected descent approach in low-rank spaces, which significantly boosts model performance while maintaining robustness. Remarkably, FedLoCA also alleviates performance loss even under the stringent constraints of differential privacy. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that FedLoCA significantly outperforms existing methods in both recommendation accuracy and communication efficiency.</p>

    <h3>EANA: Reducing Privacy Risk on Large-scale Recommendation Models (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin Ning, Devora Berlowitz, Mei Chen, Shuang Song, Qiqi Xue, Steve Chien</p>
    <p>Embedding-based deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in large-scale recommendation systems. Differentially-private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) provides a way to enable personalized experiences while preserving user privacy by injecting noise into every model parameter during the training process. However, it is challenging to apply DP-SGD to large-scale embedding-based DNNs due to its effect on training speed. This happens because the noise added by DP-SGD causes normally sparse gradients to become dense, introducing a large communication overhead between workers and parameter servers in a typical distributed training framework. This paper proposes embedding-aware noise addition (EANA) to mitigate the communication overhead, making training a large-scale embedding-based DNN possible. We examine the privacy benefit of EANA both analytically and empirically using secret sharer techniques. We demonstrate that training with EANA can achieve reasonable model precision while providing good practical privacy protection as measured by the secret sharer tests. Experiments on a real-world, large-scale dataset and model show that EANA is much faster than standard DP-SGD, improving the training speed by 54X and unblocking the training of a large-scale embedding-based DNN with reduced privacy risk.</p>

    <h3>GASGD: Stochastic Gradient Descent for Distributed Asynchronous Matrix Completion via Graph Partitioning (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabio Petroni, Leonardo Querzoni</p>
    <p>Matrix completion latent factors models are known to be an effective method to build recommender systems. Currently, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is considered one of the best latent factor-based algorithm for matrix completion. In this paper we discuss GASGD, a distributed asynchronous variant of SGD for large-scale matrix completion, that (i) leverages data partitioning schemes based on graph partitioning techniques, (ii) exploits specific characteristics of the input data and (iii) introduces an explicit parameter to tune synchronization frequency among the computing nodes. We empirically show how, thanks to these features, GASGD achieves a fast convergence rate incurring in smaller communication cost with respect to current asynchronous distributed SGD implementations.</p>
