    <h3>The Role of Unknown Interactions in Implicit Matrix Factorization — A Probabilistic View (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bart Goethals, Joey De Pauw</p>
    <p>Matrix factorization is a well-known and effective methodology for top-k list recommendation. It became widely known during the Netflix challenge in 2006, and since then, many adapted and improved versions have been published. A particularly interesting matrix factorization algorithm called iALS (for implicit Alternating Least Squares) adapts the method for implicit feedback, i.e.\ a setting where only a very small amount of positive labels are available along with a majority of unknown labels. Compared to the classical task of rating prediction, learning from implicit feedback is applicable to many more domains, as the data is more abundant and requires less effort to elicit from users. However, the sparsity, imbalance, and implicit nature of the signal also pose unique challenges to retrieving the most relevant items to recommend. We revisit the role of unknown interactions in implicit matrix factorization. Traditionally, all unknowns are interpreted as negative samples and their importance in the training objective is then down-weighted to balance them out with the known, positive interactions. Interestingly, by adapting a probabilistic view of matrix factorization, we can retain the unknown nature of these interactions by modelling them as either positive or negative. With this new formulation that better fits the underlying data, we gain improved performance on the downstream recommendation task without any computational overhead compared to the popular iALS method. This paper outlines the key insights needed to adapt iALS to use logistic regression. Furthermore, the popular full-rank EASE model is identified as a special case of iALS. With this knowledge, EASE was trivially adapted to use logistic regression as well. An extensive experimental evaluation on several real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, a discrepancy between the need for weighting between factorization and regression models is discovered, leading towards a better understanding of these methods.</p>

    <h3>Can editorial decisions impair journal recommendations? Analysing the impact of journal characteristics on recommendation systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elias Entrup, Anett Hoppe, Ralph Ewerth</p>
    <p>Recommendation services for journals help scientists choose appropriate publication venues for their research results. They often use a semantic matching process to compare e.g. an abstract against already published articles. As these services can guide a researcher’s decision, their fairness and neutrality are critical qualities. However, the impact of journal characteristics (such as the abstract length) on recommendations is understudied. In this paper, we investigate whether editorial journal characteristics can lead to biased rankings from recommendation services, i.e. if editorial choices can systematically lead to a better ranking of one’s own journal. The performed experiments show that longer abstracts or a higher number of articles per journal can boost the rank of a journal in the recommendations. We apply these insights to an active, open-source journal recommendation system. The adaptation of the algorithm leads to an increased accuracy for smaller journals.</p>

    <h3>Denoising Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Zheng, Fei Wang, Chin-Chia Michael Yeh, Huiyuan Chen, Menghai Pan, Yusan Lin, Xiaoting Li, Hao Yang, Lan Wang</p>
    <p>Transformer-based sequential recommenders are very powerful for capturing both short-term and long-term sequential item dependencies. This is mainly attributed to their unique self-attention networks to exploit pairwise item-item interactions within the sequence. However, real-world item sequences are often noisy, which is particularly true for implicit feedback. For example, a large portion of clicks do not align well with user preferences, and many products end up with negative reviews or being returned. As such, the current user action only depends on a subset of items, not on the entire sequences. Many existing Transformer-based models use full attention distributions, which inevitably assign certain credits to irrelevant items. This may lead to sub-optimal performance if Transformers are not regularized properly.<br>Here we propose the Rec-denoiser model for better training of self-attentive recommender systems. In Rec-denoiser, we aim to adaptively prune noisy items that are unrelated to the next item prediction. To achieve this, we simply attach each self-attention layer with a trainable binary mask to prune noisy attentions, resulting in sparse and clean attention distributions. This largely purifies item-item dependencies and provides better model interpretability. In addition, the self-attention network is typically not Lipschitz continuous and is vulnerable to small perturbations. Jacobian regularization is further applied to the Transformer blocks to improve the robustness of Transformers for noisy sequences. Our Rec-denoiser is a general plugin that is compatible to many Transformers. Quantitative results on real-world datasets show that our Rec-denoiser outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

    <h3>Adapting Recommendations to Contextual Changes Using Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehdi Hosseinzadeh Aghdam, Negar Hariri, Bamshad Mobasher, Robin Burke</p>
    <p>Recommender systems help users find items of interest by tailoring their recommendations to users’ personal preferences. The utility of an item for a user, however, may vary greatly depending on that user’s specific situation or the context in which the item is used. Without considering these changes in preferences, the recommendations may match the general preferences of a user, but they may have small value for the user in his/her current situation. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical hidden Markov model for capturing changes in user’s preferences. Using a user’s feedback sequence on items, we model the user as a hierarchical hidden Markov process and the current context of the user as a hidden variable in this model. For a given user, our model is used to infer the maximum likelihood sequence of transitions between contextual states and to predict the probability distribution for the context of the next action. The predicted context is then used to generate recommendations. Our evaluation results using Last.fm music playlist data, indicate that this approach achieves significantly better performance in terms of accuracy and diversity compared to baseline methods.</p>
