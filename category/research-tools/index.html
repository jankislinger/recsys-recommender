    <h3>Rs4rs: Semantically Find Recent Publications from Top Recommendation System-Related Venues (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tri Kurniawan Wijaya, Gabor Fodor, Edoardo D’Amico, Manuel V. Loureiro</p>
    <p>Rs4rs is a web application designed to perform semantic search on recent papers from top conferences and journals related to Recommender Systems. Current scholarly search engine tools like Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and ResearchGate often yield broad results that fail to target the most relevant high-quality publications. Moreover, manually visiting individual conference and journal websites is a time-consuming process that primarily supports only syntactic searches. Rs4rs addresses these issues by providing a user-friendly platform where researchers can input their topic of interest and receive a list of recent, relevant papers from top Recommender Systems venues. Utilizing semantic search techniques, Rs4rs ensures that the search results are not only precise and relevant but also comprehensive, capturing papers regardless of<br>variations in wording. This tool significantly enhances research efficiency and accuracy, thereby benefitting the research community and public by facilitating access to high-quality, pertinent academic resources in the field of Recommender Systems. Rs4rs is available at https://rs4rs.com.</p>

    <h3>Introducing LensKit-Auto, an Experimental Automated Recommender System (AutoRecSys) Toolkit (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Vente, Michael Ekstrand, Joeran Beel</p>
    <p>LensKit is one of the first and most popular Recommender System Libraries. While LensKit offers a wide variety of features, it does not include any optimization strategies or guidelines on how to select and tune LensKit algorithms. LensKit developers have to manually include third-party libraries into their experimental setup or implement optimization strategies by hand to optimize hyperparameters. We found that 65.5% (19 out of 29) of papers using LensKit algorithms for their experiments did not select algorithms or tune hyperparameters. Non-optimized models represent poor baselines and produce less meaningful research results. This demo introduces LensKit-Auto. LensKit-Auto automates the entire Recommender System pipeline and enables LensKit developers to automatically select, optimize, and ensemble LensKit algorithms.</p>

    <h3>RecPack: An(other) Experimentation Toolkit for Top-N Recommendation using Implicit Feedback Data (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bart Goethals, Robin Verachtert, Lien Michiels</p>
    <p>RecPack is an easy-to-use, flexible and extensible toolkit for top-N recommendation with implicit feedback data. Its goal is to support researchers with the development of their recommendation algorithms, from similarity-based to deep learning algorithms, and allow for correct, reproducible and reusable experimentation. In this demo, we give an overview of the package and show how researchers can use it to their advantage when developing recommendation algorithms.</p>

    <h3>Multi-Step Critiquing User Interface for Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diana Andreea Petrescu, Diego Antognini, Boi Faltings</p>
    <p>Recommendations with personalized explanations have been shown to increase user trust and perceived quality and help users make better decisions. Moreover, such explanations allow users to provide feedback by critiquing them. Several algorithms for recommender systems with multi-step critiquing have therefore been developed. However, providing a user-friendly interface based on personalized explanations and critiquing has not been addressed in the last decade. In this paper, we introduce four different web interfaces (available under https://lia.epfl.ch/critiquing/) helping users making decisions and finding their ideal item. We have chosen the hotel recommendation domain as a use case even though our approach is trivially adaptable for other domains. Moreover, our system is model-agnostic (for both recommender systems and critiquing models) allowing a great flexibility and further extensions. Our interfaces are above all a useful tool to help research in recommendation with critiquing. They allow to test such systems on a real use case and also to highlight some limitations of these approaches to find solutions to overcome them.</p>

    <h3>PyRecGym: A Reinforcement Learning Gym for Recommender Systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barry Smyth, Elias Z. Tragos, Bichen Shi, Aonghus Lawlor, Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy, James Geraci, Neil Hurley</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RS) share many features and objectives with reinforcement learning (RL) systems. The former aim to maximise user satisfaction by recommending the right items to the right users at the right time, the latter maximise future rewards by selecting state-changing actions in some environment. The concept of an RL gym has become increasingly important when it comes to supporting the development of RL models. A gym provides a simulation environment in which to test and develop RL agents, providing a state model, actions, rewards/penalties etc. In this paper we describe and demonstrate the PyRecGym gym, which is specifi- cally designed for the needs of recommender systems research, by supporting standard test datasets (MovieLens, Yelp etc.), common input types (text, numeric etc.), and thereby offering researchers a reproducible research environment to accelerate experimentation and development of RL in RS. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Automating Recommender Systems Experimentation with librec-auto (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Burke, Xavier Sepulveda, Masoud Mansoury, Aldo Ordonez-Gauger</p>
    <p>Recommender systems research often requires the creation and execution of large numbers of algorithmic experiments to determine the sensitivity of results to the values of various hyperparameters. Existing recommender systems platforms fail to provide a basis for systematic experimentation of this type. In this paper, we describe librec-auto, a wrapper for the well-known LibRec library, which provides an environment that supports automated experimentation.</p>

    <h3>ParsRec: A Meta-Learning Recommender System for Bibliographic Reference Parsing Tools (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joeran Beel, Dominika Tkaczyk</p>
    <p>Bibliographic reference parsers extract metadata (e.g. author names, title, year) from bibliographic reference strings. No reference parser consistently gives the best results in every scenario. For instance, one tool may be best in extracting titles, and another tool in extracting author names. In this paper, we address the problem of reference parsing from a recommender-systems perspective. We propose ParsRec, a meta-learning approach that recommends the potentially best parser(s) for a given reference string. We evaluate ParsRec on 105k references from chemistry. We propose two approaches to meta-learning recommendations. The first approach learns the best parser for an entire reference string. The second approach learns the best parser for each field of a reference string. The second approach achieved a 2.6% increase in F1 (0.909 vs. 0.886, p < 0.001) over the best single parser (GROBID), reducing the false positive rate by 20.2% (0.075 vs. 0.094), and the false negative rate by 18.9% (0.107 vs. 0.132).</p>

    <h3>T-RecS: A Framework for a Temporal Semantic Analysis of the ACM Recommender Systems Conference (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Lops, Fedelucio Narducci, Marco De Gemmis, Giovanni Semeraro, Pierpaolo Basile</p>
    <p>This paper presents T-RecS (Temporal analysis of Recommender Systems conference proceedings), a framework that supplies services to analyze the Recommender Systems Conference proceedings from the first edition, held in 2007, to the last one, held in 2015, under a temporal point of view. The idea behind T-RecS is to identify linguistic phenomena that reflect some interesting variations for the research community, such as topic drift, or how the correlation between two terms changed over time, or how similarity between two authors evolved over time. The implemented framework can be easily adapted for the analysis of different corpora and domains.</p>
