    <h3>Integrating Item Relevance in Training Loss for Sequential Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Bacciu, Federico Siciliano, Fabrizio Silvestri, Nicola Tonellotto</p>
    <p>Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) are a popular type of recommender system that leverages user history to predict the next item of interest. However, the presence of noise in user interactions, stemming from account sharing, inconsistent preferences, or accidental clicks, can significantly impact the robustness and performance of SRSs, particularly when the entire item set to be predicted is noisy. This situation is more prevalent when only one item is used to train and evaluate the SRSs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach that addresses the issue of noise in SRSs. First, we propose a sequential multi-relevant future items training objective, leveraging a loss function aware of item relevance, thereby enhancing their robustness against noise in the training data. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of noise at evaluation time, we propose multi-relevant future items evaluation (MRFI-evaluation), aiming to improve overall performance. Our relevance-aware models obtain an improvement of ~1.58\% of NDCG@10 and 0.96\% in terms of HR@10 in the traditional evaluation protocol, the one which utilizes one relevant future item. In the MRFI-evaluation protocol, using multiple future items, the improvement is ~2.82\% of NDCG@10 and ~0.64\% of HR@10 w.r.t the best baseline model.</p>

    <h3>Of Spiky SVDs and Music Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darius Afchar, Romain Hennequin, Vincent Guigue</p>
    <p>The truncated singular value decomposition is a widely used methodology in music recommendation for direct similar-item retrieval or embedding musical items for downstream tasks. This paper investigates a curious effect that we show naturally occurring on many recommendation datasets: spiking formations in the embedding space. We first propose a metric to quantify this spiking organization’s strength, then mathematically prove its origin tied to underlying communities of items of varying internal popularity. With this new-found theoretical understanding, we finally open the topic with an industrial use case of estimating how music embeddings’ top-k similar items will change over time under the addition of data.</p>

    <h3>A Case Study on Sampling Strategies for Evaluating Neural Sequential Item Recommendation Models (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Zoller, Andreas Hotho, Alexander Dallmann</p>
    <p>At the present time, sequential item recommendation models are compared by calculating metrics on a small item subset (target set) to speed up computation. The target set contains the relevant item and a set of negative items that are sampled from the full item set. Two well-known strategies to sample negative items are uniform random sampling and sampling by popularity to better approximate the item frequency distribution in the dataset. Most recently published papers on sequential item recommendation rely on sampling by popularity to compare the evaluated models. However, recent work has already shown that an evaluation with uniform random sampling may not be consistent with the full ranking, that is, the model ranking obtained by evaluating a metric using the full item set as target set, which raises the question whether the ranking obtained by sampling by popularity is equal to the full ranking. In this work, we re-evaluate current state-of-the-art sequential recommender models from the point of view, whether these sampling strategies have an impact on the final ranking of the models. We therefore train four recently proposed sequential recommendation models on five widely known datasets. For each dataset and model, we employ three evaluation strategies. First, we compute the full model ranking. Then we evaluate all models on a target set sampled by the two different sampling strategies, uniform random sampling and sampling by popularity with the commonly used target set size of 100, compute the model ranking for each strategy and compare them with each other. Additionally, we vary the size of the sampled target set. Overall, we find that both sampling strategies can produce inconsistent rankings compared with the full ranking of the models. Furthermore, both sampling by popularity and uniform random sampling do not consistently produce the same ranking when compared over different sample sizes. Our results suggest that like uniform random sampling, rankings obtained by sampling by popularity do not equal the full ranking of recommender models and therefore both should be avoided in favor of the full ranking when establishing state-of-the-art.</p>
