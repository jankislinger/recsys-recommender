    <h3>Adaptive Fusion of Multi-View for Graph Contrastive Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Zhou, Jianwei Yin, Meng Xi, Ying Li, Mengduo Yang, Xiaohua Pan, Yi Yuan, Yangyang Wu, Jinshan Zhang</p>
    <p>Recommendation is a key mechanism for modern users to access items of their interests from massive entities and information. Recently, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has demonstrated satisfactory results on recommendation, due to its ability to enhance representation by integrating graph neural networks (GNNs) with contrastive learning. However, those methods often generate contrastive views by performing random perturbation on edges or embeddings, which is likely to bring noise in representation learning. Besides, in all these methods, the degree of user preference on items is omitted during the representation learning process, which may cause incomplete user/item modeling. To address these limitations, we propose the Adaptive Fusion of Multi-View Graph Contrastive Recommendation (AMGCR) model. Specifically, to generate the informative and less noisy views for better contrastive learning, we design four view generators to learn the edge weights focusing on weight adjustment, feature transformation, neighbor aggregation, and attention mechanism, respectively. Then, we employ an adaptive multi-view fusion module to combine different views from both the view-shared and the view-specific levels. Moreover, to make the model capable of capturing preference information during the learning process, we further adopt a preference refinement strategy on the fused contrastive view. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AMGCR consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, with average improvements of over 10% in terms of Recall and NDCG.</p>

    <h3>Revisiting LightGCN: Unexpected Inflexibility, Inconsistency, and A Remedy Towards Improved Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Geon Lee, Kijung Shin, Kyungho Kim</p>
    <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as effective tools in recommender systems. Among various GNN models, LightGCN is distinguished by its simplicity and outstanding performance. Its efficiency has led to widespread adoption across different domains, including social, bundle, and multimedia recommendations. In this paper, we thoroughly examine the mechanisms of LightGCN, focusing on its strategies for scaling embeddings, aggregating neighbors, and pooling embeddings across layers. Our analysis reveals that, contrary to expectations based on its design, LightGCN suffers from inflexibility and inconsistency when applied to real-world data. We introduce LightGCN++, an enhanced version of LightGCN designed to address the identified limitations. LightGCN++ incorporates flexible scaling of embedding norms and neighbor weighting, along with a tailored approach for pooling layer-wise embeddings to resolve the identified inconsistencies. Despite its remarkably simple remedy, extensive experimental results demonstrate that LightGCN++ significantly outperforms LightGCN, achieving an improvement of up to 17.81% in terms of NDCG@20. Furthermore, state-of-the-art models utilizing LightGCN as a backbone for item, bundle, multimedia, and knowledge-graph-based recommendations exhibit improved performance when equipped with LightGCN++.</p>

    <h3>Sequential Recommendation Models: A Graph-based Perspective (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Peintner</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RecSys) traditionally leverage the usersâ€™ rich interaction data with the system, but ignore the sequential dependency of items. Sequential recommender systems aim to predict the next item the user will interact with (e.g., click on, purchase, or listen to) based on the preceding interactions of the user. Current state-of-the-art approaches focus on transformer-based architectures and graph neural networks. Specifically, the modeling of sequences as graphs has shown to be a promising approach to introduce a structured bias into the recommendation learning framework. In this work, we will outline our research of exploring different applications of graphs in sequential recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Explainable Graph Neural Network Recommenders; Challenges and Opportunities (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Reza Mohammadi</p>
    <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in recommendation tasks by effectively capturing intricate connections among users, items, and their associated features. Given the escalating demand for interpretability, current research endeavors in the domain of GNNs for Recommender Systems (RecSys) necessitate the development of explainer methodologies to elucidate the decision-making process underlying GNN-based recommendations. In this work, we aim to present our research focused on techniques to extend beyond the existing approaches for addressing interpretability in GNN-based RecSys.</p>
