    <h3>Recommenders in banking: An end-to-end personalization pipeline within ING (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Santiago Gil-Begue</p>
    <p>Retail services in corporate international banks are often constrained by the compliance and infrastructure specificities of the countries in which they operate. In addition, the business model and customers interactions through a banking app differ greatly from other major retail services in sectors like digital streaming or e-commerce platforms. We introduce ING’s Bank retail recommender system, elaborating on how we account for the global vs. local requirements, and how can we benefit from such an approach for our model selection as well as products serving.</p>

    <h3>History-Augmented Collaborative Filtering for Financial Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baptiste Barreau, Laurent Carlier</p>
    <p>In many businesses, and particularly in finance, the behavior of a client might drastically change over time. It is consequently crucial for recommender systems used in such environments to be able to adapt to these changes. In this study, we propose a novel collaborative filtering algorithm that captures the temporal context of a user-item interaction through the users’ and items’ recent interaction histories to provide dynamic recommendations. The algorithm, designed with issues specific to the financial world in mind, uses a custom neural network architecture that tackles the non-stationarity of users’ and items’ behaviors. The performance and properties of the algorithm are monitored in a series of experiments on a G10 bond request for quotation proprietary database from BNP Paribas Corporate and Institutional Banking.</p>

    <h3>Recommender Systems for Banking and Financial Services (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Danele Regoli, Andrea Gigli, Fabrizio Lillo</p>
    <p>In this work we demonstrate the usefulness of the application of Recommender Systems in the financial domain. Specifically we investigate a dataset, made available by a major European bank, containing the purchases of a large set of investment assets by 200k investors. We also present some preliminary results of the application of network analysis via statistical validation to identify clusters of investment assets.</p>
