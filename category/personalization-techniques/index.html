    <h3>Exploratory Analysis of Recommending Urban Parks for Health-Promoting Activities (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Quercia, Sanja Šćepanović, Ke Zhou, Linus W. Dietz</p>
    <p>Parks are essential spaces for promoting urban health, and recommender systems could assist individuals in discovering parks for leisure and health-promoting activities. This is particularly important in large cities like London, which has over 1,500 named parks, making it challenging to understand what each park offers. Due to the lack of datasets and the diverse health-promoting activities parks can support (e.g., physical, social, nature-appreciation), it is unclear which recommendation algorithms are best suited for this task. To explore the dynamics of recommending parks for specific activities, we created two datasets: one from a survey of over 250 London residents, and another by inferring visits from over 1 million geotagged Flickr images taken in London parks. Analyzing the geographic patterns of these visits revealed that recommending nearby parks is ineffective, suggesting that this recommendation task is distinct from Point of Interest recommendation. We then tested various recommendation models, identifying a significant popularity bias in the results. Additionally, we found that personalized models have advantages in recommending parks beyond the most popular ones. The data and findings from this study provide a foundation for future research on park recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Recommenders in banking: An end-to-end personalization pipeline within ING (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Santiago Gil-Begue</p>
    <p>Retail services in corporate international banks are often constrained by the compliance and infrastructure specificities of the countries in which they operate. In addition, the business model and customers interactions through a banking app differ greatly from other major retail services in sectors like digital streaming or e-commerce platforms. We introduce ING’s Bank retail recommender system, elaborating on how we account for the global vs. local requirements, and how can we benefit from such an approach for our model selection as well as products serving.</p>

    <h3>Intent-Aware Diversification using Item-Based SubProfiles (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mesut Kaya, Derek Bridge</p>
    <p>In many approaches to recommendation diversification, a recommender scores items for relevance and then re-ranks them to balance relevance with diversity. In intent-aware diversification, diversity is formulated in terms of coverage of aspects, where aspects are either explicit such as movie genres or implicit such as the latent factors found during matrix factorization. Typically, the same set of aspects is used across all users. In this paper, we propose a form of personalized intent-aware diversification, which we call SPAD (SubProfile-Aware Diversification). The aspects we use in SPAD are subprofiles of the user’s profile. They are not defined in terms of explicit or implicit features. We compare SPAD to other forms of intent-aware diversification. We present empirical results in support of SPAD.</p>

    <h3>Powering Content Discovery through Scalable, Realtime Profiling of Users’ Content Preferences (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roy Bass, Baruch Brutman, Yoram Dayagi, Ido Tamir, Guy Kobrinsky, Ronny Lempel</p>
    <p>Outbrain is the Web’s leading content discovery service, recommending billions of stories daily to a global audience across many of the world’s most prestigious and respected publishers. Outbrain’s recommendation technology combines contextual cues with personalization, where the personalization aspects are a combination of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. This paper, and the accompanying demo of a production system, offer a behind-the-scenes view of the content-based aspects of Outbrain’s personalization technology. We detail the types of features we extract from content, as well as the attributes we keep in each user’s content-affinity profile. We then describe and demonstrate how we update each user’s profile, in real time, as the user consumes content while browsing the Web.</p>
