    <h3>Revisiting LightGCN: Unexpected Inflexibility, Inconsistency, and A Remedy Towards Improved Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Geon Lee, Kijung Shin, Kyungho Kim</p>
    <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as effective tools in recommender systems. Among various GNN models, LightGCN is distinguished by its simplicity and outstanding performance. Its efficiency has led to widespread adoption across different domains, including social, bundle, and multimedia recommendations. In this paper, we thoroughly examine the mechanisms of LightGCN, focusing on its strategies for scaling embeddings, aggregating neighbors, and pooling embeddings across layers. Our analysis reveals that, contrary to expectations based on its design, LightGCN suffers from inflexibility and inconsistency when applied to real-world data. We introduce LightGCN++, an enhanced version of LightGCN designed to address the identified limitations. LightGCN++ incorporates flexible scaling of embedding norms and neighbor weighting, along with a tailored approach for pooling layer-wise embeddings to resolve the identified inconsistencies. Despite its remarkably simple remedy, extensive experimental results demonstrate that LightGCN++ significantly outperforms LightGCN, achieving an improvement of up to 17.81% in terms of NDCG@20. Furthermore, state-of-the-art models utilizing LightGCN as a backbone for item, bundle, multimedia, and knowledge-graph-based recommendations exhibit improved performance when equipped with LightGCN++.</p>

    <h3>Do Channels Matter?: Illuminating Interpersonal Influence on Music Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minju Park, So Yeon Park, Kyogu Lee, Hyun Jeong Kim</p>
    <p>Researchers and service providers have focused on leveraging social information acquired from interactions between users to improve the accuracy of system recommendations. However, few have explained the characteristics of music recommendations through interpersonal relationships. To investigate how interpersonal relationships affect users’ evaluation of music recommendation, we conducted a survey-based study that compared two types of recommendation channels—interpersonal (i.e., from friends) and non-interpersonal (i.e., from systems). We found that relevance was evaluated higher in music recommended from non-interpersonal channels on average, while diversity, novelty, and serendipity were higher in interpersonal channels. Non-interpersonal channels surpassed interpersonal channels in terms of convenience, frequency, and adoption rate. These results illustrate that interpersonal and non-interpersonal channels have different strengths and that digital streaming platforms, which have mainly provided system recommendations thus far, need to better support interpersonal channels for richer user experience.</p>

    <h3>User Preferences in Recommendation Algorithms: The Influence of User Diversity, Trust, and Product Category on Privacy Perceptions in Recommender Algorithms (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> André Calero Valdez, Johannes Nakayama, Martina Ziefle, Nils Plettenberg, Laura Burbach</p>
    <p>The use of recommendation systems is widespread in online commerce. Depending on the algorithm that is used in the recommender system different types of data are recorded from user interactions. Typically better recommendations are achieved when more detailed data about the user and product is available. However, users are often unaware of what data is stored and how it is used in recommendation. In a survey study with 197 participants we introduced different recommendation techniques (collaborative filtering, content-based recommendation, trust-based and social recommendation) to the users and asked participants to rate what type of algorithm should be used for what type of product category (books, mobile phones, contraceptives). We found different patterns of preferences for different product categories. The more sensitive the product the higher the preference for content-based filtering approaches that could work without storing personal data. Trust-based and social approaches utilizing data from social media were generally rejected.</p>

    <h3>Optimally Balancing Receiver and Recommended Users’ Importance in Reciprocal Recommender Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Ricci, Rosenfeld Ariel, Akiva Kleinerman, Sarit Kraus</p>
    <p>Online platforms which assist people in finding a suitable partner or match, such as online dating and job recruiting environments, have become increasingly popular in the last decade. Many of these platforms include recommender systems which aim to help users discover other people who will be also interested in them. These recommender systems benefit from contemplating the interest of both sides of the recommended match, however the question of how to optimally balance the interest and the response of both sides remains open. In this study we present a novel recommendation method for recommending people to people. For each user receiving a recommendation, our method finds the optimal balance of two criteria: a) the user’s likelihood to accept the recommendation; and b) the recommended user’s likelihood to positively respond. We extensively evaluate our recommendation method with a group of active users from an operational online dating site. We find that our method is significantly more effective in increasing the number of successful interactions compared to a current state-of-the-art recommendation method.</p>

    <h3>A Probabilistic Model for Using Social Networks in Personalized Item Recommendation (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tinpa Eliassi-Rad, David M. Blei, Allison J.B. Chaney</p>
    <p>Preference-based recommendation systems have transformed how we consume media. By analyzing usage data, these methods uncover our latent preferences for items (such as articles or movies) and form recommendations based on the behavior of others with similar tastes. But traditional preference-based recommendations do not account for the social aspect of consumption, where a trusted friend might point us to an interesting item that does not match our typical preferences. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between preference- and social-based recommendations. We develop (SPF), a probabilistic model that incorporates social network information into a traditional factorization method; SPF introduces the social aspect to algorithmic recommendation. We develop a scalable algorithm for analyzing data with SPF, and demonstrate that it outperforms competing methods on six real-world datasets; data sources include a social reader and Etsy.</p>

    <h3>A Personalised Reader for Crowd Curated Content (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iskander Yusof, Daoud Clarke, Matteo Venanzi, Gabriella Kazai</p>
    <p>Personalised news recommender systems traditionally rely on content ingested from a select set of publishers and ask users to indicate their interests from a predefined list of topics. They then provide users a feed of news items for each of their topics. In this demo, we present a mobile app that automatically learns users’ interests from their browsing or twitter history and provides them with a personalised feed of diverse, crowd curated content. The app also continuously learns from the users’ interactions as they swipe to like or skip items recommended to them. In addition, users can discover trending stories and content liked by other users they follow. The crowd is thus formed of the users, who as a whole act as the curators of the content to be recommended.</p>
