    <h3>Learned Ranking Function: From Short-term Behavior Predictions to Long-term User Satisfaction (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Wu, Jennifer She, Daryl Chang, Lukasz Heldt, Zhe Zhao, Li Wei</p>
    <p>We present the Learned Ranking Function (LRF), a system that takes short-term user-item behavior predictions as input and outputs a slate of recommendations directly optimizing for long-term user satisfaction. Most previous work is based on optimizing hyper-parameters of a heuristic function. We propose to model the problem directly as a slate optimization problem with the objective of maximizing long-term user satisfaction. We also develop a new constraint optimization method that is able to improve the stability for multi-objective optimization. We evaluate our approach with live experiments and describe its deployment on YouTube.</p>

    <h3>The Fault in Our Recommendations: On the Perils of Optimizing the Measurable (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshit Kumar, Yash Kanoria, Omar Besbes</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems play a pivotal role on digital platforms by curating content, products and services for users. These systems are widespread, and through customized recommendations, promise to match users with options they will like. To that end,  data on engagement is collected and used, with, e.g., measurements of clicks, but also  purchases or consumption times.   Most recommendation systems are ranking-based, where they rank and recommend items based on their predicted engagement.  However, the engagement signals  are often only a crude proxy for user utility, as data on the latter is rarely collected or available. This paper explores the following critical research question: By optimizing for measurable proxies, are recommendation systems at risk of significantly under-delivering on user utility? If that is indeed the case, how can one improve utility which is seldom measured? To study these questions, we introduce a model of repeated user consumption in which, at each interaction, users select between an outside option and the best option from a recommendation set. Our model accounts for user heterogeneity, with the majority preferring “popular” content, and a minority favoring “niche” content. The system initially lacks knowledge of individual user preferences but can learn these preferences through observations of users’ choices over time. Our theoretical and numerical analysis demonstrate that optimizing for engagement signals can lead to significant utility losses. Instead, we propose a utility-aware policy that initially recommends a mix of popular and niche content. We show that such a policy substantially improves  utility despite not measuring it. In fact, in the limit of a forward-looking platform with discount factor $\delta \to 1$, our utility-aware policy achieves the best of both worlds: near-optimal user utility and near-optimal engagement simultaneously. Our study elucidates  an important feature of recommendation systems; given the ability to suggest multiple items, one can perform significant exploration without incurring significant reductions in short term engagement. By recommending high-risk, high-reward items alongside popular items, systems can enhance discovery of high utility items without significantly affecting engagement.</p>

    <h3>Interpretable User Retention Modeling in Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leyu Lin, Xiaochun Yang, Ruobing Xie, Kaikai Ge, Xu Zhang, Xiaobo Hao, Jie Zhou, Rui Ding</p>
    <p>Recommendation usually focuses on immediate accuracy metrics like CTR as training objectives. User retention rate, which reflects the percentage of today’s users that will return to the recommender system in the next few days, should be paid more attention to in real-world systems. User retention is the most intuitive and accurate reflection of user long-term satisfaction. However, most existing recommender systems are not focused on user retention-related objectives, since their complexity and uncertainty make it extremely hard to discover why a user will or will not return to a system and which behaviors affect user retention. In this work, we conduct a series of preliminary explorations on discovering and making full use of the reasons for user retention in recommendation. Specifically, we make a first attempt to design a rationale contrastive multi-instance learning framework to explore the rationale and improve the interpretability of user retention. Extensive offline and online evaluations with detailed analyses of a real-world recommender system verify the effectiveness of our user retention modeling. We further reveal the real-world interpretable factors of user retention from both user surveys and explicit negative feedback quantitative analyses to facilitate future model designs.</p>
