    <h3>A Tool for Explainable Pension Fund Recommendations using Large Language Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edleno Silva de Moura, Eduardo Alves da Silva, Leandro Balby Marinho, Altigran Soares da Silva</p>
    <p>In this demo, we present a prototype tool designed to help financial advisors recommend private pension funds to investors based on their preferences, offering personalized investment suggestions. The tool leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), which enhance explainability by providing clear and understandable rationales for recommendations and effectively handles both sequential and cold-start scenarios. We outline the design, implementation, and results of a user-based evaluation using real-world data. The evaluation shows a high recommendation acceptance rate among financial advisors, highlighting the toolâ€™s potential to improve decision-making in financial advisory services.</p>

    <h3>StoryTime: Eliciting Preferences from Children for Book Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Keener, Michael Green, Michael D. Ekstrand, Ashlee Milton, Joshua Ames, Maria Soledad Pera</p>
    <p>We present StoryTime, a book recommender for children. Our web-based recommender is co-designed with children and uses images to elicit their preferences. By building on existing solutions related to both visual interfaces and book recommendation strategies for children, StoryTime can generate suggestions without historical data or adult guidance. We discuss the benefits of StoryTime as a starting point for further research exploring the cold start problem, incorporating historical data, and needs related to children as a complex audience to enhance the recommendation process.</p>

    <h3>Using Citation-Context to Reduce Topic Drifting on Pure Citation-Based Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anita Khadka, Petr Knoth</p>
    <p>Recent works in the area of academic recommender systems have demonstrated the effectiveness of co-citation and citation closeness in related-document recommendations. However, documents recommended from such systems may drift away from the main concept of the query document. In this work, we investigate whether incorporating the textual information in close proximity to a citation as well as the citation position could reduce such drifting and further increase the performance of the recommender system. To investigate this, we run experiments with several recommendation methods on a newly created and now publicly available dataset containing 53 million unique citation based records. We then conduct a user-based evaluation with domain-knowledgeable participants. Our results show that a new method based on the combination of Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA), topic modelling and word embeddings achieve more than 20% improvement in Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) compared to CPA.</p>
