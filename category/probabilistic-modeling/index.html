    <h3>Negative-Aware Collaborative Filtering (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Neng Chuang, Chuan-Ju Wang, Ming-Feng Tsai, Sheng-Fang Yang, Sheng-Chieh Lin</p>
    <p>Most traditional recommender systems regard unseen user-item associations as negative user preferences and optimize recommendation models mainly based on observed associations and some negative instances sampled from unseen associations. However, such unseen user-item associations may contain potential positive user preferences on items and are not uniformly distributed in terms of the possibility of being negative (or positive) user preference; therefore, it is essential to quantify such associations for model training. Along this line, in this paper, in contrast to existing recommendation models, which equally treat all unseen associations as negative samples, we present a negative-aware recommendation approach that explicitly models the likelihood of each unseen association being a potentially positive preference. Empirical results on real-world datasets in different fields show that our approach consistently improves recommendation performance.</p>

    <h3>A Study of Priors for Relevance-Based Language Modelling of Recommender Systems (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Parapar, Daniel Valcarce, Álvaro Barreiro</p>
    <p>Probabilistic modelling of recommender systems naturally introduces the concept of prior probability into the recommendation task. Relevance-Based Language Models, a principled probabilistic query expansion technique in Information Retrieval, has been recently adapted to the item recommendation task with success. In this paper, we study the effect of the item and user prior probabilities under that framework. We adapt two priors from the document retrieval field and then we propose other two new probabilistic priors. Evidence gathered from experimentation indicates that a linear prior for the neighbour and a probabilistic prior based on Dirichlet smoothing for the items improve the quality of the item recommendation ranking.</p>

    <h3>Adapting Recommendations to Contextual Changes Using Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehdi Hosseinzadeh Aghdam, Negar Hariri, Bamshad Mobasher, Robin Burke</p>
    <p>Recommender systems help users find items of interest by tailoring their recommendations to users’ personal preferences. The utility of an item for a user, however, may vary greatly depending on that user’s specific situation or the context in which the item is used. Without considering these changes in preferences, the recommendations may match the general preferences of a user, but they may have small value for the user in his/her current situation. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical hidden Markov model for capturing changes in user’s preferences. Using a user’s feedback sequence on items, we model the user as a hierarchical hidden Markov process and the current context of the user as a hidden variable in this model. For a given user, our model is used to infer the maximum likelihood sequence of transitions between contextual states and to predict the probability distribution for the context of the next action. The predicted context is then used to generate recommendations. Our evaluation results using Last.fm music playlist data, indicate that this approach achieves significantly better performance in terms of accuracy and diversity compared to baseline methods.</p>
