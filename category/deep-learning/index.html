    <h3>Multi-Behavioral Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shereen Elsayed, Lars Schmidt-Thieme, Ahmed Rashed</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation models are crucial for next-item prediction tasks in various online platforms, yet many focus on a single behavior, neglecting valuable implicit interactions. While multi-behavioral models address this using graph-based approaches, they often fail to capture sequential patterns simultaneously. Our proposed Multi-Behavioral Sequential Recommendation framework (MBSRec) captures the multi-behavior dependencies between the heterogeneous historical interactions via multi-head self-attention. Furthermore, we utilize a weighted binary cross-entropy loss for precise behavior control. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate MBSRec’s significant outperformance of state-of-the-art approaches. The implementation code is available here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EGRQutc9xtVYbsbXswUcTb9nvT1Tc9cZ?usp=sharing) during the review and will be added to GitHub upon acceptance.</p>

    <h3>Improving Adversarial Robustness for Recommendation Model via Cross-Domain Distributional Adversarial Training (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Yang, Lilin Zhang, Jingyu Chen</p>
    <p>Recommendation models based on deep learning are fragile when facing adversarial examples (AE). Adversarial training (AT) is the existing mainstream method to promote the adversarial robustness of recommendation models. However, these AT methods often have two drawbacks. First, they may be ineffective due to the ubiquitous sparsity of interaction data. Second, point-wise perturbation used by these AT methods leads to suboptimal adversarial robustness, because not all examples are equally susceptible to such perturbations. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel method called Cross-domain Distributional Adversarial Training (CDAT) which utilizes a richer auxiliary domain to improve the adversarial robustness of a sparse target domain. CDAT comprises a Domain adversarial network (Dan) and a Cross-domain adversarial example generative network (Cdan). Dan learns a domain-invariant preference distribution which is obtained by aligning user embeddings from two domains and paves the way to leverage the knowledge from another domain for the target domain. Then, by adversarially perturbing the domain-invariant preference distribution under the guidance of a discriminator, Cdan captures an aggressive and imperceptible AE distribution. In this way, CDAT can transfer distributional adversarial robustness from the auxiliary domain to the target domain. The extensive experiments conducted on real datasets demonstrate the remarkable superiority of the proposed CDAT in improving the adversarial robustness of the sparse domain.</p>

    <h3>Discerning Canonical User Representation for Cross-Domain Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sherry Sahebi, Siqian Zhao</p>
    <p>Cross-domain recommender systems have emerged, to address the cold-start problem and enhance recommendation outcomes by leveraging information transfer across different domains. Existing cross-domain recommender systems have investigated the learning of both domain-specific and domain-shared user preferences to enhance recommendation performance. However, these models typically allow the disparities between shared and distinct user preferences to emerge freely in any space, lacking sufficient constraints to identify differences between two domains and ensure that both domains are considered simultaneously. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) has shown promise for transferring information between domains, by mapping their user representations into the same space. But, CCA only models domain similarities, and fails to capture the potential differences between user preferences in different domains. In this paper, we propose Discerning Canonical User Representation Learning for Cross-Domain Recommendation (DICUCDR), a generative adversarial networks (GAN) based method that learns both domain-shared and domain-specific user representations. DICUCDR introduces Discerning Canonical Correlation User Representation Learning (DCCRL), a novel design of non-linear Canonical Correlation mappings that creates a shared transformation for simultaneously mapping similarities between different domains and separating domain differences from domains. We compare DICUCDR against several state-of-the-art approaches using two real-world datasets. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of separately learning shared and specific user representations via DCCRL.</p>

    <h3>Repeated Padding for Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianzhe Zhao, Linying Jiang, Yuting Liu, Yizhou Dang, Xingwei Wang, Guibing Guo, Enneng Yang</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation aims to provide users with personalized suggestions based on their historical interactions. When training sequential models, padding is a widely adopted technique for two main reasons: 1) The vast majority of models can only handle fixed-length sequences; 2) Batch-based training needs to ensure that the sequences in each batch have the same length. The special value 0 is usually used as the padding content, which does not contain the actual information and is ignored in the model calculations. This common-sense padding strategy leads us to a problem that has never been explored in the recommendation field: Can we utilize this idle input space by padding other content to improve model performance and training efficiency further? In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective padding method called Repeated Padding (RepPad). Specifically, we use the original interaction sequences as the padding content and fill it to the padding positions during model training. This operation can be performed a finite number of times or repeated until the input sequences’ length reaches the maximum limit. Our RepPad can be considered as a sequence-level data augmentation strategy. Unlike most existing works, our method contains no trainable parameters or hyperparameters and is a plug-and-play data augmentation operation. Extensive experiments on various categories of sequential models and five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. The average recommendation performance improvement is up to 60.3% on GRU4Rec and 24.3% on SASRec. We also provide in-depth analysis and explanation of what makes RepPad effective from multiple perspectives. The source code will be released to ensure the complete reproducibility of our experiments.</p>

    <h3>From Clicks to Carbon: The Environmental Toll of Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Said, Tobias Vente, Lukas Wegmeth, Joeran Beel</p>
    <p>As global warming soars, evaluating the environmental impact of research is more critical now than ever before. However, we find that few to no recommender systems research papers document their impact on the environment. Consequently, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the environmental impact of recommender system research papers by reproducing a characteristic recommender systems experimental pipeline. We focus on estimating the carbon footprint of recommender systems research papers, highlighting the evolution of the environmental impact of recommender systems research experiments over time. We evaluated all 79 full papers from the ACM RecSys 2013 and 2023 conferences to analyze representative experimental pipelines for papers utilizing traditional, so-called good old-fashioned AI algorithms and deep learning algorithms, respectively. We reproduced these representative experimental pipelines, measured electricity consumption using a hardware energy meter, and converted the measured energy consumption into CO2 equivalents to estimate the environmental impact. Our results show that a recommender systems research paper utilizing deep learning algorithms emits approximately 42 times more CO2 equivalents than a paper utilizing traditional algorithms. Furthermore, such a paper produces, on average, 3,297 kilograms of CO2 equivalents, which is more than one person produces by flying from New York City to Melbourne or the amount one tree sequesters in 300 years.</p>

    <h3>Track Mix Generation on Music Streaming Services using Transformers (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Bouabça, Walid Bendada, Benjamin Chapus, Thibault Cador, Théo Bontempelli, Mathieu Morlon, Guillaume Salha-Galvan</p>
    <p>This paper introduces Track Mix, a personalized playlist generation system released in 2022 on the music streaming service Deezer. Track Mix automatically generates “mix” playlists inspired by initial music tracks, allowing users to discover music similar to their favorite content. To generate these mixes, we consider a Transformer model trained on millions of track sequences from user playlists. In light of the growing popularity of Transformers in recent years, we analyze the advantages, drawbacks, and technical challenges of using such a model for mix generation on the service, compared to a more traditional collaborative filtering approach. Since its release, Track Mix has been generating playlists for millions of users daily, enhancing their music discovery experience on Deezer.</p>

    <h3>Power Loss Function in Neural Networks for Predicting Click-Through Rate (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ergun Biçici</p>
    <p>Loss functions guide machine learning models towards concentrating on the error most important to improve upon.  We introduce power loss functions for neural networks and apply them on imbalanced click-through rate datasets. Power loss functions decrease the loss for confident predictions and increase the loss for error-prone predictions. They improve both AUC and F1 and produce better calibrated results.  We obtain improvements in the results on four different classifiers and on two different datasets. We obtain significant improvements in AUC that reach $0.44\%$ for DeepFM on the Avazu dataset.</p>

    <h3>Uncertainty-adjusted Inductive Matrix Completion with Graph Neural Networks (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Ledent, Petr Kasalicky, Rodrigo Alves</p>
    <p>We propose a robust recommender systems model which performs matrix completion and a ratings-wise uncertainty estimation jointly. Whilst the prediction module is purely based on an implicit low-rank assumption imposed via nuclear norm regularization, our loss function is augmented by an uncertainty estimation module which learns an anomaly score for each individual rating via a Graph Neural Network: data points deemed more anomalous by the GNN are downregulated in the loss function used to train the low-rank module. The whole model is trained in an end-to-end fashion, allowing the anomaly detection module to tap on the supervised information available in the form of ratings. Thus, our model’s predictors enjoy the favourable generalization properties that come with being chosen from small function space (i.e., low-rank matrices), whilst exhibiting the robustness to outliers and flexibility that comes with deep learning methods. Furthermore, the anomaly scores themselves contain valuable qualitative information. Experiments on various real-life datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms standard matrix completion and other baselines, confirming the usefulness of the anomaly detection module.</p>

    <h3>CR-SoRec: BERT driven Consistency Regularization for Social Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raksha Jalan, Naoyuki Onoe, Tushar Prakash, Brijraj Singh</p>
    <p>In the real world, when we seek our friends’ opinions on various items or events, we request verbal social recommendations. It has been observed that we often turn to our friends for recommendations on a daily basis. The emergence of online social platforms has enabled users to share their opinion with their social connections. Therefore, we should consider users’ social connections to enhance online recommendation performance. The social recommendation aims to fuse social links with user-item interactions to offer more relevant recommendations. Several efforts have been made to develop an effective social recommendation system. However, there are two significant limitations to current methods: First, they haven’t thoroughly explored the intricate relationships between the diverse influences of neighbours on users’ preferences. Second, existing models are vulnerable to overfitting due to the relatively low number of user-item interaction records in the interaction space. For the aforementioned problems,  this paper offers a novel framework called CR-SoRec, an effective recommendation model based on BERT and Consistency Regularization. This model incorporates Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer(BERT) to learn bidirectional context-aware user and item embeddings with neighbourhood sampling. The neighbourhood Sampling technique samples the most influential neighbours for all the users/ items. Further, to effectively use the available user-item interaction data and social ties, we leverage diverse perspectives via consistency regularisation to harness the underlying information. The main objective of our model is to predict the next item that a user would interact with based on its interaction behaviour and social connections. Experimental results show that our model defines a new state-of-the-art on various datasets and outperforms previous work by a significant margin. Extensive experiments are conducted to analyse the method. We release the source code of our model at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CR-SoRec-68F4</p>

    <h3>Alleviating the Long-Tail Problem in Conversational Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Cao, Kun Zhou, Fan Pan, Zhipeng Zhao, Xiaolei Wang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) aim to provide the recommendation service via natural language conversations. To develop an effective CRS, high-quality CRS datasets are very crucial. However, existing CRS datasets suffer from the long-tail issue, \ie a large proportion of items are rarely (or even never) mentioned in the conversations, which are called long-tail items. As a result, the CRSs trained on these datasets tend to recommend frequent items,  and the diversity of the recommended items would be largely reduced, making users easier to get bored. To address this issue, this paper presents <b>LOT-CRS</b>, a novel framework that focuses on simulating and utilizing a balanced CRS dataset (\ie covering all the items evenly) for improving <b>LO</b>ng-<b>T</b>ail recommendation performance of CRSs. In our approach, we design two pre-training tasks to enhance the understanding of simulated conversation for long-tail items, and adopt retrieval-augmented fine-tuning with label smoothness strategy to further improve the recommendation of long-tail items. Extensive experiments on two public CRS datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and extensibility of our approach, especially on long-tail recommendation. All the experimental codes will be released after the review period.</p>

    <h3>Knowledge-Aware Recommender Systems based on Multi-Modal Information Sources (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giuseppe Spillo</p>
    <p>The last few years saw a growing interest in Knowledge-Aware Recommender Systems (KARSs), given their capability in encoding and exploiting several data sources, both structured (such as <i>knowledge graphs</i>) and unstructured (such as plain text); indeed, several pieces of research show the competitiveness of these models. Nowadays, a lot of models at the state-of-the-art in KARSs use deep learning, enabling them to exploit large amounts of information, including knowledge graphs (KGs), user reviews, plain text, and multimedia content (pictures, audio, videos). In my Ph.D. I will explore and study techniques for designing KARSs leveraging embeddings deriving from multi-modal information sources; the models I will design will aim at providing fair, accurate, and explainable recommendations.</p>

    <h3>InTune: Reinforcement Learning-based Data Pipeline Optimization for Deep Recommendation Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Delgado, Kabir Nagrecha, Lingyi Liu, Prasanna Padmanabhan</p>
    <p>Deep learning-based recommendation models (DLRMs) have become an essential component of many modern recommender systems. Several companies are now building large compute clusters reserved only for DLRM training, driving new interest in cost- & time- saving optimizations. The systems challenges faced in this setting are unique; while typical deep learning (DL) training jobs are dominated by model execution times, the most important factor in DLRM training performance is often online data ingestion. In this paper, we explore the unique characteristics of this data ingestion problem and provide insights into the specific bottlenecks and challenges of the DLRM training pipeline at scale. We study real-world DLRM data processing pipelines taken from our compute cluster to both observe the performance impacts of online ingestion and to identify shortfalls in existing data pipeline optimizers. We find that current tooling either yields sub-optimal performance, frequent crashes, or else requires impractical cluster re-organization to adopt. Our studies lead us to design and build a new solution for data pipeline optimization, InTune. InTune employs a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to learn how to distribute CPU resources across a DLRM data pipeline to more effectively parallelize data-loading and improve throughput. Our experiments show that InTune can build an optimized data pipeline configuration within only a few minutes, and can easily be integrated into existing training workflows. By exploiting the responsiveness and adaptability of RL, InTune achieves significantly higher online data ingestion rates than existing optimizers, thus reducing idle times in model execution and increasing efficiency. We apply InTune to our real-world cluster, and find that it increases data ingestion throughput by as much as 2.29X versus current state-of-the-art data pipeline optimizers while also improving both CPU & GPU utilization.</p>

    <h3>MCM: A Multi-task Pre-trained Customer Model for Personalization (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianxin Wang, Peng Wan, Rui Luo, Jingyuan Deng</p>
    <p>Personalization plays a critical role in helping customers discover the products and contents they prefer for e-commerce stores.Personalized recommendations differ in contents, target customers, and UI. However, they require a common core capability – the ability to deeply understand customers’ preferences and shopping intents. In this paper, we introduce the MLCM (Multi-task Large pre-trained Customer Model), a large pre-trained BERT-based multi-task customer model with 10 million trainable parameters for e-commerce stores. This model aims to empower all personalization projects by providing commonly used preference scores for recommendations, customer embeddings for transfer learning, and a pre-trained model for fine-tuning. In this work, we improve the SOTA BERT4Rec framework to handle heterogeneous customer signals and multi-task training as well as innovate new data augmentation method that is suitable for recommendation task. Experimental results show that MLCM outperforms the original BERT4Rec by 17% on preference prediction tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that the model can be easily fine-tuned to assist a specific recommendation task. For instance, after fine-tuning MLCM for an incentive based recommendation project, performance improves by 60% on the conversion prediction task and 25% on the click-through prediction task compared to the production baseline model.</p>

    <h3>Multiple Connectivity Views for Session-based Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Miao, Yujing Wang, Yaming Yang, Jieyu Zhang, Yunhai Tong</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendation (SBR), which makes the next-item recommendation based on previous anonymous actions, has drawn increasing attention. The last decade has seen multiple deep learning-based modeling choices applied on SBR successfully, e.g., recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and each modeling choice has its intrinsic superiority and limitation. We argue that these modeling choices differentiate from each other by (1) the way they capture the interactions between items within a session and (2) the operators they adopt for composing the neural network, e.g., convolutional operator or self-attention operator. In this work, we dive deep into the former as it is relatively unique to the SBR scenario, while the latter is shared by general neural network modeling techniques. We first introduce the concept of connectivity view to describe the different item interaction patterns at the input level. Then, we develop the Multiple Connectivity Views for Session-based Recommendation (MCV-SBR), a unified framework that incorporates different modeling choices in a single model through the lens of connectivity view. In addition, MCV-SBR allows us to effectively and efficiently explore the search space of the combinations of connectivity views by the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator Approach (TPE) algorithm. Finally, on three widely used SBR datasets, we verify the superiority of MCV-SBR by comparing the searched models with state-of-the-art baselines. We also conduct a series of studies to demonstrate the efficacy and practicability of the proposed connectivity view search algorithm, as well as other components in MCV-SBR.</p>

    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minmin Chen, Yi Su</p>
    <p>The paradigm of framing recommendations as (sequential) decision-making processes has gained significant interest. To achieve long-term user satisfaction, these interactive systems need to strikes a balance between exploitation (recommending high-reward items) and exploration (exploring uncertain regions for potentially better items). Classical bandit algorithms like Upper-Confidence-Bound and Thompson Sampling, and their contextual extensions with linear payoffs have exhibited strong theoretical guarantees and empirical success in managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Building efficient exploration-based systems for deep neural network powered real-world, large-scale industrial recommender systems remains under studied. In addition, these systems are often multi-stage, multi-objective and response time sensitive.  In this talk, we share our experience in addressing these challenges in building exploration based industrial recommender systems. Specifically, we adopt the Neural Linear Bandit algorithm, which effectively combines the representation power of deep neural networks, with the simplicity of linear bandits to incorporate exploration in DNN based recommender systems. We introduce  exploration capability to both the nomination and ranking stage of the industrial recommender system.  In the context of the ranking stage, we delve into the extension of this algorithm to accommodate the multi-task setup, enabling exploration in systems with multiple objectives. Moving on to the nomination stage, we will address the development of efficient bandit algorithms tailored to factorized bi-linear models. These algorithms play a crucial role in facilitating maximum inner product search, which is commonly employed in large-scale retrieval systems. We validate our algorithms and present findings from real-world live experiments.</p>
