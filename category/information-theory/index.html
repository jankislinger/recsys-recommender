    <h3>Information-Controllable Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixuan Yang, Zirui Guo, Yanhua Yu, Liang Pang, Tat-Seng Chua, Kangkang Lu, Yuling Wang</p>
    <p>In the evolving landscape of recommender systems, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has become a prominent method for enhancing recommendation performance by alleviating the issue of data sparsity. However, existing GCL-based recommendations often overlook the control of shared information between the contrastive views. In this paper, we initially analyze and experimentally demonstrate these methods often lead to the issue of augmented representation collapse, where the representations between views become excessively similar, diminishing their distinctiveness. To address this issue, we propose the Information-Controllable Graph Contrastive Learning (IGCL) framework, a novel approach that focuses on optimizing the shared information between views to include as much relevant information for the recommendation task as possible while maintaining an appropriate level. In particular, we design the Collaborative Signals Enhanced Augmentation module to infuse the augmented representation with rich, task-relevant collaborative signals. Furthermore, the Information-Controllable Contrastive Learning module is designed to direct control over the magnitude of shared information between the contrastive views to avoid over-similarity. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IGCL, showcasing significant improvements in performance and the capability to alleviate augmented representation collapse.</p>

    <h3>OutRank: Speeding up AutoML-based Model Search for Large Sparse Data sets with Cardinality-aware Feature Ranking (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Blaž Škrlj, Blaž Mramor</p>
    <p>The design of modern recommender systems relies on understanding which parts of the feature space are relevant for solving a given recommendation task. However, real-world data sets in this domain are often characterized by their large size, sparsity, and noise, making it challenging to identify meaningful signals. Feature ranking represents an efficient branch of algorithms that can help address these challenges by identifying the most informative features and facilitating the automated search for more compact and better-performing models (AutoML). We introduce OutRank, a system for versatile feature ranking and data quality-related anomaly detection. OutRank was built with categorical data in mind, utilizing a variant of mutual information that is normalized with regard to the noise produced by features of the same cardinality. We further extend the similarity measure by incorporating information on feature similarity and combined relevance. The proposed approach’s feasibility is demonstrated by speeding up the state-of-the-art AutoML system on a synthetic data set with no performance loss. Furthermore, we considered a real-life click-through-rate prediction data set where it outperformed strong baselines such as random forest-based approaches. The proposed approach enables exploration of up to 300% larger feature spaces compared to AutoML-only approaches, enabling faster search for better models on off-the-shelf hardware.</p>
