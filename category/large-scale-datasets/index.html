    <h3>A Multimodal Single-Branch Embedding Network for Recommendation in Cold-Start and Missing Modality Scenarios (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Hausberger, Markus Schedl, Christian Ganhör, Shah Nawaz, Marta Moscati</p>
    <p>Most recommender systems adopt collaborative filtering (CF) and provide recommendations based on past collective interactions. Therefore, the performance of CF algorithms degrades when few or no interactions are available, a scenario referred to as cold-start. To address this issue, previous work relies on models leveraging both collaborative data and side information on the users or items. Similar to multimodal learning, these models aim at combining collaborative and content representations in a shared embedding space. In this work we propose a novel technique for multimodal recommendation, relying on a multimodal Single-Branch embedding network for Recommendation (SiBraR). Leveraging weight-sharing, SiBraR encodes interaction data as well as multimodal side information using the same single-branch embedding network on different modalities. This makes SiBraR effective in scenarios of missing modality, including cold start. Our extensive experiments on large-scale recommendation datasets from three different recommendation domains (music, movie, and e-commerce) and providing multimodal content information (audio, text, image, labels, and interactions) show that SiBraR significantly outperforms CF as well as state-of-the-art content-based RSs in cold-start scenarios, and is competitive in warm scenarios. We show that SiBraR’s recommendations are accurate in missing modality scenarios, and that the model is able to map different modalities to the same region of the shared embedding space, hence reducing the modality gap.</p>

    <h3>Collaborative filtering algorithms are prone to mainstream-taste bias (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Hager, Pantelis Analytis</p>
    <p>Collaborative filtering has been the main steam engine of the recommender systems community since the early 1990s. Collaborative filtering (and other) algorithms, however, have been predominantly evaluated by aggregating results across users or user groups. These performance averages hide large disparities: an algorithm may perform very well for some users (or groups) and very poorly for others. We show that performance variation is large and systematic. In experiments on three large scale datasets and using an array of collaborative filtering algorithms, we demonstrate the large performance disparities for different users across algorithms and datasets. We then show that performance variation is systematic and that two key features that characterize users, their mean taste similarity with other users and the dispersion in taste similarity, can explain performance variation better than previously identified features. We use these two features to visualize algorithm performance for different users, and point out that this mapping can be used to capture different categories of users that have been proposed before. Our results demonstrate an extensive mainstream-taste bias in all collaborative filtering algorithms, and they imply a fundamental fairness limitation that needs to be mitigated.</p>

    <h3>Understanding and Modeling Passive-Negative Feedback for Short-video Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Gao, Yong Li, Depeng Jin, Yunzhu Pan, Kun Gai, Yang Song</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation is one of the most important tasks in recommender systems, which aims to recommend the next interacted item with historical behaviors as input. Traditional sequential recommendation always mainly considers the collected positive feedback such as click, purchase, etc. However, in short-video platforms such as TikTok, video viewing behavior may not always represent positive feedback. Specifically, the videos are played automatically, and users passively receive the recommended videos. In this new scenario, users passively express negative feedback by skipping over videos they do not like, which provides valuable information about their preferences. Different from the negative feedback studied in traditional recommender systems, this passive-negative feedback can reflect users’ interests and serve as an important supervision signal in extracting users’ preferences. Therefore, it is essential to carefully design and utilize it in this novel recommendation scenario. In this work, we first conduct analyses based on a large-scale real-world short-video behavior dataset and illustrate the significance of leveraging passive feedback. We then propose a novel method that deploys the sub-interest encoder, which incorporates positive feedback and passive-negative feedback as supervision signals to learn the user’s current active sub-interest. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive fusion layer to integrate various sub-interests effectively. To enhance the robustness of our model, we then introduce a multi-task learning module to simultaneously optimize two kinds of feedback – passive-negative feedback and traditional randomly-sampled negative feedback. The experiments on two large-scale datasets verify that the proposed method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches. The codes and collected datasets are anonymously released at https:// anonymous.4open.science/ r/ SINE-2047/ to benefit the community.</p>

    <h3>Deep Generative Ranking for Personalized Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huafeng Liu, Jingxuan Wen, Jian Yu, Liping Jing</p>
    <p>Recommender systems offer critical services in the age of mass information. Personalized ranking have been attractive both for content providers and customers due to its ability of creating a user-specific ranking on the item set. Although the powerful factor-analysis methods including latent factor model and deep neural network models have achieved promising results, they still suffer from the challenging issues, such as sparsity of recommendation data, uncertainty of optimization, and etc. To enhance the accuracy and generalization of recommender system, in this paper, we propose a deep generative ranking (DGR) model under the Wasserstein auto-encoder framework. Specifically, DGR simultaneously generates the pointwise implicit feedback data (via a Beta-Bernoulli distribution) and creates the pairwise ranking list by sufficient exploiting both interacted and non-interacted items for each user. DGR can be efficiently inferred by minimizing its penalized evidence lower bound. Meanwhile, we theoretically analyze the generalization error bounds of DGR model to guarantee its performance in extremely sparse feedback data. A series of experiments on four large-scale datasets (Movielens (20M), Netflix, Epinions and Yelp in movie, product and business domains) have been conducted. By comparing with the state-of-the-art methods, the experimental results demonstrate that DGR consistently benefit the recommendation system in ranking estimation task, especially for the near-cold-start-users (with less than five interacted items).</p>
