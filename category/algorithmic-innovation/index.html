    <h3>Distillation Matters: Empowering Sequential  Recommenders to Match the Performance of Large Language Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiawei Chen, Yi Wan, Heng Tang, Bohao Wang, Feng Liu, Pengbo Wang, Jun Wang, Yu Cui</p>
    <p>Owing to their powerful semantic reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been effectively utilized as recommenders, achieving impressive performance. However, the high inference latency of LLMs significantly restricts their practical deployment. To address this issue, this work investigates knowledge distillation from cumbersome LLM-based recommendation models to lightweight conventional sequential models. It encounters three challenges: 1) the teacher’s knowledge may not always be reliable; 2) the capacity gap between the teacher and student makes it difficult for the student to assimilate the teacher’s knowledge; 3) divergence in semantic space poses a challenge to distill the knowledge from embeddings. To tackle these challenges, this work proposes a novel distillation strategy, DLLM2Rec, specifically tailored for knowledge distillation from LLM-based recommendation models to conventional sequential models. DLLM2Rec comprises: 1) Importance-aware ranking distillation, which filters reliable and student-friendly knowledge by weighting instances according to teacher confidence and student-teacher consistency; 2)  Collaborative embedding distillation integrates knowledge from teacher embeddings with collaborative signals mined from the data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DLLM2Rec, boosting three typical sequential models with an average improvement of 47.97%, even enabling them to surpass LLM-based recommenders in some cases.</p>

    <h3>Fast and Examination-agnostic Reciprocal Recommendation in Matching Markets (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoji Tomita, Riku Togashi, Yuriko Hashizume, Naoto Ohsaka</p>
    <p>n matching markets such as job posting and online dating platforms, the recommender system plays a critical role in the success of the platform. Unlike standard recommender systems that suggest items to users, reciprocal recommender systems (RRSs) that suggest other users must take into account the mutual interests of users. In addition, ensuring that recommendation opportunities do not disproportionately favor popular users is essential for the total number of matches and for fairness among users. Existing recommendation methods in matching markets, however, face computational challenges on large-scale platforms and depend on specific examination functions in the position-based model (PBM). In this paper, we introduce the reciprocal recommendation method based on the matching with transferable utility (TU matching) model in the context of ranking recommendations in matching markets and propose a fast and examination-model-free algorithm. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach on experiments with synthetic data and real-world data from an online dating platform in Japan. Our method performs better than or as well as existing methods in terms of the number of total matches and works well even in a large-scale dataset for which one existing method does not work.</p>

    <h3>Burst-induced Multi-Armed Bandit for Learning Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrigo Alves, Antoine Ledent, Marius Kloft</p>
    <p>In this paper, we introduce a non-stationary and context-free Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem and a novel algorithm (which we refer to as BMAB) to solve it. The problem is context-free in the sense that no side information about users or items is needed. We work in a continuous-time setting where each timestamp corresponds to a visit by a user and a corresponding decision regarding recommendation. The main novelty is that we model the reward distribution as a consequence of variations in the intensity of the activity, and thereby we assist the exploration/exploitation dilemma by exploring the temporal dynamics of the audience. To achieve this, we assume that the recommendation procedure can be split into two different states: the loyal and the curious state. We identify the current state by modelling the events as a mixture of two Poisson processes, one for each of the possible states. We further assume that the loyal audience is associated with a single stationary reward distribution, but each bursty period comes with its own reward distribution. We test our algorithm and compare it to several baselines in two strands of experiments: synthetic data simulations and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that BMAB achieves competitive results when compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>
