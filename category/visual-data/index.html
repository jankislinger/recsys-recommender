    <h3>Complementary Product Recommendation for Long-tail Products (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rastislav Papso</p>
    <p>Identifying complementary relations between products plays a key role in e-commerce Recommender Systems (RS). Existing methods in Complementary Product Recommendation (CPR), however, focus only on identifying complementary relations in huge and data-rich catalogs, while none of them considers real-world scenarios of small and medium e-commerce platforms with limited number of interactions. In this paper, we discuss our research proposal that addresses the problem of identifying complementary relations in such sparse settings. To overcome the data sparsity problem, we propose to first learn complementary relations in large and data-rich catalogs and then transfer learned knowledge to small and scarce ones. To be able to map individual products across different catalogs and thus transfer learned relations between them, we propose to create Product Universal Embedding Space (PUES) using textual and visual product meta-data, which serves as a common ground for the products from arbitrary catalog.</p>

    <h3>Eliciting the Usersâ€™ Unknown Preferences (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Neidhardt, Hannes Werthner, Leonhard Seyfang, Rainer Schuster</p>
    <p>Personalized recommendation strongly relies on an accurate model to capture user preferences; eliciting this information is, in general, a hard problem. In the field of tourism this initial profiling becomes even more challenging. It has been shown that particularly in the beginning of the travel decision making process, users themselves are often not conscious of their needs and are not able to express them. In this paper, the basics of a picture-based approach are introduced that aims at revealing implicitly given user preferences. Based on a set of travel related pictures selected by a user, an individual travel profile is deduced. This is accomplished by mapping those pictures onto seven basic factors that reflect different travel behavioral aspects. Also tourism products can be represented by this simple seven factor model. Thus, this model constitutes the basis of our recommendation algorithm. In addition, users experience this non-verbal way of interaction as exiting and inspiring.</p>
