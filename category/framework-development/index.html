    <h3>Reproducibility of LLM-based Recommender Systems: the case study of P5 paradigm (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Polignano, Cataldo Musto, Giovanni Semeraro, Pasquale Lops, Antonio Silletti</p>
    <p>Recommender systems field may greatly benefit of the availability of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs), which can serve as the core mechanism to generate recommendations based on detailed user and item data, such as textual descriptions, user reviews, and metadata.  On one hand this new generation of LLM-based recommender systems paves the way to deal with traditional limitations, such as cold-start and data sparsity, but on the other hand this poses fundamental challenges for their accountability.  Reproducing experiments in the new context of LLM-based recommender systems is very challenging for several reasons. New approaches are published at an unprecedented pace, which makes difficult to have a clear picture of the main protocols and good practices in the experimental evaluation. Moreover, the lack of proper frameworks for LLM-based recommendation development and evaluation makes the process of benchmarking models complex and uncertain. In this work, we discuss the main issues encountered when trying to reproduce P5 (Pretrain, Personalized Prompt, and Prediction Paradigm), one of the first works unifying different recommendation tasks in a shared language modeling and natural language generation framework.  Starting from this study, we have developed OurFramework4LLM (anonymized name), a framework for training and evaluating LLMs, specifically for the recommendation task. It has been used to perform several experiments to assess the impact of different LLMs, personalization and novel set of more informative prompts on the overall performance of recommendations, in a fully reproducible environment.</p>

    <h3>EasyStudy: Framework for Easy Deployment of User Studies on Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ladislav Peska, Patrik Dokoupil</p>
    <p>Improvements in the recommender systems (RS) domain are not possible without a thorough way to evaluate and compare newly proposed approaches. User studies represent a viable alternative to online and offline evaluation schemes, but despite their numerous benefits, they are only rarely used. One of the main reasons behind this fact is that preparing a user study from scratch involves a lot of extra work on top of a simple algorithm proposal.  To simplify this task, we propose \textsc{EasyStudy}, a modular framework built on the credo “<i>Make simple things fast and hard things possible</i>”. It features ready-to-use datasets, preference elicitation methods, incrementally tuned baseline algorithms, study flow plugins, and evaluation metrics. As a result, a simple study comparing several RS can be deployed with just a few clicks, while more complex study designs can still benefit from a range of reusable components, such as preference elicitation. Overall, \textsc{EasyStudy} dramatically decreases the gap between the laboriousness of offline evaluation vs. user studies and, therefore, may contribute towards the more reliable and insightful user-centric evaluation of next-generation RS.</p>

    <h3>DRecPy: A Python Framework for Developing Deep Learning-Based Recommenders (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Márcia Barros, Francisco M. Couto, Fábio Colaço</p>
    <p>Frameworks that aid the development of Recommender Systems (RSs) are extremely important, since they reduce their development cost by offering reusable tools, as well as implementations of common strategies and popular models. However, it is still hard to find a framework that also provides full abstraction over data set conversion, support for deep learning-based approaches, extensible models and reproducible evaluations. This work introduces a new framework that not only provides several modules to avoid repetitive development work, but also to assist practitioners with these existing challenges. Our evaluation procedure ensures that RSs developed using this new approach are consistent and extensible, by analysing their predictive performance and certain characteristics of their implementation.</p>

    <h3>Users in the Loop: A Psychologically-Informed Approach to Similar Item Retrieval (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amy A. Winecoff, Matthew Graham, Florin Brasoveanu, Pearce Washabaugh, Bryce Casavant</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RS) often leverage information about the similarity between items’ features to make recommendations. Yet, many commonly used similarity functions make mathematical assumptions such as symmetry (i.e., Sim(a,b) = Sim(b,a)) that are inconsistent with how humans make similarity judgments. Moreover, most algorithm validations either do not directly measure users’ behavior or fail to comply with methodological standards for psychological research. RS that are developed and evaluated without regard to users’ psychology may fail to meet users’ needs. To provide recommendations that do meet the needs of users, we must: 1) develop similarity functions that account for known properties of human cognition, and 2) rigorously evaluate the performance of these functions using methodologically sound user testing. Here, we develop a framework for evaluating users’ judgments of similarity that is informed by best practices in psychological research methods. Employing users’ fashion item similarity judgments collected using our framework, we demonstrate that a psychologically-informed similarity function (i.e., Tversky contrast model) outperforms a psychologically-naive similarity function (i.e., Jaccard similarity) in predicting users’ similarity judgments.</p>

    <h3>Towards an Open, Collaborative REST API for Recommender Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Bellogin, Iván García</p>
    <p>Recommender Systems aim to suggest relevant items to users, however, for this they need to properly obtain/serve different types of data from/to the users of such systems. In this work, we propose and show an example implementation for a common REST API focused on Recommender Systems. This API meets the most typical requirements faced by Recommender Systems practitioners while, at the same time, is open and flexible to be extended, based on the feedback from the community. We also present a Web client that demonstrates the functionalities of the proposed API.</p>

    <h3>Recommendations with a Purpose (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Gediminas Adomavicius</p>
    <p>The purpose of recommenders is often summarized as “help the users find relevant items”, and the predominant operationalization of this goal has been to focus on the ability to numerically estimate the users’ preferences for unseen items or to provide users with item lists ranked in accordance to the estimated preferences. This dominant, albeit narrow, view of the recommendation problem has been tremendously helpful in advancing research in different ways, e.g., through the establishment of standardized evaluation procedures and metrics. In reality, recommender systems can serve a variety of purposes from the point of view of both consumers and providers. Most of the purposes, however, are significantly underexplored, even though many of them are arguably more aligned with the real-world expectations for recommenders than our current predominant paradigm. Therefore, it is important to revisit our conceptualizations of the potential goals of recommenders and their operationalization as research problems. In this paper, we discuss a framework of recommendation goals and purposes and highlight possible future directions and challenges related to the operationalization of such alternative problem formulations.</p>

    <h3>Coverage, Redundancy and Size-Awareness in Genre Diversity for Recommender Systems (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saul Vargas, Pablo Castells, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Linas Baltrunas</p>
    <p>There is increasing awareness in the Recommender Systems field that diversity is as a key property that enhances the usefulness of recommendations. Genre information can serve as a means to measure and enhance the diversity of recommendations and is readily available in domains such as movies, music or books. In this work we propose a new Binomial framework for defining genre diversity in recommender systems that takes into account three key properties: genre coverage, genre redundancy and recommendation list size-awareness. We show that methods previously proposed for measuring and enhancing recommendation diversity -including those adapted from search result diversification- fail to address adequately these three properties. We also propose an efficient greedy optimization technique to optimize Binomial diversity. Experiments with the Netflix dataset show the properties of our framework and comparison with state of the art methods.</p>
