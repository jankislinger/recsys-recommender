    <h3>Scale-Invariant Learning-to-Rank (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ye-Sheen Lim, Alessio Petrozziello, Xiaoke Liu, Christian Sommeregger</p>
    <p>At Expedia, learning-to-rank (LTR) models plays a key role on our website in sorting and presenting information more relevant to users, such as search filters, property rooms, amenities, and images. A major challenge in deploying these models is ensuring consistent feature scaling between training and production data, as discrepancies can lead to unreliable rankings when deployed. Normalization techniques like feature standardization and batch normalization could address these issues but are impractical in production due to latency impacts and the difficulty of distributed real-time inference. To address consistent feature scaling issue, we introduce a scale-invariant LTR framework which combines a deep and a wide neural network to mathematically guarantee scale-invariance in the model at both training and prediction time.</p>

    <h3>Recommender Systems for Personalized User Experience: Lessons learned at Booking.com (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Kangas</p>
    <p>Booking.com is the world’s leading online travel platform where users make many decisions supported by our recommendations, such as destinations, travel dates, facilities, etc. This leads to a complex User Interface (UI) containing many widgets of different relevance for different users. We address the problem of constructing an optimal UI, a non-trivial problem, mainly due to user preferences evolving over time and multiple independent teams collaboratively building the UI. Our goal is to provide a personalized User Experience (UX) which adapts to changes in the environment and ensures governable, collaborative product development. The solution relies on a Multi Armed Bandits (MAB) framework currently allowing product teams to collaborate on the construction of UIs and serving millions of users every day. We present examples of our solution and lessons learned during their implementation.</p>

    <h3>Free Lunch! Retrospective Uplift Modeling for Dynamic Promotions Recommendation within ROI Constraints (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Albert, Lucas Bernardi, Pablo Estevez, Dmitri Goldenberg</p>
    <p>Promotions and discounts have become key components of modern e-commerce platforms. For online travel platforms (OTPs), popular promotions include room upgrades, free meals and transportation services. By offering these promotions, customers can get more value for their money, while both the OTP and its travel partners may grow their loyal customer base. However, the promotions usually incur a cost that, if uncontrolled, can become unsustainable. Consequently, for a promotion to be viable, its associated costs must be balanced by incremental revenue within set financial constraints. Personalized treatment assignment can be used to satisfy such constraints. This paper introduces a novel uplift modeling technique, relying on the Knapsack Problem formulation, that dynamically optimizes the incremental treatment’s outcome subject to the required Return on Investment (ROI) constraints. The technique leverages Retrospective Estimation, a modeling approach that relies solely on data from positive outcome examples. The method also addresses training data bias, long term effects, and seasonality challenges via online-dynamic calibration. This approach was tested via offline experiments and online randomized controlled trials at Booking.com - a leading OTP with millions of customers worldwide, resulting in a significant increase in the target outcome while staying within the required financial constraints and outperforming other approaches.</p>

    <h3>How Long to Stay Where? On the Amount of Item Consumption in Travel Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wolfgang Wörndl, Linus W. Dietz</p>
    <p>Recommender systems could benefit from not only recommending the most fitting items, but also in what quantity the user should consume them. For example, a personalized travel recommender system could indicate not just which city one should travel to, but also how much time to spend there. We present a data-driven solution to this problem based on mining trips from location-based social networks. To determine the recommended duration of stay at a destination, we consider how long travelers typically stay at different cities and how much time the current user generally spends visiting cities.</p>

    <h3>Users’ Choices About Hotel Booking: Cues for Personalizing the Presentation of Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Catalin-Mihai Barbu, Jürgen Ziegler</p>
    <p>Personalization in recommender systems has typically been applied to the underlying algorithms. In contrast, the presentation of individual recommendations—specifically, the various ways in which it can be adapted to suit the user’s needs in a more effective manner—has received relatively little attention by comparison. We present the results of an exploratory survey about users’ choices regarding hotel recommendations and draw preliminary conclusions about whether these choices can influence the presentation of recommendations.</p>

    <h3>How to Interpret Implicit User Feedback? (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Vojtas, Ladislav Peska</p>
    <p>Our research is focused on interpreting user preference from his/her implicit behavior. There are many types of relevant behavior e.g. time on page, scrolling, clickstream etc. which we will further denote as (RBT). RBT s varies both in quality and incidence and thus we might need different approaches to process them. In this early work we focus on how to derive user preference from each RBT separately. We selected number of common indicators, design two novel e-commerce specific RBT interpreting methods and conducted series of offline experiments. After the off-line evaluation an A/B test on the real-world users of a travel agency was conducted comparing best off-line method with simple binary feedback. The experiments, although preliminary, showed importance of considering multiple RBTs together.</p>
