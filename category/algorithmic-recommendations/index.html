    <h3>Fair Reciprocal Recommendation in Matching Markets (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoji Tomita, Tomohiko Yokoyama</p>
    <p>Recommender systems play an increasingly crucial role in shaping people’s opportunities, particularly in online dating platforms. It is essential from the user’s perspective to increase the probability of matching with a suitable partner while ensuring an appropriate level of fairness in the matching opportunities. We investigate reciprocal recommendation in two-sided matching markets between agents divided into two sides (e.g., men and women). We assume that a successful match requires mutual interest from both men and women involved, and agents would desire to be positioned favorably in the others’ the recommendation lists. We define each agent’s opportunity to be recommended and introduce its fairness criterion, envy-freeness, from the perspective of the fair division theory. The recommendations that approximately maximize the expected number of matches between men and women, empirically obtained by heuristic algorithms, are likely to result in significant unfairness of opportunity. Therefore, there can be a trade-off between maximizing the expected matches and ensuring fairness of opportunity. We propose a method to find a policy that is close to being envy-free by leveraging the Nash social welfare function. Experiments on synthetic and a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving both relatively high expected matches and fairness for opportunities of both men and women in reciprocal recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Doubly Robust Estimator for Ranking Metrics with Post-Click Conversions (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuta Saito</p>
    <p>Post-click conversion, a pre-defined action on a web service after a click, is an essential form of feedback, as it directly contributes to the final revenue and accurately captures user preferences for items, compared with the ambiguous click. However, naively using post-click conversions can lead to severe bias when learning or evaluating recommenders because of the selection bias between clicked and unclicked data. In this study, we address the offline evaluation problem of algorithmic recommendations with biased post-click conversions. A possible solution to address this bias is to use the inverse propensity score estimator, as it can provide an unbiased evaluation even with the selection bias. However, this estimator is known to be subject to variance and instability problems, which can be severe in the recommendation setting, as feedback is often highly sparse. To address these limitations with the previous unbiased estimator, we propose a doubly robust estimator for the ground-truth ranking performance of a given recommender. The proposed estimator is unbiased against the ground-truth ranking metric and improves the variance and estimation error tail bound of the existing unbiased estimator. Finally, to evaluate the empirical efficacy of the proposed estimator, we conduct empirical evaluations using semi-synthetic and two public real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed metric reveals a better model evaluation performance compared with existing baseline metrics, particularly in a situation with severe selection bias.</p>

    <h3>Deconstructing the Filter Bubble: User Decision-Making and Recommender Systems (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Duarte Goncalves, Guy Aridor, Shan Sikdar</p>
    <p>We study a model of user decision-making in the context of recommender systems via numerical simulation. Our model provides an explanation for the findings of Nguyen, et. al (2014), where, in environments where recommender systems are typically deployed, users consume increasingly similar items over time even without recommendation. We find that recommendation alleviates these natural filter-bubble effects, but that it also leads to an increase in homogeneity across users, resulting in a trade-off between homogenizing across-user consumption and diversifying within-user consumption. Finally, we discuss how our model highlights the importance of collecting data on user beliefs and their evolution over time both to design better recommendations and to further understand their impact.</p>
