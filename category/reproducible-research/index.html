    <h3>DRecPy: A Python Framework for Developing Deep Learning-Based Recommenders (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Márcia Barros, Francisco M. Couto, Fábio Colaço</p>
    <p>Frameworks that aid the development of Recommender Systems (RSs) are extremely important, since they reduce their development cost by offering reusable tools, as well as implementations of common strategies and popular models. However, it is still hard to find a framework that also provides full abstraction over data set conversion, support for deep learning-based approaches, extensible models and reproducible evaluations. This work introduces a new framework that not only provides several modules to avoid repetitive development work, but also to assist practitioners with these existing challenges. Our evaluation procedure ensures that RSs developed using this new approach are consistent and extensible, by analysing their predictive performance and certain characteristics of their implementation.</p>

    <h3>Are We Evaluating Rigorously? Benchmarking Recommendation for Reproducible Evaluation and Fair Comparison (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhu Sun, Jie Zhang, Di Yu, Xinghua Qu, Hui Fang, Jie Yang, Cong Geng</p>
    <p>With tremendous amount of recommendation algorithms proposed every year, one critical issue has attracted a considerable amount of attention: there are no effective benchmarks for evaluation, which leads to two major concerns, i.e., unreproducible evaluation and unfair comparison. This paper aims to conduct rigorous (i.e., reproducible and fair) evaluation for implicit-feedback based top-N recommendation algorithms. We first systematically review 85 recommendation papers published at eight top-tier conferences (e.g., RecSys, SIGIR) to summarize important evaluation factors, e.g., data splitting and parameter tuning strategies, etc. Through a holistic empirical study, the impacts of different factors on recommendation performance are then analyzed in-depth. Following that, we create benchmarks with standardized procedures and provide the performance of seven well-tuned state-of-the-arts across six metrics on six widely-used datasets as a reference for later study. Additionally, we release a user-friendly Python toolkit, which differs from existing ones in addressing the broad scope of rigorous evaluation for recommendation. Overall, our work sheds light on the issues in recommendation evaluation and lays the foundation for further investigation. Our code and datasets are available at GitHub (https://github.com/AmazingDD/daisyRec).</p>
