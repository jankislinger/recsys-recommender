    <h3>Embedding based retrieval for long tail search queries in ecommerce (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arun Udayashankar, Yuyang Zhang, Akshay Kekuda</p>
    <p>In this abstract we present a series of optimizations we performed on the two-tower model architecture [14], and training and evaluation datasets to implement semantic product search at Best Buy. Search queries on bestbuy.com follow the pareto distribution whereby a minority of them account for most searches. This leaves us with a long tail of search queries that have low frequency of issuance. The queries in the long tail suffer from very spare interaction signals. Our current work focuses on building a model to serve the long tail queries. We present a series of optimizations we have done to this model to maximize conversion for the purpose of retrieval from the catalog. The first optimization we present is using a large language model to improve the sparsity of conversion signals. The second optimization is pretraining an off-the-shelf transformer-based model on the Best Buy catalog data. The third optimization we present is on the finetuning front. We use query-to-query pairs in addition to query-to-product pairs and combining the above strategies for finetuning the model. We also demonstrate how merging the weights of these finetuned models improves the evaluation metrics. Finally, we provide a recipe for curating an evaluation dataset for continuous monitoring of model performance with human-in-the-loop evaluation. We found that adding this recall mechanism to our current term match-based recall improved conversion by 3% in an online A/B test.</p>

    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tri Kurniawan Wijaya, Gabor Fodor, Edoardo D’Amico, Manuel V. Loureiro</p>
    <p>Rs4rs is a web application designed to perform semantic search on recent papers from top conferences and journals related to Recommender Systems. Current scholarly search engine tools like Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and ResearchGate often yield broad results that fail to target the most relevant high-quality publications. Moreover, manually visiting individual conference and journal websites is a time-consuming process that primarily supports only syntactic searches. Rs4rs addresses these issues by providing a user-friendly platform where researchers can input their topic of interest and receive a list of recent, relevant papers from top Recommender Systems venues. Utilizing semantic search techniques, Rs4rs ensures that the search results are not only precise and relevant but also comprehensive, capturing papers regardless of<br>variations in wording.

    <h3>Uncovering ChatGPT’s Capabilities in Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihua Si, Chen Xu, Haiyuan Zhao, Xiao Zhang, Weijie Yu, Zhongxiang Sun, Jun Xu, Ninglu Shao, Sunhao Dai</p>
    <p>The debut of ChatGPT has recently attracted significant attention from the natural language processing (NLP) community and beyond. Existing studies have demonstrated that ChatGPT shows significant improvement in a range of downstream NLP tasks, but the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in terms of recommendations remain unclear. In this study, we aim to enhance ChatGPT’s recommendation capabilities by aligning it with traditional information retrieval (IR) ranking capabilities, including point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise ranking. To achieve this goal, we re-formulate the aforementioned three recommendation policies into prompt formats tailored specifically to the domain at hand.  Through extensive experiments on four datasets from different domains, we analyze the distinctions among the three recommendation policies. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT achieves an optimal balance between cost and performance when equipped with list-wise ranking. This research sheds light on a promising direction for aligning ChatGPT with recommendation tasks.

    <h3>Optimizing Podcast Discovery: Unveiling Amazon Music’s Retrieval and Ranking Framework (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Greyson, Geetha Aluri, Joaquin Delgado</p>
    <p>This work presents the search architecture of Amazon Music, which is a highly efficient system designed to retrieve relevant content for users. The architecture consists of three key stages: indexing, retrieval, and ranking. During the indexing stage, data is meticulously parsed and processed to create a comprehensive index that contains dense representations and essential information about each document (such as a music or podcast entity) in the collection, including its title, metadata, and relevant attributes. This indexing process enables fast and efficient data access during retrieval. The retrieval stage utilizes multi-faceted retrieval strategies, resulting in improved identification of candidate matches compared to traditional structured search methods. Subsequently, candidates are ranked based on their relevance to the customer’s query, taking into account document features and personalized factors. With a specific focus on the podcast use case, this paper highlights the deployment of the architecture and demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing podcast search capabilities, providing tailored and engaging content experiences.</p>

    <h3>Learning to Match Job Candidates Using Multilingual Bi-Encoder BERT (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dor Lavi</p>
    <p>Randstad is the global leader in the HR services industry. We support people and organizations in realizing their true potential by combining the power of today’s technology with our passion for people. In 2020, we helped more than two million candidates find a meaningful job with our 236,100 clients. Randstad is active in 38 markets around the world and has top-three positions in almost half of these. In 2020, Randstad had on average 34,680 corporate employees and generated revenue of € 20.7 billion. Each day, at Randstad, we employ industry-scale recommender systems to recommend thousands of candidates to our clients, and the other way around; vacancies to job seekers. Our “Talent Recommender” recommender system is based on a heterogeneous collection of input data: CVs, vacancy texts (job descriptions) and structured data (e.g., the location of a candidate or vacancy). The goal of the system is to recommend the best candidates (talents) to each open vacancy. CVs are user-generated PDF files. It goes without saying that parsing those files to plain text can be a challenge in itself and therefore out of scope for this talk. On the other hand, vacancies are usually structured formatted text. We should be aware that due to the difference in structure and preprocessing steps, that the input to the subsequent steps is inevitably noisy. Most NLP research in text similarity is based on the assumption that 2 pieces of information are the same but written differently [1]. Like two artists that paint the same landscape, but each with its own style. However, in our case the 2 documents complement one another like pieces in a puzzle, together they create the bigger picture, rather than 2 similar paintings. Some of our biggest challenges with the “Talent Recommender” stem from dealing with the diverse nature of our textual sources of data: vacancies and CVs. While both capture similar information, they are inherently different in many ways. First, the information in CVs and vacancies are similar, but there exists a vocabulary gap, where grammar and context differ. For example, where “I have 10 years of experience as an instructor” in a CV shares no word overlap with “We are looking for a talented tutor” in a vacancy, both cases express similar information regarding “experience in the field of education,” we need to overcome the synonyms gap “instructor” and “tutor.” In addition, the sentence structure is completely different, CVs are typically written in “storytelling mode” “I have. . . ,” while the vacancy is in “exploration mode” “we are looking. . . ” The second challenge is multilinguality. Since we are a multinational company that operates all across the globe, developing a model per language is not scalable in our case. We ultimately would like one maintainable model that supports as many languages as possible. Our last challenge is cross language similarity [ 4]. In some of the countries we operate, there is a high percentage of job seekers that are not native to that country. For example, many of the job descriptions in the Netherlands are in Dutch, however around 10% of the CVs are in English. Classic text models, like TF-IDF and Word2vec, capture information within one language, but hardly connect between languages. Simply put, even if trained on multiple languages each language will have its own cluster in space. So “logistics” in English and “logistiek” in Dutch are embedded in a completely different point in space, even though the meaning is the same. Furthermore, we know that the language of CV correlates with nationality and therefore can be a proxy discriminator. Due to the impact of these systems and the risks of unintended algorithmic bias and discrimination, HR is marked as a high risk domain in the recently published EC Artificial Intelligence Act [2]. To avoid discriminating against nationality we would like to recommend a candidate to the vacancy no matter which language the CV is written in. That is of course only if language is not a requirement for that vacancy. In this talk, we will show how we used our internal history of candidate placements to generate labeled CV-vacancy pairs dataset. Afterwards we fine-tune a multilingual BERT with bi encoder structure [3] over this dataset, by adding a cosine similarity log loss layer. We will explain how using the mentioned structure helps us overcome most of the challenges described above, and how it enables us to build a maintainable and scalable pipeline to match CVs and vacancies. In addition, we show how we gain a better semantic understanding, and learn to bridge the vocabulary gap. Finally, we highlight how multilingual transformers help us handle cross language barrier and might reduce discrimination.</p>

    <h3>Elsevier, Fairness in Recommendations (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Kershaw</p>
    <p>At Elsevier we aim to help scientists further their research. On the one hand, by offering a platform for publishing ground-breaking research, and on the other by helping researchers discover relevant content to assist their work. In our team, Editorial Data Science, we support the former goal by providing tools to help editors in the decisions that they make, from finding reviewers to recommending transfers for manuscripts to more appropriate journals. To improve the workflows for publishing research and help editors in finding relevant reviewers we developed a reviewer recommender. The reviewer recommender will, based on a submitted manuscript, recommend reviewers that optimise the fit between the manuscript, the journal, and the reviewer themselves. To achieve this, the reviewer recommender is built on top of the three principles of quality data, expert knowledge, and experimentation. We leverage data from across Elsevier, ranging from Scopus profiles which includes publication histories and academic impact data, to data from our publishing platform which includes historic invites and subsequent actions around submitted manuscripts. All this data is used to develop and evaluate appropriate models for recommending reviewers. There are many factors to consider when deciding if someone is relevant to review a submitted manuscript. To name a few, the topic of interest of the reviewer, level of expertise of the reviewer, fit of the reviewer to the journal. But we are ultimately looking for the fit between the three stake holders: the manuscript, the journal, and the reviewer. However, it is not as simple as looking for a fit purely on topic or relevance. We can find evidence for that in the growth of research into recommender systems for multi-sided market [ 7] places where all sides within the systems must be considered. In our case, in addition to topical fit, we must consider fairness in recommendations, where minority groups get equal and fair treatment. For this reason, we consider two ’additional’ constraints when developing recommender systems at Elsevier, fairness in the recommendations and respecting the reviewers time and privacy. Fairness in Recommendations is important in recommending people particular within academic fields where there are known biases against minority groups. This bias is present in data which we use. [REF] showed that women and minorities over their academic and research careers are disadvantaged compared to members of the majority groups, either through less research output due to more teaching [ 6] or taking time out to raise families which resulted in lower number of research output [8]. Though bias is not only limited to quantities of research output [ 4 ] showed that women receive fewer citations even when controlling to quantity of research output and gender. This effect of receiving proportionally fewer citation is also amplified [ 5] identified that women are disproportionally ranked lower on the author list of a paper. These observations are not limited to gender but also race and age. Using these features derived from bibliometric analysis without due care within a model could lead to adverse impact against minority groups, resulting in the reviewers from these groups being recommended less and thus less invites to review manuscripts, whilst making sure any interventions does not create additional harms. Respecting user privacy and time. We know through user research that there is also the need to respect the researcher whom we are asking to review these manuscripts. Either because they are too busy to accept another review, or that they feel the manuscript is out of their scope and they are invited to review irrelevant papers. In this talk we show how at Elsevier we build fairness and understanding of stake holders into our recommenders, particularly the reviewer recommender. We experimented with a variety of technologies, ranging from simple search to sophisticated ML models. They all follow the common IR approach of candidate selection followed by re-ranking. All approaches use roughly the same features representing the reviewer (topics they have published in), the journal (topics the journal publishes and metrics about the reviewers they have selected before), the manuscript (key concepts within the manuscript). Through iterating over different models and techniques, we understand the importance of different features, along with their impact on model performance. But more specifically which features have inherent bias built into them, which feature are most predictive , and which fairness aware methods have been used to mitigate these biases [1, 2]. We will then discuss the methods and challenges of including bias metrics in the evaluation and development of the reviewer recommender. In this we focus on how we evaluate fairness from historical data along with group-wise fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equal opportunity. We then discuss the challenges and successes of monitoring these metrics in production [3]. This combination of feature understanding and fairness evaluation at every stage in the model development means we have a deep understanding of how the model works, who it impacts, and how. Resulting in a fair model which keeps the reviewers at the heart of the review process. However, we must not forget, this work sits within the wider academic review system, where bias is introduced on many levels through hiring, promotions and research engagement. Even though a reviewer recommender can not correct the underlying bias, it can contribute to a fairer and more equal outcome.</p>

    <h3>On the Robustness and Discriminative Power of IR Metrics for Top-N Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Bellogin, Daniel Valcarce, Pablo Castells, Javier Parapar</p>
    <p>The evaluation of Recommender Systems is still an open issue in the field. Despite its limitations, offline evaluation usually constitutes the first step in assessing recommendation methods due to its reduced costs and high reproducibility. Selecting the appropriate metric is a central issue in offline evaluation. Among the properties of recommendation systems, ranking accuracy attracts the most attention nowadays. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the advantages of different ranking metrics which were previously used in Information Retrieval and are now typically used for assessing top-N recommender systems. We propose methodologies for comparing the robustness and the discriminative power of different metrics. On the one hand, we study the influence of cut-offs and we find that deeper cut-offs offer greater robustness and discriminative power. On the other hand, we find that precision offers high robustness and Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain provides the best discriminative power.</p>

    <h3>Semantic-based Tag Recommendation in Scientific Bookmarking Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hebatallah A. Mohamed Hassan</p>
    <p>Recently, tagging has become a common way for users to organize and share digital content, and tag recommendation (TR) has become a very important research topic. Most of the recommendation approaches which are based on text embedding have utilized bag-of-words technique. On the other hand, proposed deep learning methods for capturing semantic meanings in the text, have been proved to be effective in various natural language processing (NLP) applications. In this paper, we present a content-based TR method that adopts deep recurrent neural networks to encode titles and abstracts of scientific articles into semantic vectors for enhancing the recommendation task, specifically bidirectional gated recurrent units (bi-GRUs) with attention mechanism. The experimental evaluation is performed on a dataset from CiteULike. The overall findings show that the proposed model is effective in representing scientific articles for tag recommendation.</p>

    <h3>A Novel Graph-based Model for Hybrid Recommendations in Cold-start Scenarios (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesare Bernardis, Paolo Cremonesi, Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema</p>
    <p>Cold-start is a very common and still open problem in the Recommender Systems literature. Since cold start items do not have any interaction, collaborative algorithms are not applicable. One of the main strategies is to use pure or hybrid content-based approaches, which usually yield to lower recommendation quality than collaborative ones. Some techniques to optimize performance of this type of approaches have been studied in recent past. One of them is called feature weighting, which assigns to every feature a real value, called weight, that estimates its importance. Statistical techniques for feature weighting commonly used in Information Retrieval, like TF-IDF, have been adapted for Recommender Systems, but they often do not provide sufficient quality improvements. More recent approaches, FBSM and LFW, estimate weights by leveraging collaborative information via machine learning, in order to learn the importance of a feature based on other users opinions. This type of models have shown promising results compared to classic statistical analyzes cited previously. We propose a novel graph, feature-based machine learning model to face the cold-start item scenario, learning the relevance of features from probabilities of item-based collaborative filtering algorithms.</p>

    <h3>MPR: Multi-Objective Pairwise Ranking (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rasaq Otunba, Jessica Lin, Raimi A. Rufai</p>
    <p>The recommendation challenge can be posed as the problem of predicting either item ratings or item rankings. The latter approach has proven more effective. Pairwise learning-to-rank techniques have been relatively successful. Hence, they are popularly used for learning recommender model parameters such as those in collaborative filtering (CF) models. The model parameters are learned by optimizing close smooth approximations of the non-smooth information retrieval (IR) metrics such as Mean Area Under ROC curve (AUC). Targeted campaigns are an alternative to item recommendations for increasing conversion. The user ranking task is referred to as audience retrieval. It is used in targeted campaigns to rank push campaign recipients based on their potential to convert. In this work, we consider the task of efficiently learning a ranking model that provides item recommendations and user rankings simultaneously.  We adopt pairwise learning for this task. We refer to our novel approach as multi-objective pairwise ranking (MPR). We describe our approach and evaluate its performance by experiments.</p>

    <h3>Intent-Aware Diversification Using a Constrained PLSA (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacek Wasilewski, Neil Hurley</p>
    <p>The intent-aware diversification framework was introduced initially in information retrieval and adopted to the context of recommender systems in the work of Vargas et al. The framework considers a set of aspects associated with items to be recommended. For instance, aspects may correspond to genres in movie recommendations. The framework depends on input aspect model consisting of item selection or relevance probabilities, given an aspect, and user intents, in the form of probabilities that the user is interested in each aspect. In this paper, we examine a number of input aspect models and evaluate the impact that different models have on the framework. In particular, we propose a constrained PLSA model that allows for interpretable output, in terms of known aspects, while achieving greater performance that the explicit co-occurrence counting method used in previous work. We evaluate the proposed models using a well-known MovieLens dataset for which item genres are available.</p>

    <h3>A Study of Priors for Relevance-Based Language Modelling of Recommender Systems (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Parapar, Daniel Valcarce, Álvaro Barreiro</p>
    <p>Probabilistic modelling of recommender systems naturally introduces the concept of prior probability into the recommendation task. Relevance-Based Language Models, a principled probabilistic query expansion technique in Information Retrieval, has been recently adapted to the item recommendation task with success. In this paper, we study the effect of the item and user prior probabilities under that framework. We adapt two priors from the document retrieval field and then we propose other two new probabilistic priors. Evidence gathered from experimentation indicates that a linear prior for the neighbour and a probabilistic prior based on Dirichlet smoothing for the items improve the quality of the item recommendation ranking.</p>

    <h3>Random Walk with Wait and Restart on Document Co-citation Network for Similar Document Search (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masaki Eto</p>
    <p>One of the latest algorithms for computing similarities between nodes in a graph is Random Walk with Restart (RWR). However, on a document co-citation network for similar document search, computing transition probabilities remains difficult. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a Random Walk with Wait and Restart (RWWR) algorithm, which contains a new technique for adjusting the transition probability by incorporating a “selfreturning” edge into the normalization. To evaluate its effectiveness empirically, the search performance of two retrieval methods using RWWR was compared to a method using the standard RWR; the performance was measured by average precision and nDCG. The experiment was conducted on a test collection created from the Open Access Subset of PubMed Central, and the results indicated that the RWWR methods tend to outperform the standard RWR method.</p>

    <h3>Task-Based User Modelling for Personalization via Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Mehrotra, Emine Yilmaz, Manisha Verma</p>
    <p>We introduce a novel approach to user modelling for behavioral targeting: task-based user representation and present an approach based on search task extraction from search logs wherein users are represented by their actions over a task-space. Given a web search log, we extract search tasks performed by users and nd user representations based on these tasks. More specically, we construct a user-task association matrix and borrow insights from Collaborative Filtering to learn low-dimensional factor model wherein the interests/preferences of a user are determined by a small number of latent factors. We compare the performance of the proposed approach on the task of collaborative query recommendation on publicly available AOL search log with a standard term-similarity baseline and discuss potential future research directions.</p>
