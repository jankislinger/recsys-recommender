    <h3>Collaborative filtering algorithms are prone to mainstream-taste bias (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Hager, Pantelis Analytis</p>
    <p>Collaborative filtering has been the main steam engine of the recommender systems community since the early 1990s. Collaborative filtering (and other) algorithms, however, have been predominantly evaluated by aggregating results across users or user groups. These performance averages hide large disparities: an algorithm may perform very well for some users (or groups) and very poorly for others. We show that performance variation is large and systematic. In experiments on three large scale datasets and using an array of collaborative filtering algorithms, we demonstrate the large performance disparities for different users across algorithms and datasets. We then show that performance variation is systematic and that two key features that characterize users, their mean taste similarity with other users and the dispersion in taste similarity, can explain performance variation better than previously identified features. We use these two features to visualize algorithm performance for different users, and point out that this mapping can be used to capture different categories of users that have been proposed before. Our results demonstrate an extensive mainstream-taste bias in all collaborative filtering algorithms, and they imply a fundamental fairness limitation that needs to be mitigated.</p>

    <h3>RepSys: Framework for Interactive Evaluation of Recommender Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel Kordík, Jan Šafařík, Vojtěch Vančura</p>
    <p>Making recommender systems more transparent and auditable is crucial for the future adoption of these systems. Available tools typically present mostly errors of models aggregated over all test users, which is often insufficient to uncover hidden biases and problems. Moreover, the emphasis is primarily on the accuracy of recommendations but less on other important metrics, such as the diversity of recommended items, the extent of catalog coverage, or the opportunity to discover novel items at bestsellers’ expense. In this work, we propose RepSys, a framework for evaluating recommender systems. Our work offers a set of highly interactive approaches for investigating various scenario recommendations, analyzing a dataset, and evaluating distributions of various metrics that combine visualization techniques with existing offline evaluation methods. RepSys framework is available under an open-source license to other researchers.</p>

    <h3>HCI for Recommender Systems: the Past, the Present and the Future (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Ziefle, André Calero Valdez, Katrien Verbert</p>
    <p>How can you discover something new, that matches your interest? Recommender Systems have been studied since the 90ies. Their benefit comes from guiding a user through the density of the information jungle to useful knowledge clearings. Early research on recommender systems focuses on algorithms and their evaluation to improve recommendation accuracy using F-measures and other methodologies from signal-detection theory. Present research includes other aspects such as human factors that affect the user experience and interactive visualization techniques to support transparency of results and user control. In this paper, we analyze all publications on recommender systems from the scopus database, and particularly also papers with such an HCI focus. Based on an analysis of these papers, future topics for recommender systems research are identified, which include more advanced support for user control, adaptive interfaces, affective computing and applications in high risk domains.</p>
