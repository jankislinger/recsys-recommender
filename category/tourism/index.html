    <h3>Improving Group Recommendations using Personality, Dynamic Clustering and Multi-Agent MicroServices (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> André Martins, Goreti Marreiros, Patrícia Alves, Paulo Novais</p>
    <p>The complexity associated to group recommendations needs strategies to mitigate several problems, such as the group’s heterogeinity and conflicting preferences, the emotional contagion phenomenon, the cold-start problem, and the group members’ needs and concerns while providing recommendations that satisfy all members at once. In this demonstration, we show how we implemented a Multi-Agent Microservice to represent the tourists in a mobile Group Recommender System for Tourism prototype. A novel dynamic clustering process is presented to help minimize the group’s heterogeneity and conflicting preferences. To help solve the cold-start problem, the preliminary tourist attractions preference and travel-related preferences & concerns are predicted using the tourists’ personality, while taking the tourists’ disabilities and fears into account. Although there is no need for previous interactions data to build the tourists’ profile since we predict the tourists’ preferences, the tourist agents learn with each other by using association rules to find patterns in the tourists’ profile and in the ratings given to Points of Interest to refine the recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Modeling Users and Items for Recommenders: There Is More than Semantics (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mete Sertkan</p>
    <p>Recommender systems aim to help us to take better decisions and thus to save resources and increase satisfaction. Personalized recommendations are their main asset. In some domains, such as tourism or news, recommender systems rely more on content-based approaches to give personalized recommendations, due to domain-specific challenges. Content-based methods tend to recommend items semantically similar to the users’ previous consumptions. However, the content of items (e.g., text, visuals, categories, etc.) usually contains more than semantic properties.<br>In this PhD work we focus on the multifaceted nature of the recommendation items. Besides the mentioned semantic properties, we also take into account visual and textual style elements and more complex concepts such as emotions and personality. Our aim is to address people also on a non-rational, non-verbal, and rather emotional level; and thus, to improve recommendations. We propose a statistical-learning-based characterization of items, a picture-based approach to profile users and items, and a neural end-to-end approach, where we learn to represent users and items, and simultaneously to recommend. In all of the proposed methods we consider in addition to the semantic content either stylistic elements and/or more complex concepts like personality, and observe their impact. To contribute the community, we plan to open source our code and the datasets (to the extent our collaborators agree).</p>

    <h3>PicTouRe – A Picture-Based Tourism Recommender (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hannes Werthner, Mete Sertkan, Julia Neidhardt</p>
    <p>We present PicTouRe – a picture-based tourism recommender. PicTouRe aims to mitigate people’s difficulties in explicitly expressing their touristic preferences, which is even more challenging in the initial phase of travel decision making. Addressing this issue, with PicTouRe we follow the idiom “a picture is worth a thousand words” and use pictures as a tool to implicitly elicit peoples’ touristic preferences. We describe the core concept of PicTouRe - the Generic Profiler, which in essence determines an explainable vector representation, i.e., touristic profile, given any picture collection as input. We showcase a user’s journey through PicTouRe and describe the steps behind. Finally, we present results of a first user study supporting our approach. PicTouRe is available under https://pictoprof.ec.tuwien.ac.at and a demo video under https://youtu.be/xZnXLPcenEs.</p>

    <h3>User-Centered Evaluation of Strategies for Recommending Sequences of Points of Interest to Groups (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wolfgang Wörndl, Daniel Herzog</p>
    <p>Most recommender systems (RSs) predict the preferences of individual users; however, in certain scenarios, recommendations need to be made for a group of users. Tourism is a popular domain for group recommendations because people often travel in groups and look for point of interest (POI) sequences for their visits during a trip. In this study, we present different strategies that can be used to recommend POI sequences for groups. In addition, we introduce novel approaches, including a strategy called Split Group, which allows groups to split into smaller groups during a trip. We compared all strategies in a user study with 40 real groups. Our results proved that there was a significant difference in the quality of recommendations generated by using the different strategies. Most groups were willing to split temporarily during a trip, even when they were traveling with persons close to them. In this case, Split Group generated the best recommendations for different evaluation criteria. We use these findings to propose improvements for group recommendation strategies in the tourism domain.</p>

    <h3>Harnessing A Generalised User Behaviour Model for Next-POI Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Massimo, Francesco Ricci</p>
    <p>Recommender Systems (RSs) are commonly used in web applications to support users in finding items of their interest. In this paper we propose a novel RS approach to support human decision making by leveraging data acquired in the physical world. We focus on the tourism domain and we consider a scenario in which users’ choices, i.e., visit to points of interests (POIs), are tracked and used to generate recommendations for not yet visited POIs. We propose a novel approach to behaviour modelling that is based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). On top of this we propose two, non trivial, strategies for generating interesting recommendations, i.e., that differ from the straight next action prediction usually performed by state of the art models. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach outperforms state of the art models in terms of overall utility the user gains by following the provided recommendations and novelty of the newly recommended items.</p>

    <h3>User Preference Learning in Multi-criteria Recommendations using Stacked Auto Encoders (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bidyut Kr. Patra, Korra Sathya Babu, Dharahas Tallapally, Rama Syamala Sreepada</p>
    <p>Recommender System (RS) has been an essential component of many businesses, especially in e-commerce domain. RS exploits and processes the preference history (rating, purchase, review, etc.) of users in order to provide the recommendations. A user in traditional RS can provide only one rating value about an item. Deep Neural Networks have been used in this single rating system to improve recommendation accuracy in the recent times. However, the single rating systems are inadequate to understand the users’ preferences about an item. On the other hand, business enterprises such as tourism, e-learning, etc. facilitate users to provide multiple criteria ratings about an item, thus it becomes easier to understand users’ preference over single rating system. In this paper, we propose an extended Stacked Autoencoders (a Deep Neural Network technique) to utilize the multi-criteria ratings. The proposed network is designed to learn the relationship between each user’s criteria ratings and overall rating efficiently. Experimental results on real world datasets (Yahoo! Movies and TripAdvisor) demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art single rating systems and multi-criteria approaches on various performance metrics.</p>

    <h3>Eliciting the Users’ Unknown Preferences (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Neidhardt, Hannes Werthner, Leonhard Seyfang, Rainer Schuster</p>
    <p>Personalized recommendation strongly relies on an accurate model to capture user preferences; eliciting this information is, in general, a hard problem. In the field of tourism this initial profiling becomes even more challenging. It has been shown that particularly in the beginning of the travel decision making process, users themselves are often not conscious of their needs and are not able to express them. In this paper, the basics of a picture-based approach are introduced that aims at revealing implicitly given user preferences. Based on a set of travel related pictures selected by a user, an individual travel profile is deduced. This is accomplished by mapping those pictures onto seven basic factors that reflect different travel behavioral aspects. Also tourism products can be represented by this simple seven factor model. Thus, this model constitutes the basis of our recommendation algorithm. In addition, users experience this non-verbal way of interaction as exiting and inspiring.</p>
