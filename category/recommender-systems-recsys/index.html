    <h3>Sliding Window Training – Utilizing Historical Recommender Systems Data for Foundation Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ko-Jen Hsiao, Yesu Feng, Sudarshan Lamkhede, Swanand Joshi, Zhe Zhang</p>
    <p>Long-lived recommender systems (RecSys) often encounter lengthy user-item interaction histories that span many years. To effectively learn long term user preferences, Large RecSys foundation models (FM) need to encode this information in pretraining. Usually, this is done by either generating a long enough sequence length to take all history sequences as input at the cost of large model input dimension or by dropping some parts of the user history to accommodate model size and latency requirements on the production serving side. In this paper, we introduce a sliding window training technique to incorporate long user history sequences during training time without increasing the model input dimension. We show the quantitative \& qualitative improvements this technique brings to the RecSys FM in learning user long term preferences. We additionally show that the average quality of items in the catalog learnt in pretraining also improves.</p>

    <h3>Evaluating the Pros and Cons of Recommender Systems Explanations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kathrin Wardatzky</p>
    <p>Despite the growing interest in explainable AI in the RecSys community, the evaluation of explanations is still an open research topic. Typically, explanations are evaluated using offline metrics, with a case study, or through a user study. In my research, I will have a closer look at the evaluation of the effects of explanations on users. I investigate two possible factors that can impact the effects reported in recent publications, namely the explanation design and content as well as the users themselves. I further address the problem of determining promising explanations for an application scenario from a seemingly endless pool of options. Lastly, I propose a user study to close some of the research gaps established in the surveys and investigate how recommender systems explanations impact the understanding of users with different backgrounds.</p>

    <h3>Sequential Recommendation Models: A Graph-based Perspective (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Peintner</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RecSys) traditionally leverage the users’ rich interaction data with the system, but ignore the sequential dependency of items. Sequential recommender systems aim to predict the next item the user will interact with (e.g., click on, purchase, or listen to) based on the preceding interactions of the user. Current state-of-the-art approaches focus on transformer-based architectures and graph neural networks. Specifically, the modeling of sequences as graphs has shown to be a promising approach to introduce a structured bias into the recommendation learning framework. In this work, we will outline our research of exploring different applications of graphs in sequential recommendation.</p>
