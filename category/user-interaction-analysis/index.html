    <h3>Extended conversion: Capturing successful interactions in voice shopping (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elad Haramaty, Arnon Lazerson, Zohar Karnin, Yoelle Maarek, Liane Lewin-Eytan</p>
    <p>Being able to measure the success of online shopping interactions is crucial in order to evaluate and optimize the performance of e-commerce systems. We consider the domain of voice shopping, supported by digital voice-based assistants, where measuring successful interactions poses a challenge. Unlike Web shopping, which offers a rich amount of behavioral signals such as clicks, in voice shopping a non-negligible amount of shopping interactions frequently end without any immediate explicit or implicit user behavioral signal. Moreover, users may start their journey using voice, but finish elsewhere, for example by using their mobile app or Web. We explore the challenge of measuring successful interactions in voice product search based on users’ feedback, and propose a medium-term reward metric named Extended ConVersion (ECVR). ECVR extends the notion of conversion (purchase action), which is a clear and natural indication of success for an e-commerce system. The strength of this new metric, is that it does not only capture immediate conversion, but also a conversion that is part of the same user shopping journey, but is performed at a later stage, possibly using a different medium. We provide multiple ways of evaluating the quality of a metric, and use these to explore different parameters leading to different variants of ECVR. After finalizing these parameters, we show that a ranking system optimized for the proposed ECVR leads to an improvement in long-term engagement and revenue, without compromising immediate gains.</p>

    <h3>Deep Situation-Aware Interaction Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongkang Wang, Dong Wang, Yisong Yu, Beihong Jin, Yapeng Zhang, Jian Dong, Xingxing Wang, Shuli Wang, Yimin Lv</p>
    <p>User behavior sequence modeling plays a significant role in Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction on e-commerce platforms. Except for the interacted items, user behaviors contain rich interaction information, such as the behavior type, time, location, etc. However, so far, the information related to user behaviors has not yet been fully exploited. In the paper, we propose the concept of a situation and situational features for distinguishing interaction behaviors and then design a CTR model named Deep Situation-Aware Interaction Network (DSAIN). DSAIN first adopts the reparameterization trick to reduce noise in the original user behavior sequences. Then it learns the embeddings of situational features by feature embedding parameterization and tri-directional correlation fusion. Finally, it obtains the embedding of behavior sequence via heterogeneous situation aggregation. We conduct extensive offline experiments on three real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DSAIN model. More importantly, DSAIN has increased the CTR by 2.70\%, the CPM by 2.62\%, and the GMV by 2.16\% in the online A/B test. Now, DSAIN has been deployed on the Meituan food delivery platform and serves the main traffic of the Meituan takeout app. Our source code is available at https://github.com/W-void/DSAIN</p>

    <h3>Explicit Elimination of Similarity Blocking for Session-based Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martha Larson, Mattia Brusamento, Paolo Cremonesi, Roberto Pagano</p>
    <p>A single `odd’ interaction can cause two user interaction sessions to diverge in similarity, and stand in the way of generalization. The sensitivity of session-based recommenders to session similarity motivates us to explicitly identify and remove such `similarity blockers’. Specifically, we leverage huge amounts of data, which allow us to identify blockers in the form of non-co-occurring items. Other blockers can be identified using content-based similarity. Our experiments reveal that explicitly eliminating relatively few blockers improves performance.</p>

    <h3>Improving The Discriminative Power Of Inferred Content Information Using Segmented Virtual Profile (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Trevor Walker, Anmol Bhasin, Anuj Goyal, Haishan Liu</p>
    <p>We present a novel component of a hybrid recommender system at LinkedIn, where item features are augmented by a virtual profile based on observed user-item interactions. The concept of virtual profiles is generating a representation of an item in the user feature space by leveraging the over-represented user features from users that interacted with the item. It is a way to think about Collaborative Filtering with content features. The core principle is that if the feature occurs with high probability for the users who interacted with an item (henceforth termed as relevant users) versus those who did not (henceforth termed non-relevant users), then that feature is a good candidate to be included in the virtual profile of the item in question. However this scheme suffers from the data imbalance problem, given that observed relevant users are usually an extremely small minority group compared to the whole user base. Feature selection in this skewed setting is prone to noise from the overwhelming non-relevant examples that belong to the majority class. To alleviate the problem, we propose a method to select the most relevant non-relevant examples from the majority class by segmenting users on certain intelligently selected feature dimensions. The resulting virtual profile from the method is called the segmented virtual profile. Empirical evaluation on real-world large scale recommender system at LinkedIn shows that simple strategies for the segmentation yield significantly better performance.</p>
