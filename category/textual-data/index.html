    <h3>Large Language Model Augmented Narrative Driven Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamed Zamani, Sheshera Mysore, Andrew Mccallum</p>
    <p>Narrative-driven recommendation (NDR) presents an information access problem where users solicit recommendations with verbose descriptions of their preferences and context, for example, travelers soliciting recommendations for points of interest while describing their likes/dislikes and travel circumstances. These requests are increasingly important with the rise of natural language-based conversational interfaces for search and recommendation systems. However, NDR lacks abundant training data for models, and current platforms commonly do not support these requests. Fortunately, classical user-item interaction datasets contain rich textual data, e.g., reviews, which often describe user preferences and context — this may be used to bootstrap training for NDR models. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation to train NDR models. We use LLMs for authoring synthetic narrative queries from user-item interactions with few-shot prompting and train retrieval models for NDR on synthetic queries and user-item interaction data. Our experiments demonstrate that this is an effective strategy for training small-parameter retrieval models that outperform other retrieval and LLM baselines for narrative-driven recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Complementary Product Recommendation for Long-tail Products (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rastislav Papso</p>
    <p>Identifying complementary relations between products plays a key role in e-commerce Recommender Systems (RS). Existing methods in Complementary Product Recommendation (CPR), however, focus only on identifying complementary relations in huge and data-rich catalogs, while none of them considers real-world scenarios of small and medium e-commerce platforms with limited number of interactions. In this paper, we discuss our research proposal that addresses the problem of identifying complementary relations in such sparse settings. To overcome the data sparsity problem, we propose to first learn complementary relations in large and data-rich catalogs and then transfer learned knowledge to small and scarce ones. To be able to map individual products across different catalogs and thus transfer learned relations between them, we propose to create Product Universal Embedding Space (PUES) using textual and visual product meta-data, which serves as a common ground for the products from arbitrary catalog.</p>

    <h3>Combining Rating and Review Data by Initializing Latent Factor Models with Topic Models for Top-N Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barry Smyth, Aonghus Lawlor, Francisco J. Peña, Diarmuid O’Reilly-Morgan, Elias Z. Tragos, Erika Duriakova, Neil Hurley</p>
    <p>Nowadays we commonly have multiple sources of data associated with items. Users may provide numerical ratings, or implicit interactions, but may also provide textual reviews. Although many algorithms have been proposed to jointly learn a model over both interactions and textual data, there is room to improve the many factorization models that are proven to work well on interactions data, but are not designed to exploit textual information. Our focus in this work is to propose a simple, yet easily applicable and effective, method to incorporate review data into such factorization models. In particular, we propose to build the user and item embeddings within the topic space of a topic model learned from the review data. This has several advantages: we observe that initializing the user and item embeddings in topic space leads to faster convergence of the factorization algorithm to a model that out-performs models initialized randomly, or with other state-of-the-art initialization strategies. Moreover, constraining user and item factors to topic space allows for the learning of an interpretable model that users can visualise.</p>

    <h3>Relaxed Softmax for PU Learning (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ugo Tanielian, Flavian Vasile</p>
    <p>In recent years, the softmax model and its fast approximations have become the de-facto loss functions for deep neural networks when dealing with multi-class prediction. This loss has been extended to language modeling and recommendation, two fields that fall into the framework of learning from Positive and Unlabeled data. In this paper, we stress the different drawbacks of the current family of softmax losses and sampling schemes when applied in a Positive and Unlabeled learning setup. We propose both a Relaxed Softmax loss (RS) and a new negative sampling scheme based on a Boltzmann formulation. We show that the new training objective is better suited for the tasks of density estimation, item similarity and next-event prediction by driving uplifts in performance on textual and recommendation datasets against classical softmax.</p>

    <h3>Analysis of User-generated Content for Improving YouTube Video Recommendation (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabio Gasparetti, Davide Feltoni Gurini, Alessandro Micarelli, Giuseppe Sansonetti, Michele Galli</p>
    <p>Everyday video-sharing websites such as YouTube collect large amounts of new multimedia resources. Comments left by viewers often provide valuable information to describe sentiments, opinions and tastes of users. For this reason, we propose a novel re-ranking approach that takes into consideration that information in order to provide better recommendations of related videos. Early experiments indicate an improvement in the recommendation performance.</p>
