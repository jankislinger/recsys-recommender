    <h3>Additive Co-Clustering with Social Influence for Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liping Jing, Huafeng Liu, Xixi Du</p>
    <p>Recommender system is a popular tool to accurately and actively provide users with potentially interesting information. For capturing the users’ preferences and approximating the missing data, matrix completion and approximation are widely adopted. Except for the typical low-rank factorization-based methods, the additive co-clustering approach (ACCAMS) is recently proposed to succinctly approximate large-scale rating matrix. Although ACCAMS efficiently produces effective recommendation result, it still suffers from the cold-start problem. To address this issue, we propose a Social Influence Additive Co-Clustering method (SIACC) by making use of user-item rating data and user-user social relations. The main idea of SIACC is to extract the social influences from the social network, integrate them to additive co-clustering for effectively determining the user clusters and item clusters, minimize the loss error by backfitting the residuals of data approximation in the previous iteration, and finally improve the recommendation performance. In order to take advantage of social influence, we present a graph-regularized weighted-Fuzzy C-Means algorithm (gwFCM) to cluster users. gwFCM has ability to identify user groups from both rating and social information. Specifically, gwFCM makes sure that a pair of users have similar cluster membership if they have direct social relation (denoted as local social influence), and that the user with higher reputation (denoted as global social influence) plays a dominate role in clustering process. The reasonable user clusters obtained by gwFCM can benefit the item clustering, which will leverage the additive co-clustering processing and further improve the recommendation performance. A series of experiments on three real-world datasets have shown that SIACC outperforms the existing popular recommendation methods (PMF and ACCAMS) and social recommendation methods (SoReg, TrustMF, Locabal and SPF), especially on the cold-start users recommendation and running time.</p>

    <h3>Are You Influenced by Others When Rating? Improve Rating Prediction by Conformity Modeling (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yong Yu, Xuezhi Cao, Yiming Liu</p>
    <p>Conformity has a strong influence to user behaviors, even in online environment. When surfing online, users are usually flooded with others’ opinions. These opinions implicitly contribute to the user’s ongoing behaviors. However, there is no research work modeling online conformity yet. In this paper, we model user’s conformity in online rating sites. We conduct analysis using real data to show the existence and strength of conformity in these scenarios. We propose a matrix-factorization-based conformity modeling technique to improve the accuracy of rating prediction. Experiments show that our model outperforms existing works significantly (with a relative improvement of 11.72% on RMSE). Therefore, we draw the conclusion that conformity modeling is important for understanding user behaviors and can contribute to further improve the online recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Discovering What You’re Known For: A Contextual Poisson Factorization Approach (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haokai Lu, James Caverlee, Wei Niu</p>
    <p>Discovering what people are known for is valuable to many important applications such as recommender systems. Unlike an individual’s personal interests, what a user is known for is reflected by the views of others, and is often not easily discerned for a long-tail of the vast majority of users. In this paper, we tackle the problem of discovering what users are known for through a probabilistic model called Bayesian Contextual Poisson Factorization. Moving beyond just modeling user’s content, it naturally models and integrates additional contextual factors, concretely, user’s geo-spatial footprints and social influence, to overcome noisy online activities and social relations. Through GPS-tagged social media datasets, we find that the proposed method can improve known-for prediction performance by 17.5% in precision and 20.9% in recall on average, and that it can capture the implicit relationships between a user’s known-for profile and her content, geo-spatial and social influence.</p>

    <h3>Preference-oriented Social Networks: Group Recommendation and Inference (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Craig Boutilier, Amirali Salehi-Abari</p>
    <p>Social networks facilitate a variety of social, economic, and political interactions. Homophily and social influence suggest that preferences (e.g., over products, services, political parties) are likely to be correlated among people whom directly interact in a social network. We develop a model, , that captures such correlations of individual preferences, where preferences take the form of rankings over a set of options. We develop probabilistic inference methods for predicting individual preferences given observed social connections and partial observations of the preferences of others in the network. We exploit these predictions in a context to make group decisions or recommendations even when the preferences of some group members are unobserved. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms and the improvements made possible by accounting for social ties.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Temporal Influence in Online Recommendation (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Palovics, Tamas Kiss, Andras Benczur, Erzsebet Frigo, Levente Kocsis</p>
    <p>In this paper we give methods for time aware music recommendation in a social media service with the potential of exploiting immediate temporal influences between users. We consider events when a user listens to an artist the first time and this event follows some friend listening to the same artist short time before. We train a blend of matrix factorization methods that model the relation of the influencer, the influenced and the artist, both the individual factor decompositions and their weight learned by variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Special care is taken since events of influence form a subset of the positive implicit feedback data and hence we have to cope with two different definitions of the positive and negative implicit training data. In addition, in the time aware setting we have to use online learning and evaluation methods. While SGD can easily be trained online, evaluation is cumbersome by traditional measures since we will have potentially different top recommendations at different times. Our experiments are carried over the two-year scrobble history of 70,000 Last.fm users and show a 4% increase in recommendation quality by predicting temporal influences.</p>
