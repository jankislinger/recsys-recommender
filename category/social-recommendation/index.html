    <h3>CR-SoRec: BERT driven Consistency Regularization for Social Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raksha Jalan, Naoyuki Onoe, Tushar Prakash, Brijraj Singh</p>
    <p>In the real world, when we seek our friends’ opinions on various items or events, we request verbal social recommendations. It has been observed that we often turn to our friends for recommendations on a daily basis. The emergence of online social platforms has enabled users to share their opinion with their social connections. Therefore, we should consider users’ social connections to enhance online recommendation performance. The social recommendation aims to fuse social links with user-item interactions to offer more relevant recommendations. Several efforts have been made to develop an effective social recommendation system. However, there are two significant limitations to current methods: First, they haven’t thoroughly explored the intricate relationships between the diverse influences of neighbours on users’ preferences. Second, existing models are vulnerable to overfitting due to the relatively low number of user-item interaction records in the interaction space. For the aforementioned problems,  this paper offers a novel framework called CR-SoRec, an effective recommendation model based on BERT and Consistency Regularization. This model incorporates Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer(BERT) to learn bidirectional context-aware user and item embeddings with neighbourhood sampling. The neighbourhood Sampling technique samples the most influential neighbours for all the users/ items. Further, to effectively use the available user-item interaction data and social ties, we leverage diverse perspectives via consistency regularisation to harness the underlying information. The main objective of our model is to predict the next item that a user would interact with based on its interaction behaviour and social connections. Experimental results show that our model defines a new state-of-the-art on various datasets and outperforms previous work by a significant margin. Extensive experiments are conducted to analyse the method. We release the source code of our model at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CR-SoRec-68F4</p>

    <h3>PsRec: Social Recommendation with Pseudo Ratings (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiajin Li, Shengyu Zhang, Yitong Meng, Guangyong Chen</p>
    <p>Data sparsity and cold start are two major problems that collaborative filtering based recommender systems confront. In many modern Internet applications, we have a social network over the users of recommender systems, from which social information can be utilized to improve the accuracy of recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel trust-based matrix factorization model. Unlike most existing social recommender systems which use social information in form of a regularizer on parameters of recommendation algorithms, we utilize the social information to densify the training data set by filling certain missing values (handle the data sparsity problem). In addition, by employing different pseudo rating generating criteria on cold start users and normal users, we can also partially solve the cold start problem effectively. Experiment results on real-world data sets demonstrated the superiority of our method over state-of-art approaches.</p>

    <h3>STAR: Semiring Trust Inference for Trust-Aware Social Recommenders (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jennifer Golbeck, Peixin Gao, John S Baras, Hui Miao</p>
    <p>Social recommendation takes advantage of the influence of social relationships in decision making and the ready availability of social data through social networking systems. Trust relationships in particular can be exploited in such systems for rating prediction and recommendation, which has been shown to have the potential for improving the quality of the recommender and alleviating the issue of data sparsity, cold start, and adversarial attacks. An appropriate trust inference mechanism is necessary in extending the knowledge base of trust opinions and tackling the issue of limited trust information due to connection sparsity of social networks. In this work, we offer a new solution to trust inference in social networks to provide a better knowledge base for trust-aware recommender systems. We propose using a semiring framework as a nonlinear way to combine trust evidences for inferring trust, where trust relationship is model as 2-D vector containing both trust and certainty information. The trust propagation and aggregation rules, as the building blocks of our trust inference scheme, are based upon the properties of trust relationships. In our approach, both trust and distrust (i.e., positive and negative trust) are considered, and opinion conflict resolution is supported. We evaluate the proposed approach on real-world datasets, and show that our trust inference framework has high accuracy, and is capable of handling trust relationship in large networks. The inferred trust relationships can enlarge the knowledge base for trust information and improve the quality of trust-aware recommendation.</p>
