    <h3>Enhancing Sequential Music Recommendation with Negative Feedback-informed Contrastive Learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahrzad Shashaani, Pavan Seshadri, Peter Knees</p>
    <p>Modern music streaming services are heavily based on recommen- dation engines to serve continuous content to users. Sequential recommendation—continuously providing new items within a sin- gle session in a contextually coherent manner—has been an emerg- ing topic in current literature. User feedback—a positive or negative response to the item presented—is used to drive content recom- mendations by learning user preferences. We extend this idea to the session-based recommendation domain to improve learning of context-coherent music recommendations by modelling negative user feedback, i.e., skips, in the loss function. To this end, we propose a sequence-aware contrastive sub-task to structure item embeddings in session-based music recommen- dation, such that true next-positive items (ignoring skipped items) are structured closer in the embedding space, while skipped tracks are structured farther away from all items in the session. Since this causes skipped item embeddings in a session to be farther than unskipped items in the learned space, this directly affects item rankings using a K-nearest-neighbors search for next-item recom- mendations, while also promoting the rank of the true next item. Experiments incorporating this task into SoTA methods for sequen- tial item recommendation show consistent performance gains in terms of next-item hit rate, item ranking, and skip down-ranking on three music recommendation datasets, strongly benefiting from increasing presence of user feedback.</p>

    <h3>Transformers Meet ACT-R: Repeat-Aware and Sequential Listening Session Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Sguerra, Viet-Anh Tran, Romain Hennequin, Guillaume Salha-Galvan</p>
    <p>Music streaming services often leverage sequential recommender systems to predict the best music to showcase to users based on past sequences of listening sessions. Nonetheless, most sequential recommendation methods ignore or insufficiently account for repetitive behaviors. This is a crucial limitation for music recommendation, as repeatedly listening to the same song over time is a common phenomenon, that can even change the way users perceive this song. In this paper, we introduce PISA (Psychology-Informed Session embedding using ACT-R), a session-level sequential recommender system that overcomes this limitation. PISA employs a Transformer architecture learning embedding representations of listening sessions and users using attention mechanisms inspired by Anderson’s ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Though-Rational), a cognitive architecture modeling human information access and memory dynamics. This approach enables us to capture dynamic and repetitive patterns from user behaviors, allowing us to effectively predict the songs they will listen to in subsequent sessions, whether they are repeated or new ones. We demonstrate the empirical relevance of PISA using public listening data from Last.fm and proprietary data from a global music streaming service, thereby confirming the critical importance of repetition modeling for sequential listening session recommendation. Along with this paper, we publicly release our proprietary dataset to foster future research in this field, as well as the source code of PISA to facilitate its future use.</p>

    <h3>Of Spiky SVDs and Music Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darius Afchar, Romain Hennequin, Vincent Guigue</p>
    <p>The truncated singular value decomposition is a widely used methodology in music recommendation for direct similar-item retrieval or embedding musical items for downstream tasks. This paper investigates a curious effect that we show naturally occurring on many recommendation datasets: spiking formations in the embedding space. We first propose a metric to quantify this spiking organization’s strength, then mathematically prove its origin tied to underlying communities of items of varying internal popularity. With this new-found theoretical understanding, we finally open the topic with an industrial use case of estimating how music embeddings’ top-k similar items will change over time under the addition of data.</p>

    <h3>Flow Moods: Recommending Music by Moods on Deezer (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marin Lorant, Benjamin Chapus, Mathieu Morlon, Guillaume Salha-Galvan, Théo Bontempelli, François Rigaud</p>
    <p>The music streaming service Deezer extensively relies on its Flow algorithm, which generates personalized radio-style playlists of songs, to help users discover musical content. Nonetheless, despite promising results over the past years, Flow used to ignore the moods of users when providing recommendations. In this paper, we present Flow Moods, an improved version of Flow that addresses this limitation. Flow Moods leverages collaborative filtering, audio content analysis, and mood annotations from professional music curators to generate personalized mood-specific playlists at scale. We detail the motivations, the development, and the deployment of this system on Deezer. Since its release in 2021, Flow Moods has been recommending music by moods to millions of users every day.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Negative Preference in Content-based Music Recommendation with Contrastive Learning (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minju Park, Kyogu Lee</p>
    <p>Advanced music recommendation systems are being introduced along with the development of machine learning. However, it is essential to design a music recommendation system that can increase user satisfaction by understanding users’ music tastes, not by the complexity of models. Although several studies related to music recommendation systems exploiting negative preferences have shown performance improvements, there was a lack of explanation on how they led to better recommendations. In this work, we analyze the role of negative preference in users’ music tastes by comparing music recommendation models with contrastive learning exploiting preference (CLEP) but with three different training strategies - exploiting preferences of both positive and negative (CLEP-PN), positive only (CLEP-P), and negative only (CLEP-N). We evaluate the effectiveness of the negative preference by validating each system with a small amount of personalized data obtained via survey and further illuminate the possibility of exploiting negative preference in music recommendations. Our experimental results show that CLEP-N outperforms the other two in accuracy and false positive rate. Furthermore, the proposed training strategies produced a consistent tendency regardless of different types of front-end musical feature extractors, proving the stability of the proposed method.</p>

    <h3>Siamese Neural Networks for Content-based Cold-Start Music Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Pulis, Josef Bajada</p>
    <p>Music recommendation systems typically use collaborative filtering to determine which songs to recommend to their users. This mechanism matches a user with listeners that have similar tastes, and uses their listening history to find songs that the user will probably like. The fundamental issue with this approach is that artists already need to have a significant user following to get a fair chance of being recommended. This is known as the music cold-start problem. In this work, we investigate the possibility of making music recommendations based on audio content so that new artists still get a good chance of being recommended, even if they do not have a sufficient number of listeners yet. We propose the use of Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) to determine the similarity between two audio clips. Each clip is first pre-processed into a Mel-Spectrogram, which is then used as input to an SNN consisting of two identical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The output of each CNN is then compared together to determine whether two songs are similar or not. These were trained using audio from the Free Music Archive, with the genre used as a heuristic to determine the similarity between song pairs. A query-by-multiple-example (QBME) music recommendation system was developed that makes use of the proposed content-based similarity metric to find songs that match the user’s tastes. This was packaged inside an online blind-test survey, which first prompts participants to select a set of preferred songs, and then recommends a number of songs which the subject is expected to listen to and rate on a Likert scale. The recommendations from the proposed algorithm were stochastically interleaved with songs selected randomly from the preferred genres of the user, as a baseline for comparison. The participants were not aware that the recommendations came from two different algorithms. Our findings show that 60.7% of the 150 participants gave higher ratings to the recommendations made by the proposed SNN-based algorithm. Findings also show that 55% of the recommended songs had less than 1,500 listens, demonstrating that the proposed content-based approach can provide a fairer exposure to all artists based on their music, independent of their fame and popularity.</p>

    <h3>Top-K Contextual Bandits with Equity of Exposure (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Jeunen, Bart Goethals</p>
    <p>The contextual bandit paradigm provides a general framework for decision-making under uncertainty. It is theoretically well-defined and well-studied, and many personalisation use-cases can be cast as a bandit learning problem. Because this allows for the direct optimisation of utility metrics that rely on online interventions (such as click-through-rate (CTR)), this framework has become an attractive choice to practitioners. Historically, the literature on this topic has focused on a one-sided, user-focused notion of utility, overall disregarding the perspective of content providers in online marketplaces (for example, musical artists on streaming services). If not properly taken into account – recommendation systems in such environments are known to lead to unfair distributions of attention and exposure, which can directly affect the income of the providers. Recent work has shed a light on this, and there is now a growing consensus that some notion of “equity of exposure” might be preferable to implement in many recommendation use-cases.<br>We study how the top-K contextual bandit problem relates to issues of disparate exposure, and how this disparity can be minimised. The predominant approach in practice is to greedily rank the top-K items according to their estimated utility, as this is optimal according to the well-known Probability Ranking Principle. Instead, we introduce a configurable tolerance parameter that defines an acceptable decrease in utility for a maximal increase in fairness of exposure. We propose a personalised exposure-aware arm selection algorithm that handles this relevance-fairness trade-off on a user-level, as recent work suggests that users’ openness to randomisation may vary greatly over the global populace. Our model-agnostic algorithm deals with arm selection instead of utility modelling, and can therefore be implemented on top of any existing bandit system with minimal changes. We conclude with a case study on carousel personalisation in music recommendation: empirical observations highlight the effectiveness of our proposed method and show that exposure disparity can be significantly reduced with a negligible impact on user utility.</p>

    <h3>Inferring the Causal Impact of New Track Releases on Music Recommendation Platforms through Counterfactual Predictions (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mounia Lalmas, Rishabh Mehrotra, Prasanta Bhattacharya</p>
    <p>With over 20,000 tracks being released each day, recommendation systems that power music streaming services should not only be responsive to such large volumes of content, but also be adept at understanding the impact of such new releases on, both, users’ listening behavior and popularity of artists. Inferring the causal impact of new track releases is critical to fully characterizing the interplay between artists and listeners, as well as among the artists. In this study, we infer and quantify causality using a diffusion-regression state-space model that constructs counterfactual outcomes using a set of synthetic controls, which predict potential outcomes in absence of the intervention. Based on large scale experiments spanning over 21 million users and 1 billion streams on a real world streaming platform, our findings suggest that releasing a new track has a positive impact on the popularity of other tracks by the same artist. Interestingly, other related and competing artists also benefit from a new track release, which hints at the presence of a positive platform-effect wherein some artists gain significantly from activities of other artists.</p>

    <h3>Investigating the Impact of Audio States in Music Streaming Sessions (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Mehrotra, Aaron Ng</p>
    <p>Music streaming is inherently sequential in nature, with track sequence information playing a key role in user satisfaction with recommended music. In this work, we investigate the role audio characteristics of music content play in understanding music streaming sessions. Focusing on 18 audio attributes (e.g. dancability, acousticness, energy), we formulate audio transitioning in a session as a multiple changepoint detection problem, and extract latent states of different audio attributes within each session. Based on insights from large scale music streaming data from a popular music streaming platform, we investigate questions around the extent to which audio characteristics fluctuate within streaming sessions, the heterogeneity across different audio attributes and their impact on user satisfaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate the promise of such audio-based characterizing of sessions in better sequencing tracks in a session, and highlight the potential gains in user satisfaction on offer. We discuss implications on the design of track sequencing models, and identify important prediction tasks to further research on the topic.</p>

    <h3>Music Playlist Recommendation via Preference Embedding (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chih-Chun Hsia, Ming-Feng Tsai, Yian Chen, Chih-Ming Chen, Chun-Yao Yang</p>
    <p>Music playlists usually contain some particular musical styles or atmospheres in which users would like to be involved. Music streaming services, such as Spotify, Apple Music, and KKBOX, even allow users to edit and listen to playlists online. While it has been some well-known methods that can nicely model the preference between users and songs, little has been done in the literature to recommend music playlists, each of which can be considered as a set of many individual songs, to users. In the light of this, this paper proposes a preference embedding based on a user-song-playlist graph to learn the preference representations of these three entities. After the embedding process, we then use the learned representations to perform the task of playlist recommendation. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset show that the proposed embedding method outperforms the baseline of popularity; in addition, we also make a comparison with DeepWalk and LINE for the recommendation task, and the results show that the proposed method can stand comparison with the two state-of-the-art graph embedding techniques.</p>

    <h3>Beyond ‘Hitting the Hits’ – Generating Coherent Music Playlist Continuations with the Right Tracks (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Iman Kamehkhosh, Lukas Lerche</p>
    <p>Automated playlist generation is a special form of music recommendation and a common feature of digital music playing applications. A particular challenge of the task is that the recommended items should not only match the general listener’s preference but should also be coherent with the most recently played tracks. In this work, we propose a novel algorithmic approach and optimization scheme to generate playlist continuations that address these requirements. In our approach, we first use collections of shared music playlists, music metadata, and user preferences to select suitable tracks with high accuracy. Next, we apply a generic re-ranking optimization scheme to generate playlist continuations that match the characteristics of the last played tracks. An empirical evaluation on three collections of shared playlists shows that the combination of different input signals helps us to achieve high accuracy during track selection and that the re-ranking technique can both help to balance different quality optimization goals and to further increase accuracy.</p>
