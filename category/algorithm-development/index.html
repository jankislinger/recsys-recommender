    <h3>The MovieLens Beliefs Dataset: Collecting Pre-Choice Data for Online Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guy Aridor, Duarte Goncalves, Daniel Kluver, Ruoyan Kong, Joseph Konstan</p>
    <p>An increasingly important aspect of designing recommender systems involves considering how recommendations will influence consumer choices. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a method for collecting user beliefs about un-experienced items – a critical predictor of choice behavior. We implemented this method on the MovieLens platform, resulting in a rich dataset that combines user ratings, beliefs, and observed recommendations. We document challenges to such data collection, including selection bias in response and limited coverage of the product space. This unique resource empowers researchers to delve deeper into user behavior and analyze user choices absent recommendations, measure the effectiveness of recommendations, and prototype algorithms that leverage user belief data, ultimately leading to more impactful recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Uncovering User Interest from Biased and Noised Watch Time in Video Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Xu, Guohao Cai, Zhenhua Dong, Haiyuan Zhao, Lei Zhang, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
    <p>In micro-video recommendation scenarios, watch time is commonly adopted as an indicator of users’ interest. However, watch time is not only determined by the matching of users’ interests but is affected by other factors. These factors mainly lie in two folds: on the one hand, users tend to spend more time on those charming videos with the growth of the duration (i.e., video length), named as duration bias; on the other hand, it costs people a period of time to judge whether they like the video, named as noisy watching. Consequently, the existence of duration bias and noisy watching make watch time an inadequate label for training a reliable recommendation model. Moreover, current methods focus only on the duration bias and ignore the duration noise, so they do not really uncover the user interest from watch time. In this study, we first analyze the generation mechanism of users’ watch time in a unified causal viewpoint. Unlike current methods, which only notice the duration bias in watch time, we considered the watch time as a mixture of the user’s actual interest, the duration biased watch time, and the noisy watch time. To mitigate both the duration bias and noisy watching, we propose Debiased and Denoised watch time Correction (D$^2$Co), which can be divided into two steps: First, we employ a duration-wise Gaussian Mixture Model plus frequency-weighted moving average for estimating the bias and noise terms; Then we utilize a sensitivity-controlled correction function to separate the user interest from the watch time, which is robust to the estimation error of bias and noise terms. The experiments on two public video recommendation datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Graph Construction for Improving Diversity of Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Te Lei, Yuqing Hou, Huaiwen Wu, Jiale Guo, Qing Zhang, Hengliang Luo, Rui Ye, Yunxing Zhang</p>
    <p>The diversity of recommendation has attracted a lot of attention in recommender systems due to its ability to improve user experience. Most of the diversified recommendation tasks usually exploit user-item interaction records for mining user explicit preferences, while rarely explore the user-item non-interaction records. For diversified recommendations, however, the neglected non-interaction records are especially important for capturing users’ potential interests to improve the diversity of recommendation. Moreover, the majority of diversified recommendation methods run in two stages: first optimizing the users and items embeddings by relevance, then generating the diversified items list by post-processing methods. These methods are not end-to-end thus can hardly reach global optimum. To solve above limitations, we propose an end-to-end Dynamic Diversified Graph framework (DDGraph) which constructs the user-item graph dynamically based on the users and items embeddings. Technically, we initialize a user-item interaction graph and dynamically update the graph by selecting a set of diverse items for each user and building links between the items and user. The selection of diverse items can be achieved by different candidate selection operators. Specifically, we design a Quantile Progressive Candidate Selection (QPCS) operator based on the latent space division. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to diversify recommendation results by dynamic end-to-end graph construction and the QPCS has a higher computational efficiency than other operators. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the DDGraph framework.</p>

    <h3>Item Recommendation on Monotonic Behavior Chains (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mengting Wan, Julian McAuley</p>
    <p>‘Explicit’ and ‘implicit’ feedback in recommender systems have been studied for many years, as two relatively isolated areas. However many real-world systems involve a spectrum of both implicit and explicit signals, ranging from clicks and purchases, to ratings and reviews. A natural question is whether implicit signals (which are dense but noisy) might help to predict explicit signals (which are sparse but reliable), or vice versa. Thus in this paper, we propose an item recommendation framework which jointly models this spectrum of interactions. Our main observation is that in many settings, feedback signals exhibit monotonic dependency structures, i.e., any signal necessarily implies the presence of a weaker (or more implicit) signal (a ‘review’ action implies a ‘purchase’ action, which implies a ‘click’ action, etc.). We refer to these structures as ‘monotonic behavior chains,’ for which we develop new algorithms that exploit these dependencies. Using several new and existing datasets that exhibit a variety of feedback types, we demonstrate the quantitative performance of our approaches. We also perform qualitative analysis to uncover the relationships between different stages of implicit vs. explicit signals.</p>

    <h3>Eliciting Pairwise Preferences in Recommender Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Ricci, Saikishore Kalloori, Rosella Gennari</p>
    <p>Preference data in the form of ratings or likes for items are widely used in many Recommender Systems (RSs). However, previous research has shown that even item comparisons, which generate pairwise preference data, can be used to model user preferences. Moreover, pairwise preferences can be effectively combined with ratings to compute recommendations. In such hybrid approaches, the RS requires to elicit from the user both types of preference data. In this work, we aim at identifying how and when to elicit pairwise preferences, i.e., when this form of user preference data is more meaningful for the user to express and more beneficial for the system. We conducted an online A/B test and compared a rating-only based system variant with another variant that allows the user to enter both types of preferences. Our results demonstrate that pairwise preferences are valuable and useful especially when the user is focusing on a specific type of items and by incorporating pairwise preferences, the system can generate better recommendations than a state of the art rating-only based solution. Additionally, our results indicate that there exists a dependency between the user’s personality and the perceived system usability and the satisfaction for the preference elicitation procedure, which varies if only ratings or a combination of ratings and pairwise preferences are elicited.</p>

    <h3>Using Taste Groups for Collaborative Filtering (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nevin L. Zhang, Farhan Khawar</p>
    <p>Implicit feedback is the simplest form of user feedback that can be used for item recommendation. It is easy to collect and domain independent. However, there is a lack of negative examples. Existing works circumvent this problem by making various assumptions regarding the unconsumed items, which fail to hold when the user did not consume an item because she was unaware of it. In this paper, we propose as a novel method for addressing the lack of negative examples in implicit feedback. The motivation is that if there is a large group of users who share the same taste and none of them consumed an item, then it is highly likely that the item is irrelevant to this taste. We use Hierarchical Latent Tree Analysis(HLTA) to identify taste-based user groups and make recommendations for a user based on her memberships in the groups.</p>

    <h3>Sequential User-based Recurrent Neural Network Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jürgen Ziegler, Tim Donkers, Benedikt Loepp</p>
    <p>Recurrent Neural Networks are powerful tools for modeling sequences. They are flexibly extensible and can incorporate various kinds of information including temporal order. These properties make them well suited for generating sequential recommendations. In this paper, we extend Recurrent Neural Networks by considering unique characteristics of the Recommender Systems domain. One of these characteristics is the explicit notion of the user recommendations are specifically generated for. We show how individual users can be represented in addition to sequences of consumed items in a new type of Gated Recurrent Unit to effectively produce personalized next item recommendations. Offline experiments on two real-world datasets indicate that our extensions clearly improve objective performance when compared to state-of-the-art recommender algorithms and to a conventional Recurrent Neural Network.</p>

    <h3>Explainable Entity-based Recommendations with Knowledge Graphs (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William Cohen, Maxine Eskenazi, Rose Catherine, Kathryn Mazaitis</p>
    <p>Explainable recommendation is an important task. Many methods have been proposed which generate explanations from the content and reviews written for items. When review text is unavailable, generating explanations is still a hard problem. In this paper, we illustrate how explanations can be generated in such a scenario by leveraging external knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs. Our method jointly ranks items and knowledge graph entities using a Personalized PageRank procedure to produce recommendations together with their explanations.</p>

    <h3>Detecting Trending Venues Using Foursquare’s Data (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stephanie Yang, Max Sklar</p>
    <p>Foursquare is a search and discovery tool which helps users discover venues around the world. Much of the data for these recommendations come from its sister app Swarm, which is a location based social network where users can “check in” to places they visit. Older versions of Foursquare had a strongly static component to its recommendations. For instance, the top restaurants in New York City do not vary from month to month, and venues with years of consistently strong signals will dominate search results. In this paper we outline a new algorithm which Foursquare uses in order to discover fresh recommendations. Promoting younger venues with fewer check-ins or older venues with a recent surge of activity increases turnover in our recommen- dations and yields a better user experience</p>

    <h3>Eliciting the Users’ Unknown Preferences (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Neidhardt, Hannes Werthner, Leonhard Seyfang, Rainer Schuster</p>
    <p>Personalized recommendation strongly relies on an accurate model to capture user preferences; eliciting this information is, in general, a hard problem. In the field of tourism this initial profiling becomes even more challenging. It has been shown that particularly in the beginning of the travel decision making process, users themselves are often not conscious of their needs and are not able to express them. In this paper, the basics of a picture-based approach are introduced that aims at revealing implicitly given user preferences. Based on a set of travel related pictures selected by a user, an individual travel profile is deduced. This is accomplished by mapping those pictures onto seven basic factors that reflect different travel behavioral aspects. Also tourism products can be represented by this simple seven factor model. Thus, this model constitutes the basis of our recommendation algorithm. In addition, users experience this non-verbal way of interaction as exiting and inspiring.</p>
