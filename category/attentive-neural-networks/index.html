    <h3>Attentive Neural Architecture Incorporating Song Features For Music Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noveen Sachdeva, Kartik Gupta, Vikram Pudi</p>
    <p>Recommender Systems are an integral part of music sharing platforms. Often the aim of these systems is to increase the time, the user spends on the platform and hence having a high commercial value. The systems which aim at increasing the average time user spends on the platform often need to recommend songs which the user might want to listen to next at each point of time. This is different from recommendation systems which try to predict the item which might of the interest to user at some point in the user lifetime but not necessarily in the very near future. Predicting of next song the user might like requires some kind of modelling of the user interests at the given point of time. Attentive neural networks have been exploiting the sequence in which the items were selected by the user to model the implicit short term interests of the user for the task of next item prediction, however we feel that features of the songs occurring in the sequence could also convey some important information about the short term user interest which only the items cannot. In this direction we propose a novel attentive neural architecture which in addition to sequence of items selected by the user, uses the features of these items to better learn the user short term preferences and recommend next song to the user.</p>
