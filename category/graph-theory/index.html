    <h3>SPARE: Shortest Path Global Item Relations for Efficient Session-based Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Peintner, Eva Zangerle, Amir Reza Mohammadi</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendation aims to predict the next item based on a set of anonymous sessions. Capturing user intent from a short interaction sequence imposes a variety of challenges since no user profiles are available and interaction data is naturally sparse. Recent approaches relying on graph neural networks (GNNs) for session-based recommendation use global item relations to explore collaborative information from different sessions. These methods capture the topological structure of the graph and rely on multi-hop information aggregation in GNNs to exchange information along edges. Consequently, graph-based models suffer from noisy item relations in the training data and introduce high complexity for large item catalogs. We propose to explicitly model the multi-hop information aggregation mechanism over multiple layers via shortest-path edges based on knowledge from the sequential recommendation domain. Our approach does not require multiple layers to exchange information and ignores unreliable item-item relations. Furthermore, to address inherent data sparsity, we are the first to apply supervised contrastive learning by mining data-driven positive and hard negative item samples from the training data. Extensive experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms almost all of the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>Information Interactions in Outcome Prediction: Quantification and Interpretation using Stochastic Block Models (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaël Poux-Médard, Sabine Loudcher, Julien Velcin</p>
    <p>In most real-world applications, it is seldom the case that a result appears independently from an environment. In social networks, users’ behavior results from the people they interact with, news in their feed, or trending topics. In natural language, the meaning of phrases emerges from the combination of words. In general medicine, a diagnosis is established on the basis of the interaction of symptoms. Here, we propose the Interacting Mixed Membership Stochastic Block Model (IMMSBM), which investigates the role of interactions between entities (hashtags, words, memes, etc.) and quantifies their importance within the aforementioned corpora. We find that in inference tasks, taking them into account leads to average relative changes with respect to non-interacting models of up to 150% in the probability of an outcome and greatly improves the predictions performances. Furthermore, their role greatly improves the predictive power of the model. Our findings suggest that neglecting interactions when modeling real-world phenomena might lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn.</p>

    <h3>Recommendations as Graph Explorations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marialena Kyriakidi, Yannis Ioannidis, Georgia Koutrika</p>
    <p>We argue that most recommendation approaches can be abstracted as a graph exploration problem. In particular, we describe a graph-theoretic framework with two primary parts: (a) a recommendation graph, modeling all the elements of an (application) domain from a recommendation perspective, including the subjects and objects of recommendations as well as the relationships between them; (b) a set of path operations, inferring new edges, i.e., implicit or unknown relationships, by traversing and combining paths on the graph. The resulting path algebra model provides an abstraction and a common foundation that is beneficial to three aspects of recommendations: (a) expressive power - expression and subsequent use of several significantly different, existing but also novel recommendation approaches is reduced to parameterizing a unique model; (b) usability - by capturing part of the recommendation mechanisms in the underlying path algebra semantics, specification of recommendation approaches becomes easier and less tedious; (c) processing speed - implementing recommender systems on top of graph engines opens up the door for several optimizations that speed up execution. We demonstrate the above benefits by expressing several categories of recommendation approaches in the path algebra model and benchmarking some of them in a recommender system implemented on top of Neo4J, a widely used graph system.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Sentiment Homophily for Link Prediction (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Munindar Singh, Pradeep Murukannaiah, Guangchao Yuan, Zhe Zhang</p>
    <p>Link prediction system has been extensively studied and adopted to recommendation systems on social media. With the increasing popularity of sentiment analysis on social network, knowing the relationship between users’ sentiments and link prediction is important. In this paper, we study how to exploit sentiment homophily in link prediction. We have gathered political campaign dataset of one-month on Twitter. We define a set of sentiment-based features that quantify the likelihood of two users becoming friends based on their sentiments toward topics. Our evaluation in a supervised learning framework demonstrates the benefits of sentiment-based features in link prediction. Further, Adamic-Adar and Euclidean distance based measures are the best predictors. We propose a factor graph model that incorporates the sentiment-based cognitive balance theory. Our evaluation shows how our model offers help in link prediction on different kinds of graphs, compared to traditional machine learning techniques. Our work offers new insights for real-world link recommendation systems.</p>
