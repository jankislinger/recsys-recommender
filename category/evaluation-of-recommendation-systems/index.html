    <h3>Style Conditioned Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamelia Aryafar, Murium Iqbal, Timothy Anderton</p>
    <p>We propose Style Conditioned Recommendations (SCR) and introduce style injection as a method to diversify recommendations. We use Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) architecture, where both the encoder and decoder are conditioned on a user profile learned from item content data. This allows us to apply style transfer methodologies to the task of recommendations, which we refer to as injection. To enable style injection, user profiles are learned to be interpretable such that they express users’ propensities for specific predefined styles. These are learned via label-propagation from a dataset of item content, with limited labeled points. To perform injection, the condition on the encoder is learned while the condition on the decoder is selected per explicit feedback. Explicit feedback can be taken either from a user’s response to a style or interest quiz, or from item ratings. In the absence of explicit feedback, the condition at the encoder is applied to the decoder. We show a 12% improvement on NDCG@20 over the traditional VAE based approach on the task of recommendations. We show an average 22% improvement on AUC across all classes for predicting user style profiles against our best performing baseline. After injecting styles we compare the user style profile to the style of the recommendations and show that injected styles have an average +133% increase in presence. Our results show that style injection is a powerful method to diversify recommendations while maintaining personal relevance. Our main contribution is an application of a semi-supervised approach that extends item labels to interpretable user profiles.</p>

    <h3>CF4CF: Recommending Collaborative Filtering algorithms using Collaborative Filtering (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiago Cunha, Carlos Soares, André de Carvalho</p>
    <p>As Collaborative Filtering becomes increasingly important in both academia and industry recommendation solutions, it also becomes imperative to study the algorithm selection task in this domain. This problem aims at finding automatic solutions which enable the selection of the best algorithms for a new problem, without performing full-fledged training and validation procedures. Existing work in this area includes several approaches using Metalearning, which relate the characteristics of the problem domain with the performance of the algorithms. This study explores an alternative approach to deal with this problem. Since, in essence, the algorithm selection problem is a recommendation problem, we investigate the use of Collaborative Filtering algorithms to select Collaborative Filtering algorithms. The proposed approach integrates subsampling landmarkers, a data characterization approach commonly used in Metalearning, with a Collaborative Filtering methodology, named CF4CF. The predictive performance obtained by CF4CF using benchmark recommendation datasets was similar or superior to that obtained with Metalearning.</p>

    <h3>Chemical Reactant Recommendation using a Network of Organic Chemistry (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ernesto Diaz-Aviles, Carlos Alzate, Akihiro Kishimoto, John Savage, Beat Buesser</p>
    <p>This paper presents recommendation algorithms for novel applications in chemistry. We focus on the task of recommending to the chemist candidate molecules (reactants) necessary to synthesize a given target molecule (product), which is an important step for the chemist to find a synthesis route to generate the product. We formulate this task as a link-prediction problem over a so-called Network of Organic Chemistry (NOC) that we have constructed from 8 million chemical reactions described in the US patent literature between 1976 and 2013. We leverage state-of-the-art factorization algorithms for recommender systems to solve this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Factorization Machines, trained with chemistry-specific knowledge, outperforms current methods based on similarity of chemical structures.</p>

    <h3>Context-Aware Event Recommendation in Event-based Social Networks (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leandro B. Marinho, Rodrygo L. T. Santos, Augusto Q. Macedo</p>
    <p>The Web has grown into one of the most important channels to communicate social events nowadays. However, the sheer volume of events available in event-based social networks (EBSNs) often undermines the users’ ability to choose the events that best fit their interests. Recommender systems appear as a natural solution for this problem, but differently from classic recommendation scenarios (e.g. movies, books), the event recommendation problem is intrinsically cold-start. Indeed, events published in EBSNs are typically short-lived and, by definition, are always in the future, having little or no trace of historical attendance. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit several contextual signals available from EBSNs. In particular, besides content-based signals based on the events’ description and collaborative signals derived from users’ RSVPs, we exploit social signals based on group memberships, location signals based on the users’ geographical preferences, and temporal signals derived from the users’ time preferences. Moreover, we combine the proposed signals for learning to rank events for personalized recommendation. Thorough experiments using a large crawl of Meetup.com demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed contextual learning approach in contrast to state-of-the-art event recommenders from the literature.</p>

    <h3>Cross-Domain Recommendations Without Overlapping Data: Myth or Reality? (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Cremonesi, Massimo Quadrana</p>
    <p>Cross-domain recommender systems adopt different tech- niques to transfer learning from source domain to target domain in order to alleviate the sparsity problem and improve accuracy of recommendations. Traditional techniques require the two domains to be linked by shared characteristics associated to either users or items. In collaborative-filtering (CF) this happens when the two domains have overlapping users or item (at least partially). Recently, Li et al. [7] introduced codebook transfer (CBT), a cross-domain CF technique based on co-clustering, and presented experimental results showing that CBT is able to transfer knowledge between non-overlapping domains. In this paper, we disprove these results and show that CBT does not transfer useful knowledge when source and target domains do not overlap.</p>
