    <h3>Positive-Sum Impact of Multistakeholder Recommender Systems for Urban Tourism Promotion and User Utility (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Ricci, Pavel Merinov</p>
    <p>We explore how multistakeholder recommender systems (MRSs) can impact urban tourism promotion. Usually, two conflicting goals are of interest: (i) to cut down the number of visitors at popular sites and (ii) to satisfy individual tourist preferences, often biased towards popular sites. By leveraging users’ limited knowledge of the sites catalogue, we model and simulate interactions between tourists and an MRS that jointly optimises user utility and promotes less popular sites. Experiments based on data logs collected in tourist cities reveal that an MRS can lift user utility and at the same time reduce the number of visitors at popular sites, manifesting the so-called positive-sum impact. However, a delicate balance is crucial; under- or over-promotion of unpopular sites in recommendation lists can be adverse to both destination and user utilities.</p>

    <h3>RPAF: A Reinforcement Prediction-Allocation Framework for Cache Allocation in Large-Scale Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiqiao Zhan, Kun Gai, Xiaoshuang Chen, Yao Wang, Ziqiang Zhang, Ben Wang, Yulin Wu, Shuo Su</p>
    <p>Modern recommender systems are built upon computation-intensive infrastructure, and it is challenging to perform real-time computation for each request, especially in peak periods, due to the limited computational resources. Recommending by user-wise result caches is widely used when the system cannot afford a real-time recommendation. However, it is challenging to allocate real-time and cached recommendations to maximize the users’ overall engagement. This paper shows two key challenges to cache allocation, i.e., the temporal dependency and the streaming allocation. Then, we propose a reinforcement prediction-allocation framework (RPAF) to address these issues. RPAF is a reinforcement-learning-based two-stage framework containing prediction and allocation stages. The prediction stage estimates the values of the cache choices considering the strategy and value dependencies, while the allocation stage determines the cache choices for each request. We show that the challenge of training RPAF includes globality and the strictness of budget constraints, and a relaxed local allocator (RLA) is proposed to address this issue. Moreover, a PoolRank algorithm is used in the allocation stage to deal with the streaming allocation problem. Experiments show that RPAF significantly improves users’ engagement under computational budget constraints.</p>

    <h3>Navigating the Feedback Loop in Recommender Systems: Insights and Strategies from Industry Practice (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ding Tong, Justin Basilico, James McInerney, Ting-Po Lee, Qifeng Qiao</p>
    <p>Understanding and measuring the impact of feedback loops in industrial recommender systems is challenging, leading to the underestimation of the deterioration. In this study, we define open and closed feedback loops and investigate the unique reasons behind the emergence of feedback loops in the industry, drawing from real-world examples that have received limited attention in prior research. We highlight the measurement challenges associated with capturing the full impact of feedback loops using traditional online A/B tests. To address this, we propose the use of offline evaluation frameworks as surrogates for long-term feedback loop bias, supported by a practical simulation system using real data. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the performance of recommender systems operating under feedback loop conditions.</p>

    <h3>Evaluation Framework for Cold-Start Techniques in Large-Scale Production Settings (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moran Haham</p>
    <p>In recommender systems, cold-start issues are situations where no previous events (e.g., ratings), are known for certain users or items. Mitigating cold-start situations is a fundamental problem in almost any recommender system [3, 5]. In real-life, large-scale production systems, the challenge of optimizing the cold-start strategy is even greater. We present an end-to-end framework for evaluating and comparing different cold-start strategies. By applying this framework in Outbrain’s recommender system, we were able to reduce our cold-start costs by half, while supporting both offline and online settings. Our framework solves the pain of benchmarking numerous cold-start techniques using surrogate accuracy metrics on offline datasets - coupled with an extensive, cost-controlled online A/B test. In this abstract, We’ll start with a short introduction to the cold-start challenge in recommender systems. Next, we will explain the motivation for a framework for cold-start techniques. Lastly, we will then describe - step by step - how we used the framework to reduce our exploration by more than 50%.</p>

    <h3>A Field Study of Related Video Recommendations: Newest, Most Similar, or Most Relevant (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Maxwell Harper, Yifan Zhong, Qian Zhao, Vikas Kumar, Tahir Lazaro Sousa Menezes</p>
    <p>Many video sites recommend videos related to the one a user is watching. These recommendations have been shown to influence what users end up exploring and are an important part of a recommender system. Plenty of methods have been proposed to recommend related videos, but there has been relatively little work that compares competing strategies. We describe a field study of related video recommendations, where we deploy algorithms to recommend related videos in a movie trailer viewing interface. Our results show that non-personalized algorithms yield the highest click-through rates, while the algorithm prioritizing recency is the strongest in leading to trailer-level user engagement. Our findings suggest the potential to design non-personalized yet effective related item recommendation strategies.</p>

    <h3>Offline and Online Evaluation of News Recommender Systems at swissinfo.ch (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Donatsch, Amr Huber, Florent Garcin, Boi Faltings, Ayar Alazzawi, Christophe Bruttin</p>
    <p>We report on the live evaluation of various news recommender systems conducted on the website swissinfo.ch. We demonstrate that there is a major difference between offline and online accuracy evaluations. In an offline setting, recommending most popular stories is the best strategy, while in a live environment this strategy is the poorest. For online setting, context-tree recommender systems which profile the users in real-time improve the click-through rate by up to 35%. The visit length also increases by a factor of 2.5. Our experience holds important lessons for the evaluation of recommender systems with offline data as well as for the use of the click-through rate as a performance indicator.</p>
