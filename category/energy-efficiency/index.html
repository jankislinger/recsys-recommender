    <h3>Towards Green Recommender Systems: Investigating the Impact of Data Reduction on Carbon Footprint and Algorithm Performances (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michela Milano, Cataldo Musto, Allegra De Filippo, Giuseppe Spillo, Giovanni Semeraro</p>
    <p>This work investigates the path toward green recommender systems by examining the impact of data reduction on both model performance and carbon footprint. In the pursuit of developing energy-efficient recommender systems, we investigated whether and how reducting training data impacts the performances of several representative recommendation models. In order to obtain a fair comparison, all the models were run based on the implementations available in a popular recommendation library, i.e., RecBole, and used the same experimental settings. Results indicate that: (a) data reduction can be a promising strategy to make recommender systems more sustainable at the cost of a lower accuracy; (b) training recommender systems with less data makes the suggestions more diverse and less biased. Overall, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the development of recommendation models that meet the principles of SDGs, laying the groundwork for the adoption of more sustainable practices in the field.</p>

    <h3>DNS-Rec: Data-aware Neural Architecture Search for Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Zhang, Xiangyu Zhao, Ruocheng Guo, Sheng Zhang, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu, Yao Zhao, Hongzhi Yin, Maolin Wang</p>
    <p>In the era of data proliferation, efficiently sifting through vast information to extract meaningful insights has become increasingly crucial. This paper addresses the computational and resource inefficiencies prevalent in existing Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs). However, existing SRSs are often plagued by significant computational overhead and resource inefficiency during the inference stage. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative approach combining pruning methods with advanced model designs. Furthermore, we delve into resource-constrained Neural Architecture Search (NAS), an emerging technique in recommender systems, to optimize models in terms of FLOPs, latency, and energy consumption while maintaining or enhancing accuracy. Our principal contribution is the development of a Data-aware Neural Architecture Search for Recommender System (DNS-Rec). DNS-Rec is specifically designed to tailor compact network architectures for attention-based SRS models, thereby ensuring accuracy retention. It incorporates data-aware gates to enhance the performance of the recommendation network by learning information from historical user-item interactions. Moreover, DNS-Rec employs a dynamic resource constraint strategy, stabilizing the search process and yielding more suitable architectural solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through rigorous experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets, which highlight the superiority of DNS-Rec in SRSs. Our findings set a new standard for future research in efficient and accurate recommendation systems, marking a significant step forward in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

    <h3>Personal Values and Community-Centric Environmental Recommender Systems: enhancing Sustainability through User Engagement (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bianca Maria Deconcini</p>
    <p>The concept of sustainability has become a central focus across multiple sectors, driven by the urgent need to address climate change and protect the environment. Technological advancements and capabilities, together with the emergence of new ecological issues, are leading to growing awareness and influencing shifts in multiple areas such as energy, transportation, and waste management. Within this context, the roles of recommender systems represent a promising solution, since people need guidance and occasionally a gentle push to translate their intentions into actions or to bring goals to life. However, existing literature reveals a fragmented landscape, with solutions often addressing specific aspects or recommendation contribution in isolation. Many sustainability interventions focus solely on providing consumption data and environmental insights, while others emphasize learning and behavior change strategies. My doctoral project aims to address this gap by leveraging various approaches to recommender systems and applying them in sustainability contexts, with the goal to build a holistic system that maximizes the contributions of these diverse methods, also integrating user-centric and value-driven perspectives. This research project delves into two distinct facets: energy sustainability and sustainable mobility. The first case centers on enhancing energy efficiency within energy communities through personalized recommendations and engagement strategies. The second facet focuses on reshaping user commuting patterns towards sustainable alternatives, by recommending suitable and more sustainable modes of transportation, such as cycling, carpooling, and public transportation. Both cases share the same objective: align user behaviors with sustainability goals, thereby reducing individual environmental impact and enhancing the sense of belonging to a community, whether this is confined to a group of individuals or pertains to society at large. An innovative comprehensive recommendation system approach is highly beneficial since it can take advantage of all the existing contributions combined in a framework that makes at the same time different types of recommendations: explainable, educative, behavioral and social-aware, addressing the complexities of this multifaceted domain.</p>

    <h3>Reducing Energy Waste in Households Through Real-Time Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iraklis Varlamis, Akshay Anil Pagar, Janhavi Dahihande, Ajinkya Thakare, Magdalini Eirinaki, Akshay Anil Jaiswal</p>
    <p>The energy consumption of households has steadily increased over the last couple of decades. Research suggests that user behavior is the most influential factor in the energy waste of a household. Thus, there’s a need for helping consumers change their behavior to make it more energy efficient and environment friendly. In this work we propose a real-time recommender system that assists consumers in improving their household’s energy usage. By monitoring the power demand of each appliance in the household, the system detects the device status (on/off) at any moment, and using pattern mining creates a household profile comprising energy consumption patterns for different periods of the day. An intuitive UI allows users to set energy consumption goals and preferences on the appliances they’d like to save energy from. Based on the household profile, the user’s preferences and the actual power demand the system generates personalized real-time recommendations on which appliances should be turned off at a moment. We employ the UK-DALE (UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity) dataset to model and evaluate the entire process, from data preprocessing and transformation of the appliance power demand input to various pattern mining algorithms used to generate appliance usage profiles and recommendations, showing that even small changes in appliance usage behavior can lead to energy savings between 2-17%.</p>

    <h3>Effective User Interface Designs to Increase Energy-efficient Behavior in a Rasch-based Energy Recommender System (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alain Starke, Chris Snijders, Martijn Willemsen</p>
    <p>People often struggle to find appropriate energy-saving measures to take in the household. Although recommender studies show that tailoring a system’s interaction method to the domain knowledge of the user can increase energy savings, they did not actually tailor the conservation advice itself. We present two large user studies in which we support users to make an energy-efficient behavioral change by presenting tailored energy-saving advice. Both systems use a one-dimensional, ordinal Rasch scale, which orders 79 energy-saving measures on their behavioral difficulty and link this to a user’s energy-saving ability for tailored advice. We established that recommending Rasch-based advice can reduce a user’s effort, increase system support and, in turn, increase choice satisfaction and lead to the adoption of more energy-saving measures. Moreover, follow-up surveys four weeks later point out that tailoring advice on its feasibility can lead to behavioral change.</p>
