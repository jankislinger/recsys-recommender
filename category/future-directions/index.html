    <h3>Why the Shooting in the Dark Method Dominates Recommender Systems Practice (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Rohde</p>
    <p>The introduction of A/B Testing represented a great leap forward in recommender systems research. Like the randomized control trial for evaluating drug efficacy; A/B Testing has equipped recommender systems practitioners with a protocol for measuring performance as defined by actual business metrics and with minimal assumptions. While A/B testing provided a way to measure the performance of two or more candidate systems, it provides no guide for determining what policy we should test. The focus of this industry talk is to better understand, why the development of A/B testing was the last great leap forward in the development of reward optimizing recommender systems despite more than a decade of efforts in both industry and academia. The talk will survey: industry best practice, standard theories and tools including: collaborative filtering (MovieLens RecSys), contextual bandits, attribution, off-policy estimation, causal inference, click through rate models and will explain why we have converged on a fundamentally heuristic solution or guess and check type method. The talk will offer opinions about which of these theories are useful, and which are not and make a concrete proposal to make progress based on a non-standard use of deep learning tools.</p>

    <h3>Integrating Matrix Factorization with Graph based Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rachana Mehta</p>
    <p>Graph based Recommender models make use of user-item rating and user-user social relationships to elicit recommendation performance by extracting inherent geometrical knowledge. In a social graph scenario, user-user trust plays a significant role in reducing sparsity and has varied characteristics that can be exploited. Existing models limit themselves to learning from either a high order interaction graph of user-item ratings or a user-user social graph from trust value. They explore other trust characteristics in a very limited setting. The graph based model, designed using entire user-user social information, impacts performance and escalates complexities in model learning. To alleviate these issues of graph learning, graph recommender seeks assistance from matrix factorization techniques. Incorporating graph based model with matrix factorization brings its own set of challenges of model integration, leveraging trust, graph learning, and optimization. This article presents the existing work in that line and future possibilities and challenges to be catered to through novel developments</p>

    <h3>Explainable Multi-Stakeholder Job Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roan Schellingerhout</p>
    <p>Public opinion on recommender systems has become increasingly wary in recent years. In line with this trend, lawmakers have also started to become more critical of such systems, resulting in the introduction of new laws focusing on aspects such as privacy, fairness, and explainability for recommender systems and AI at large. These concepts are especially crucial in high-risk domains such as recruitment. In recruitment specifically, decisions carry substantial weight, as the outcomes can significantly impact individuals’ careers and companies’ success. Additionally, there is a need for a multi-stakeholder approach, as these systems are used by job seekers, recruiters, and companies simultaneously, each with its own requirements and expectations. In this paper, I summarize my current research on the topic of explainable, multi-stakeholder job recommender systems and set out a number of future research directions.</p>

    <h3>Causal Inference on Recommender Systems (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Blei, Yixin Wang, Laurent Charlin, Dawen Liang</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have become crucial in information filtering nowadays. Existing recommender systems extract user preferences based on the correlation in data, such as behavioral correlation in collaborative filtering, feature-feature, or feature-behavior correlation in click-through rate prediction. However, unfortunately, the real world is driven by causality, not just correlation, and correlation does not imply causation. For instance, recommender systems might recommend a battery charger to a user after buying a phone, where the latter can serve as the cause of the former; such a causal relation cannot be reversed. Recently, to address this, researchers in recommender systems have begun utilizing causal inference to extract causality, thereby enhancing the recommender system. In this survey, we offer a comprehensive review of the literature on causal inference-based recommendation. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts of both recommender system and causal inference as the foundation for subsequent content. We then highlight the typical issues faced by non-causality recommender system. Following that, we thoroughly review the existing work on causal inference-based recommender systems, based on a taxonomy of three-aspect challenges that causal inference can address. Finally, we discuss the open problems in this critical research area and suggest important potential future works.</p>

    <h3>Recommendations with a Purpose (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Gediminas Adomavicius</p>
    <p>The purpose of recommenders is often summarized as “help the users find relevant items”, and the predominant operationalization of this goal has been to focus on the ability to numerically estimate the users’ preferences for unseen items or to provide users with item lists ranked in accordance to the estimated preferences. This dominant, albeit narrow, view of the recommendation problem has been tremendously helpful in advancing research in different ways, e.g., through the establishment of standardized evaluation procedures and metrics. In reality, recommender systems can serve a variety of purposes from the point of view of both consumers and providers. Most of the purposes, however, are significantly underexplored, even though many of them are arguably more aligned with the real-world expectations for recommenders than our current predominant paradigm. Therefore, it is important to revisit our conceptualizations of the potential goals of recommenders and their operationalization as research problems. In this paper, we discuss a framework of recommendation goals and purposes and highlight possible future directions and challenges related to the operationalization of such alternative problem formulations.</p>

    <h3>Algorithms Aside: Recommendation As The Lens Of Life (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marko Tkalcic, Paolo Cremonesi, Anna Zacchi, Ayse Göker, Daniel Kohlsdorf, Davide Malagoli, Jean-Yves Le Moine, Martha Larson, Francesco Ricci, Domonkos Tikk, Andreas Lommatzsch, Thuy Ngoc Nguyen, Tamas Motajcsek, Jasminko Novak, Kristaps Dobrajs, Franca Garzotto, Omar Alonso, Andrew Demetriou, Frank Hopfgartner, Mario Scriminaci</p>
    <p>In this position paper, we take the experimental approach of putting algorithms aside, and reflect on what recommenders would be for people if they were not tied to technology. By looking at some of the shortcomings that current recommenders have fallen into and discussing their limitations from a human point of view, we ask the question: if freed from all limitations, what should, and what could, RecSys be? We then turn to the idea that life itself is the best recommender system, and that people themselves are the query. By looking at how life brings people in contact with options that suit their needs or match their preferences, we hope to shed further light on what current RecSys could be doing better. Finally, we look at the forms that RecSys could take in the future. By formulating our vision beyond the reach of usual considerations and current limitations, including business models, algorithms, data sets, and evaluation methodologies, we attempt to arrive at fresh conclusions that may inspire the next steps taken by the community of researchers working on RecSys.</p>
