    <h3>Data Augmentation using Reverse Prompt for Cost-Efficient Cold-Start Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Genki Kusano</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems that use auxiliary information such as product names and categories have been proposed to address the cold-start problem. However, these methods do not perform well when we only have insufficient warm-start training data. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can perform as effective cold-start recommendation systems even with limited warm-start data. However, they require numerous API calls for inferences, which leads to high operational costs in terms of time and money. This is a significant concern in industrial applications. In this paper, we introduce a new method, RevAug, which leverages LLMs as a data augmentation to enhance cost-efficient cold-start recommendation systems. To generate pseudo-samples, we have reversed the commonly used prompt for an LLM from “Would this user like this item?” to “What kind of items would this user like?”. Generated outputs by this reverse prompt are pseudo-auxiliary information utilized to enhance recommendation systems in the training phase. In numerical experiments with four real-world datasets, RevAug demonstrated superior performance in cold-start settings with limited warm-start data compared to existing methods. Moreover, RevAug significantly reduced API fees and processing time compared to an LLM-based recommendation method.</p>

    <h3>Short-form Video Needs Long-term Interests: An Industrial Solution for Serving Large User Sequence Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Most, Yuening Li, Qingyun Liu, Liang Liu, Xinyang Yi, Junjie Shan, Shuchao Bi, Lichan Hong, Chuan He, Jiaxi Tang, Diego Uribe, Kaushik Kalyan, Ed Chi</p>
    <p>Sequential models are invaluable for powering personalized recommendation systems. In the context of short-form video (SFV) feeds, where user behavior history is typically longer, there’s a need for a system to handle users’ long-term interests. However, deploying large sequence models to extensive web-scale applications faces challenges due to high serving cost. To address this, we propose an industrial framework designed for efficiently serving large user sequence models. Specifically, the proposed infrastructure decouples the serving of user sequence model and the main recommendation model, with user sequence model served offline (in an asynchronous manner) with periodical refresh. The proposed infrastructure is also model-agnostic; thus, it can be used to support any types of user sequence models (even LLMs) with controllable costs. Empirical results show that large user models deployed with our framework significantly and consistently enhances the quality of the main recommendation model, with minimal serving costs increase.</p>

    <h3>Uncovering ChatGPT’s Capabilities in Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihua Si, Chen Xu, Haiyuan Zhao, Xiao Zhang, Weijie Yu, Zhongxiang Sun, Jun Xu, Ninglu Shao, Sunhao Dai</p>
    <p>The debut of ChatGPT has recently attracted significant attention from the natural language processing (NLP) community and beyond. Existing studies have demonstrated that ChatGPT shows significant improvement in a range of downstream NLP tasks, but the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in terms of recommendations remain unclear. In this study, we aim to enhance ChatGPT’s recommendation capabilities by aligning it with traditional information retrieval (IR) ranking capabilities, including point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise ranking. To achieve this goal, we re-formulate the aforementioned three recommendation policies into prompt formats tailored specifically to the domain at hand.  Through extensive experiments on four datasets from different domains, we analyze the distinctions among the three recommendation policies. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT achieves an optimal balance between cost and performance when equipped with list-wise ranking. This research sheds light on a promising direction for aligning ChatGPT with recommendation tasks.

    <h3>Online Learning for Recommendations at Grubhub (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Egg</p>
    <p>We propose a method to easily modify existing offline Recommender Systems to run online using Transfer Learning. Online Learning for Recommender Systems has two main advantages: quality and scale. Like many Machine Learning algorithms in production if not regularly retrained will suffer from Concept Drift. A policy that is updated frequently online can adapt to drift faster than a batch system. This is especially true for user-interaction systems like recommenders where the underlying distribution can shift drastically to follow user behaviour. As a platform grows rapidly like Grubhub, the cost of running batch training jobs becomes material. A shift from stateless batch learning offline to stateful incremental learning online can recover, for example, at Grubhub, up to a 45x cost savings and a +20% metrics increase. There are a few challenges to overcome with the transition to online stateful learning, namely convergence, non-stationary embeddings and off-policy evaluation, which we explore from our experiences running this system in production.</p>
