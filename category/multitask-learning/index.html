    <h3>MARRS: A Framework for multi-objective risk-aware route recommendation using Multitask-Transformer (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bhumika ., Debasis Das</p>
    <p>One of the most significant map services in navigation applications is route recommendation. However, most route recommendation systems only recommend trips based on time and distance, impacting quality-of-experience and route selection. This paper introduces a novel framework, namely MARRS, a multi-objective route recommendation system based on heterogeneous urban sensing open data (i.e., crime, accident, traffic flow, road network, meteorological, calendar event, and point of interest distributions). We introduce a wide, deep, and multitask-learning (WD-MTL) framework that uses a transformer to extract spatial, temporal, and semantic correlation for predicting crime, accident, and traffic flow of particular road segment. Later, for a particular source and destination, the adaptive epsilon constraint technique is used to optimize route satisfying multiple objective functions. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of figuring out the safest and efficient route selection.</p>

    <h3>Select and Predict: Multitask Learning for Recommender Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guy Hadash, Rita Osadchy, Oren Sar Shalom</p>
    <p>The two main tasks in the Recommender Systems domain are the selection and prediction tasks. The prediction task aims at predicting to what extent a user would like any given item, which would enable to recommend the items with the highest predicted scores. The selection task on the other hand directly aims at recommending the most valuable items for the user. Several Multitask Learning approaches have been proposed to learn user and item representations that optimize both tasks simultaneously. In this work, we propose a novel framework that exploits the fact that a user first decides to interact with an item (selection task) and afterward to rate it (prediction task). We evaluated our framework on 2 benchmark datasets, on 2 different configurations and show its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>A Crowdsourcing Triage Algorithm for Geopolitical Forecasting (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Huber, Tsai-Ching Lu, Mohammad Rostami</p>
    <p>Predicting the outcome of geopolitical events is of huge importance to many organizations, as these forecasts provide actionable intelligence that may be used to make consequential decisions. Prediction polling is a common method used in crowdsourcing platforms for geopolitical forecasting, where a group of non-expert participants are asked to predict the outcome of a geopolitical event and the collected responses are aggregated to generate a forecast. It has been demonstrated that forecasts by such a crowd can be more accurate than the forecasts of experts. However, geopolitical prediction polling is challenging because participants are highly heterogeneous and diverse in terms of their skills and background knowledge and human resources are often limited. As a result, it is crucial to refer each question to the subset of participants that possess suitable skills to answer it, such that individual efforts are not wasted. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on multitask learning to learn the skills of participants of a forecasting platform by using their performance history. The learned model then can be used to recommend suitable questions to forecasters. Our experimental results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy can be increased based on the proposed algorithm as opposed to when questions have been randomly assigned.</p>
