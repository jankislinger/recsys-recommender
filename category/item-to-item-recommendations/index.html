    <h3>Is It Really Complementary? Revisiting Behavior-based Labels for Complementary Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazushi Okamoto, Kai Sugahara, Chihiro Yamasaki</p>
    <p>Complementary recommendation is a type of item-to-item recommendation that recommends what should be purchased together for an item. Previous studies have traditionally used behavior-based labels (BBLs) that are constructed from the co-purchase logs of users for training and evaluation because rigorous label construction for complements is inefficient. However, the fact that many item pairs in BBLs are not functionally complementary, even though they are frequently co-purchased, has been overlooked. This study aimed to re-evaluate the validity of BBLs through functional relationships and provide directions for their improvement. Quantitative analysis using manually annotated function-based labels (FBLs) as correct labels revealed that the accuracy of the complementary recommendations generated by BBLs was below 50%, suggesting potential functional incompatibility within BBLs. Existing models that were trained on BBLs were similarly inaccurate, indicating the unreliability of the evaluations in existing studies. Finally, we proposed a label correction method for BBLs using a small set of FBLs, thereby providing a direction for reliable complementary recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Identifying Controversial Pairs in Item-to-Item Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Goodman Gu, Sindhu Vijaya Raghavan, Junyi Shen, Rob Monarch, Jin Cao, Dayvid Rodrigues de Oliveira, Brian Knott</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems in large-scale online marketplaces are essential to aiding users in discovering new content. However, state-of-the-art systems for item-to-item recommendation tasks are often based on a shallow level of contextual relevance, which can make the system insufficient for tasks where item relationships are more nuanced. Contextually relevant item pairs can sometimes have controversial or problematic relationships, and they could degrade user experiences and brand perception when recommended to users. For example, a  recommendation of a divorce and co-parenting book can create a disturbing experience for someone who is downloading or viewing a marriage therapy book. In this paper, we propose a classifier to identify and prevent such problematic item-to-item recommendations and to enhance overall user experiences. The proposed approach utilizes active learning to sample hard examples effectively across sensitive item categories and uses human raters for data labeling. We also perform offline experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of this system for identifying and filtering controversial recommendations while maintaining recommendation quality.</p>

    <h3>Debiasing Item-to-Item Recommendations With Small Annotated Datasets (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Schnabel, Paul N. Bennett</p>
    <p>Item-to-item recommendation (e.g., “People who like this also like...”) is a ubiquitous and important type of recommendation in real-world systems. Observational data from historical interaction logs abound in these settings. However, since virtually all observational data exhibit biases, such as time-in-inventory or interface biases, it is crucial that recommender algorithms account for these biases. In this paper, we develop a principled approach for item-to-item recommendation based on causal inference and present a practical and highly effective method for estimating the causal parameters from a small annotated dataset. Empirically, we find that our approach substantially improves upon existing methods while requiring only small amounts of annotated data.</p>

    <h3>Query as Context for Item-to-Item Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moumita Bhattacharya</p>
    <p>Recommender Systems is one of the main machine learning applications for an e-commerce platforms such as Etsy, a two sided marketplace. A frequent usage of such system is for item-to-item recommendations that show similar items (also referred as listings) based on the listing a user is currently viewing. Item-to-item recommendations typically take into account information that are only associated with the target listing and other listings in the inventory. However, other contextual information such as user intents, queries and seasonality, are often not taken into account. In this talk, we will present two approaches we developed to utilize additional contextual information in the form of queries in generating item-to-item recommendations. Moreover, we will present our journey in migrating Etsy’s rankers from linear to non-linear models. Additionally, we propose new metrics to evaluate candidate sets that accesses diversity and price spread, while not compromising relevance. The proposed metrics can also be used beyond the current application. Our proposed candidate set generation approach outperforms the model in production as well as yielding significant lift in conversion rate and other engagement metrics as indicated by several A/B tests.</p>

    <h3>Do Users Matter? The Contribution of User-Driven Feature Weights to Open Dataset Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anusuriya Devaraju, Shlomo Berkovsky</p>
    <p>The vast volumes of open data pose a challenge for users in finding relevant datasets. To address this, we developed a hybrid dataset recommendation model that combines content-based similarity with item-to-item co-occurrence. The features used by the recommender include dataset properties and usage statistics. In this paper, we focus on fi ne-tuning the weights of these features. We experimentally compare two feature weighting approaches: a uniform one with predefined weights and a user-driven one, where the weights are informed by the opinions of system users. We evaluated the two approaches in a study, involving the users of a real-life data portal. The results suggest that user-driven feature weights can improve dataset recommendations, although not at all levels of data relevance, and highlight the importance of incorporating target users in the design of recommender systems.</p>
