    <h3>Towards Understanding The Gaps of Offline And Online Evaluation Metrics: Impact of Series vs. Movie Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashok Chandrashekar, Puja Das, Bora Edizel, Tim Sweetser, Kamilia Ahmadi</p>
    <p>In the realm of recommender systems research, offline evaluation metrics like NDCG, Recall, or Precision are often used to measure the impact. On the other hand, common industry practices suggest evaluating new ideas/models through A/B tests where decisions are made based on business metrics like the overall engagement of users. A new model may show improvement in offline metrics but performance loss in online metrics. One reason that leads to this phenomenon is the counterfactual nature of the recommendation problem which can be addressed by off-policy evaluation methods. Another reason is the degree of causal connection between offline evaluation metrics and observed online metrics. In this work, we will share our learnings from two sets of A/B tests that we conducted at Max1 where we observed a mismatch between online and offline metrics due to a weak causal connection between online and offline metrics. Thanks to learnings from A/B tests, we discovered and quantified the impact of series to movie ratio at recommendations. Our experiments show that there is an optimal amount of series to movies ratio that provides the best possible results for user engagement</p>

    <h3>Client Time Series Model: a Multi-Target Recommender System based on Temporally-Masked Encoders (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dirk Sierag, Kevin Zielnicki</p>
    <p>Stitch Fix, an online personal shopping and styling service, creates a personalized shopping experience to meet any purchase occasion across multiple platforms. For example, a client who wants more one-on-one support in shopping for an outfit or look can request a stylist to curate a ‘Fix’, an assortment of 5 items; or they can browse their own personalized shop and make direct purchases in our ‘Freestyle’ experience. We know that personal style changes and evolves over time, so in order to provide the client with the most personalized and dynamic experience across platforms, it is important to recommend items based on our holistic and real-time understanding of their style across all of our platforms. This work introduces the Client Time Series Model (CTSM), a scalable and efficient recommender system based on Temporally-Masked Encoders (TME) that learns one client embedding across all platforms, yet is able to provide distinctive recommendations depending on the platform. An A/B test showed that our model outperformed the baseline model by 5.8% in terms of expected revenue.</p>

    <h3>E-commerce Recommendation with Personalized Promotion (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fangfang Tan, Daniel Friedman, Yi Zhang, Qi Zhao</p>
    <p>Most existing e-commerce recommender systems aim to recommend the right products to a consumer, assuming the properties of each product are fixed. However, some properties, including price discount, can be personalized to respond to each consumer’s preference. This paper studies how to automatically set the price discount when recommending a product, in light of the fact that the price often will alter a consumer’s purchase decision. The key to optimizing the discount is to predict consumer’s willingness-to-pay (WTP), namely, the highest price a consumer is willing to pay for a product. Purchase data used by traditional e-commerce recommender systems provide points below or above the decision boundary. In this paper we collected training data to better predict the decision boundary. We implement a new e-commerce mechanism adapted from laboratory lottery and auction experiments that elicit a rational customer’s exact WTP for a small subset of products, and use a machine learning algorithm to predict the customer’s WTP for other products. The mechanism is implemented on our own e-commerce website that leverages Amazon’s data and subjects recruited via Mechanical Turk. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can better predict WTP, dramatically improve conversion rate and sales revenue.</p>
