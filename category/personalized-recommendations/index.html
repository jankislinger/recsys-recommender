    <h3>Unleashing the Retrieval Potential of Large Language Models in Conversational Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ting Yang, Li Chen</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to capture user preferences and provide personalized recommendations through interactive natural language interactions. The recent advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized human engagement in natural conversations, driven by their extensive world knowledge and remarkable natural language understanding and generation capabilities. However, introducing LLMs into CRSs presents new technical challenges. Specifically, directly prompting LLMs for recommendation generation requires understanding a large and evolving item corpus, as well as grounding the generated recommendations in the real item space. Moreover, generating recommendations based on external recommendation engines or directly integrating their suggestions into responses may constrain the overall performance of LLMs, since these engines generally have inferior representation abilities compared to LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end large-scale CRS model, ReFICR, a novel LLM-enhanced conversational recommender that empowers a retrievable large language model to perform CRS subtasks by following retrieval and generation instructions through lightweight tuning. By decomposing the complex CRS task into multiple subtasks, we formulate these subtasks into two types of instruction formats: retrieval and generation. The hidden states of ReFICR are utilized as text embeddings to represent user preferences and items for retrieval. Simultaneously, ReFICR is trained to handle generative tasks. We optimize the contrastive objective to enhance text embeddings for retrieval and jointly fine-tune the large language model objective for generation. Our experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that ReFICR significantly outperforms baselines in terms of recommendation accuracy. Our code is publicly available at the link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReFICR-0C3A.</p>

    <h3>Recommending Personalised Targeted Training Adjustments for Marathon Runners (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ciara Feely, Aonghus Lawlor, Barry Smyth, Brian Caulfield</p>
    <p>Preparing for the marathon involves many weeks of dedicated training. Achieving the right balance between building strength and endurance and the need for rest and recovery is a must, if a runner is to arrive at the start-line injury-free and ready to achieve their desired finish-time. However, because most recreational runners rely on generic training plans, they can struggle to find this balance, which can impact their motivation, health, and performance. In this paper, we describe a novel case-based reasoning approach to fine-tuning a runner’s training by recommending training adjustments based on the patterns of similar runners at corresponding points in their marathon training. The approach is designed to target training adjustments that are based on similar runners but with varying race goals,  to allow runners to adjust their training for slower or faster finish-times, as their training progresses and motivations change. We evaluate the recommendations produced using a large-scale real-world dataset according to several factors including, (i) the plausibility of the recommended training adjustment, (ii) the effectiveness of the adjustment when it comes to achieving a particular performance goal, and (iii) the safety of the adjustment in terms of the degree of risk that it will lead to an injury or otherwise disrupt training. Our findings suggest that plausible, effective, and safe recommendations can be generated for runners when evaluated against a range of race goals.</p>

    <h3>Balancing Habit Repetition and New Activity Exploration: A Longitudinal Micro-Randomized Trial in Physical Activity Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ine Coppens, Luc Martens, Toon De Pessemier</p>
    <p>As repetition of activities can establish habits and exploration of new ones can provide a healthy variety, we investigate how a recommender system for physical activities can optimally balance these two approaches. We conducted an eight-week user study with 62 physically inactive participants who receive personalized repetition and exploration recommendations in a random order. We distinguish between location, workout, and general activities, and collect participants’ subjective perceptions. Our findings indicate that participants initially preferred exploring general activities, but rated repeating recommendations higher after two weeks. By exploring the optimal transition point from exploration to repetition in personalized recommendations, this study contributes to designing more effective recommender systems for health improvement and healthy habit formation.</p>

    <h3>Learning Personalized Health Recommendations via Offline Reinforcement Learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Larry Preuett</p>
    <p>The healthcare industry is strained and would benefit from personalized treatment plans for treating various health conditions (e.g., HIV and diabetes). Reinforcement Learning is a promising approach to learning such sequential recommendation systems. However, applying reinforcement learning in the medical domain is challenging due to the lack of adequate evaluation metrics, partial observability, and the inability to explore due to safety concerns. In this line of work, we identify three research directions to improve the applicability of treatment plans learned using offline reinforcement learning.</p>

    <h3>Towards Companion Recommenders Assisting Users’ Long-Term Journeys (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minmin Chen, Konstantina Christakopoulou</p>
    <p>Nowadays, with the abundance of the internet content, users expect the recommendation platforms to not only help them with one-off decisions and short-term tasks, but to also support their persistent and overarching interest journeys, including their real-life goals that last days, months or even years. In order for recommender systems to truly assist users through their real-life journeys, they need to first be able to understand and reason about interests, needs, and goals users want to pursue; and then plan taking those into account. However, the task presents several challenges. In this talk, we will present the key steps and elements needed to tackle the problem — particularly (1) user research for interest journeys; (2) personalized and interpretable user profiles; (3) adapting large language models, and other foundational models, for better user understanding; (4) better planning at a macro-level through reinforcement learning and reason-and-act conversational agents; (5) novel journey-powered front end user experiences, allowing for more user control. We hope that the talk will help inspire other researchers, and will pave the way towards companion recommenders that can truly assist the users throughout their interest journeys.</p>

    <h3>A Probabilistic Position Bias Model for Short-Video Recommendation Feeds (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Jeunen</p>
    <p>Modern web-based platforms often show ranked lists of recommendations to users, in an attempt to maximise user satisfaction or business metrics. Typically, the goal of such systems boils down to maximising the exposure probability — conversely, minimising the rank— for items that are deemed “reward-maximising” according to some metric of interest. This general framing comprises music or movie streaming applications, as well as e-commerce, restaurant or job recommendations, and even web search. Position bias or user models can be used to estimate exposure probabilities for each use-case, specifically tailored to how users interact with the presented rankings. A unifying factor in these diverse problem settings is that typically only one or several items will be engaged with (clicked, streamed, purchased, et cetera) before a user leaves the ranked list.  Short-video feeds on social media platforms diverge from this general framing in several ways, most notably that users do not tend to leave the feed after, for example, liking a post. Indeed, seemingly infinite feeds invite users to scroll further down the ranked list. For this reason, existing position bias or user models tend to fall short in such settings, as they do not accurately capture users’ interaction modalities. In this work, we propose a novel and probabilistically sound personalised position bias model for feed recommendations. We focus on a 1st-level feed in a hierarchical structure, where users may enter a 2nd-level feed via any given 1st-level item. We posit that users come to the platform with a given scrolling budget that is drawn according to a discrete power-law distribution, and show how the survival function of said distribution can be used to obtain closed-form estimates for personalised exposure probabilities. Empirical insights gained through data from a large-scale social media platform show how our probabilistic position bias model more accurately captures empirical exposure than existing models, and paves the way for improved unbiased evaluation and learning-to-rank.</p>

    <h3>Improving Group Recommendations using Personality, Dynamic Clustering and Multi-Agent MicroServices (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> André Martins, Goreti Marreiros, Patrícia Alves, Paulo Novais</p>
    <p>The complexity associated to group recommendations needs strategies to mitigate several problems, such as the group’s heterogeinity and conflicting preferences, the emotional contagion phenomenon, the cold-start problem, and the group members’ needs and concerns while providing recommendations that satisfy all members at once. In this demonstration, we show how we implemented a Multi-Agent Microservice to represent the tourists in a mobile Group Recommender System for Tourism prototype. A novel dynamic clustering process is presented to help minimize the group’s heterogeneity and conflicting preferences. To help solve the cold-start problem, the preliminary tourist attractions preference and travel-related preferences & concerns are predicted using the tourists’ personality, while taking the tourists’ disabilities and fears into account. Although there is no need for previous interactions data to build the tourists’ profile since we predict the tourists’ preferences, the tourist agents learn with each other by using association rules to find patterns in the tourists’ profile and in the ratings given to Points of Interest to refine the recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Optimizing Podcast Discovery: Unveiling Amazon Music’s Retrieval and Ranking Framework (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Greyson, Geetha Aluri, Joaquin Delgado</p>
    <p>This work presents the search architecture of Amazon Music, which is a highly efficient system designed to retrieve relevant content for users. The architecture consists of three key stages: indexing, retrieval, and ranking. During the indexing stage, data is meticulously parsed and processed to create a comprehensive index that contains dense representations and essential information about each document (such as a music or podcast entity) in the collection, including its title, metadata, and relevant attributes. This indexing process enables fast and efficient data access during retrieval. The retrieval stage utilizes multi-faceted retrieval strategies, resulting in improved identification of candidate matches compared to traditional structured search methods. Subsequently, candidates are ranked based on their relevance to the customer’s query, taking into account document features and personalized factors. With a specific focus on the podcast use case, this paper highlights the deployment of the architecture and demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing podcast search capabilities, providing tailored and engaging content experiences.</p>

    <h3>Heterogeneous Knowledge Fusion: A Novel Approach for Personalized Recommendation via LLM (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhichao Feng, Wei Lin, Zixiang Ding, Xiang Li, Bin Yin, Yu Qin, Junjie Xie</p>
    <p>The analysis and mining of user heterogeneous behavior are of paramount importance in recommendation systems. However, the conventional approach of incorporating various types of heterogeneous behavior into recommendation models leads to feature sparsity and knowledge fragmentation issues. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for personalized recommendation via Large Language Model (LLM), by extracting and fusing heterogeneous knowledge from user heterogeneous behavior information. In addition, by combining heterogeneous knowledge and recommendation tasks, instruction tuning is performed on LLM for personalized recommendations. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate user heterogeneous behavior and significantly improve recommendation performance.</p>

    <h3>Going Beyond Local: Global Graph-Enhanced Personalized News Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irene Li, Ruihai Dong, Dairui Liu, Toyotaro Suzumura, Boming Yang</p>
    <p>Precisely recommending candidate news articles to users has always been a core challenge for personalized news recommendation systems. Most recent work primarily focuses on using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract semantic information from rich textual data, employing content-based methods derived from locally viewed historical clicked news. However, this approach lacks a global perspective, failing to account for users’ hidden motivations and behaviors beyond semantic information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model called GLORY(Global-LOcal news Recommendation sYstem), which combines global news representations learned from other users with local news representations to enhance personalized recommendation systems. We accomplish this by constructing a Global Clicked News Encoder, which includes a global news graph and employs gated graph neural networks to fuse news representations, thereby enriching clicked news representations. Similarly, we extend this approach to a Global Candidate News Encoder, utilizing a global entity graph and candidate news fusion to enhance candidate news representation. Evaluation results on two public news datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Furthermore, our model offers more diverse recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Beyond Labels: Leveraging Deep Learning and LLMs for Content Metadata (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaya Kawale, Saurabh Agrawal, John Trenkle</p>
    <p>Content metadata plays a very important role in movie recommender systems as it provides valuable information about various aspects of a movie such as genre, cast, plot synopsis, box office summary, etc. Analyzing the metadata can help understand the user preferences and generate personalized recommendations catering to the niche tastes of the users. It can also help with content cold starting when the recommender system has little or no interaction data available to perform collaborative filtering. In this talk, we will focus on one particular type of metadata – genre labels. Genre labels associated with a movie or a TV series such as “horror” or “comedy” or “romance” help categorize a collection of movies into different themes and correspondingly setting up the audience expectation for a title. We present some of the challenges associated with using genre label information via traditional methods and propose a new way of examining the genre information that we call as the Genre Spectrum. The Genre Spectrum helps capture the various nuanced genres in a title and our offline and online experiments corroborate the effectiveness of the approach.</p>

    <h3>Client Time Series Model: a Multi-Target Recommender System based on Temporally-Masked Encoders (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dirk Sierag, Kevin Zielnicki</p>
    <p>Stitch Fix, an online personal shopping and styling service, creates a personalized shopping experience to meet any purchase occasion across multiple platforms. For example, a client who wants more one-on-one support in shopping for an outfit or look can request a stylist to curate a ‘Fix’, an assortment of 5 items; or they can browse their own personalized shop and make direct purchases in our ‘Freestyle’ experience. We know that personal style changes and evolves over time, so in order to provide the client with the most personalized and dynamic experience across platforms, it is important to recommend items based on our holistic and real-time understanding of their style across all of our platforms. This work introduces the Client Time Series Model (CTSM), a scalable and efficient recommender system based on Temporally-Masked Encoders (TME) that learns one client embedding across all platforms, yet is able to provide distinctive recommendations depending on the platform. An A/B test showed that our model outperformed the baseline model by 5.8% in terms of expected revenue.</p>

    <h3>Unleash the Power of Context: Enhancing Large-Scale Recommender Systems with Context-Based Prediction Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davorin Kopič, Jan Hartman, Assaf Klein, Natalia Silberstein</p>
    <p>In this work, we introduce the notion of Context-Based Prediction Models. A Context-Based Prediction Model determines the probability of a user’s action (such as a click or a conversion) solely by relying on user and contextual features, without considering any specific features of the item itself. We have identified numerous valuable applications for this modeling approach, including training an auxiliary context-based model to estimate click probability and incorporating its prediction as a feature in CTR prediction models.Our experiments indicate that this enhancement brings significant improvements in offline and online business metrics while having minimal impact on the cost of serving. Overall, our work offers a simple and scalable, yet powerful approach for enhancing the performance of large-scale commercial recommender systems, with broad implications for the field of personalized recommendations.</p>
