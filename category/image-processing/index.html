    <h3>A Dataset for Adapting Recommender Systems to the Fashion Rental Economy (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jivitesh Sharma, Karl Audun Borgersen, Morten Goodwin, Morten Grundetjern</p>
    <p>In response to the escalating ecological challenges that threaten global sustainability, there’s a deep need to investigate alternative methods of commerce, such as rental economies. Like most online commerce, rental or otherwise, a functioning recommender system is crucial for their success. Yet the domain has, until this point, been largely neglected by the recommender system research community. Our dataset, derived from our collaboration with the leading Norwegian fashion rental company [Company name omitted for review process], encompasses 64k transactions, rental histories from 2.2k anonymized users, and 15.8k unique outfits in which each physical item’s attributes and rental history is meticulously tracked. All outfits are listed as individual items or their corresponding item groups, referring to shared designs between the individual items. This approach underlines the novel challenges of rental as compared to more traditional recommender system problems where items are generally interchangeable. Each outfit is accompanied by a set of tags describing some of their attributes. We also provide a total of 50k images displaying across all items along with a set of precomputed zero-shot embeddings. We apply a myriad of common recommender system methods to the dataset to provide a performance baseline. This baseline is performed for the traditional fashion recommender system problem of recommending outfit groups and the novel problem of predicting individual item rental. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset discussing the domain of clothes rental. It is our hope that the publication of this dataset will serve as a catalyst for a new branch of research for specialized fashion rental recommender systems. The dataset is temporarily hosted at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/clothes_rental_dataset-B1E8/ and Google Cloud at https: //console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/clothes-rental-dataset The code for collecting, processing, and evaluating the dataset is hosted at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Vibrent_Dataset_Collection-03DC/</p>

    <h3>Reproducibility Analysis of Recommender Systems relying on Visual Features: traps, pitfalls, and countermeasures (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elio Musacchio, Marco Polignano, Antonio Silletti, Pasquale Lops, Giovanni Semeraro, Cataldo Musto</p>
    <p>Reproducibility is an important requirement for scientific progress, and the lack of reproducibility for a large amount of published research can hinder the progress over the state-of-the-art. This concerns several research areas, and recommender systems are witnessing the same reproducibility crisis. Even solid works published at prestigious venues might not be reproducible for several reasons: data might not be public, source code for recommendation algorithms might not be available or well documented, and evaluation metrics might be computed using parameters not explicitly provided. In addition, recommendation pipelines are becoming increasingly complex due to the use of deep neural architectures or representations for multimodal side information involving text, images, audio, or video. This makes the reproducibility of experiments even more challenging. In this work, we describe an extension of an already existing open-source recommendation framework, called ClayRS, with the aim of providing the foundation for future reproducibility of recommendation processes involving images as side information. This extension, called ClayRS Can See, is the starting point for reproducing state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms exploiting images. We have provided our implementation of one of these algorithms, namely VBPR – Visual Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback, and we have discussed all the issues related to the reproducibility of the study to deeply understand the main traps and pitfalls, along with solutions to deal with such complex environments. We conclude the work by proposing a checklist for recommender systems reproducibility as a guide for the research community.</p>

    <h3>Learning Users’ Preferred Visual Styles in an Image Marketplace (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandra Sala, Raul Gomez Bruballa, Lauren Burnham-King</p>
    <p>Providing meaningful recommendations in a content marketplace is challenging due to the fact that users are not the final content consumers. Instead, most users are creatives whose interests, linked to the projects they work on, change rapidly and abruptly. To address the challenging task of recommending images to content creators, we design a RecSys that learns visual styles preferences transversal to the semantics of the projects users work on. We analyze the challenges of the task compared to content-based recommendations driven by semantics, propose an evaluation setup, and explain its applications in a global image marketplace.</p>

    <h3>Semi-Supervised Visual Representation Learning for Fashion Compatibility (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deepthi Sharma, Ambareesh Revanur, Vijay Kumar</p>
    <p>We consider the problem of complementary fashion prediction. Existing approaches focus on learning an embedding space where fashion items from different categories that are visually compatible are closer to each other. However, creating such labeled outfits is intensive and also not feasible to generate all possible outfit combinations, especially with large fashion catalogs. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach where we leverage large unlabeled fashion corpus to create pseudo positive and negative outfits on the fly during training. For each labeled outfit in a training batch, we obtain a pseudo-outfit by matching each item in the labeled outfit with unlabeled items. Additionally, we introduce consistency regularization to ensure that representation of the original images and their transformations are consistent to implicitly incorporate colour and other important attributes through self-supervision. We conduct extensive experiments on Polyvore, Polyvore-D and our newly created large-scale Fashion Outfits datasets, and show that our approach with only a fraction of labeled examples performs on-par with completely supervised methods.</p>

    <h3>ImRec: Learning Reciprocal Preferences Using Images (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan McConville, James Neve</p>
    <p>Reciprocal Recommender Systems are recommender systems for social platforms that connect people to people. They are commonly used in online dating, social networks and recruitment services. The main difference between these and conventional user-item recommenders that might be found on, for example, a shopping service, is that they must consider the interests of both parties. In this study, we present a novel method of making reciprocal recommendations based on image data. Given a user’s history of positive and negative preference expressions on other users images, we train a siamese network to identify images that fit a user’s personal preferences. We provide an algorithm to interpret those individual preference indicators into a single reciprocal preference relation. Our evaluation was performed on a large real-world dataset provided by a popular online dating service. Based on this, our service significantly improves on previous state-of-the-art content-based solutions, and also out-performs collaborative filtering solutions in cold-start situations. The success of this model provides empirical evidence for the high importance of images in online dating.</p>

    <h3>Aesthetic Features for Personalized Photo Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Putra Manggala, Ga Wu, Yu Qing Zhou, Scott Sanner</p>
    <p>Many photography websites such as Flickr, 500px, Unsplash, and Adobe Behance are used by amateur and professional photography enthusiasts. Unlike content-based image search, such users of photography websites are not just looking for photos with certain content, but more generally for photos with a certain photographic “aesthetic”. In this context, we explore personalized photo recommendation and propose two aesthetic feature extraction methods based on (i) color space and (ii) deep style transfer embeddings. Using a dataset from 500px, we evaluate how these features can be best leveraged by collaborative filtering methods and show that (ii) provides a significant boost in photo recommendation performance.</p>

    <h3>Do you have a Pop face? Here is a Pop song. Using profile pictures to mitigate the cold-start problem in Music Recommender Systems. (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugenio Tacchini, Ramon Morros, Enrique Sañoso, Veronica Vilaplana</p>
    <p>When a new user registers to a recommender system service, the system does not know her taste and cannot propose meaningful suggestions (cold-start problem). This preliminary work attempts to mitigate the cold-start problem using the profile picture of the user as a sole information, following the intuition that a correspondence may exist between the pictures that people use to represent themselves and their taste. We proved that, at least in the small music community we used for our experiments, our method can improve the precision of both a classifier and a Top-N music recommender system in a cold-start condition.</p>

    <h3>Image Discovery and Insertion for Custom Publishing (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerry Liu, Shanchan Wu, Lei Liu</p>
    <p>Images in reading materials make the content come alive. Aside from providing additional information to the text, reading material containing illustration engages our spatial memory, increases memory retention of the material. However, despite the plethora of available multimedia, adding illustrations to text continues to be a difficult task for the amateur content publisher. To address this problem, we present a semantic-aware image discovery and insertion system for custom publishing. Compared to image search engines, our system has the advantage of being able to discern among different topics within a long text passage and recommend the most relevant images for each detected topic with semantic “visual words” based relevance.</p>
