    <h3>User Preferences in Recommendation Algorithms: The Influence of User Diversity, Trust, and Product Category on Privacy Perceptions in Recommender Algorithms (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andr√© Calero Valdez, Johannes Nakayama, Martina Ziefle, Nils Plettenberg, Laura Burbach</p>
    <p>The use of recommendation systems is widespread in online commerce. Depending on the algorithm that is used in the recommender system different types of data are recorded from user interactions. Typically better recommendations are achieved when more detailed data about the user and product is available. However, users are often unaware of what data is stored and how it is used in recommendation. In a survey study with 197 participants we introduced different recommendation techniques (collaborative filtering, content-based recommendation, trust-based and social recommendation) to the users and asked participants to rate what type of algorithm should be used for what type of product category (books, mobile phones, contraceptives). We found different patterns of preferences for different product categories. The more sensitive the product the higher the preference for content-based filtering approaches that could work without storing personal data. Trust-based and social approaches utilizing data from social media were generally rejected.</p>

    <h3>Trust based Collaborative Filtering: Tackling the Cold Start Problem Using Regular Equivalence (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomislav Duricic, Emanuel Lacic, Elisabeth Lex, Dominik Kowald</p>
    <p>User-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most popular approaches to create recommender systems. This approach is based on finding the most relevant k users from whose rating history we can extract items to recommend. CF, however, suffers from data sparsity and the cold-start problem since users often rate only a small fraction of available items. One solution is to incorporate additional information into the recommendation process such as explicit trust scores that are assigned by users to others or implicit trust relationships that result from social connections between users. Such relationships typically form a very sparse trust network, which can be utilized to generate recommendations for users based on people they trust. In our work, we explore the use of a measure from network science, i.e. regular equivalence, applied to a trust network to generate a similarity matrix that is used to select the k-nearest neighbors for recommending items. We evaluate our approach on Epinions and we find that we can outperform related methods for tackling cold-start users in terms of recommendation accuracy.</p>
