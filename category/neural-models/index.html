    <h3>Soliciting User Preferences in Conversational Recommender Systems via Usage-related Questions (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivica Kostric, Filip Radlinski, Krisztian Balog</p>
    <p>A key distinguishing feature of conversational recommender systems over traditional recommender systems is their ability to elicit user preferences using natural language. Currently, the predominant approach to preference elicitation is to ask questions directly about items or item attributes. These strategies do not perform well in cases where the user does not have sufficient knowledge of the target domain to answer such questions. Conversely, in a shopping setting, talking about the planned use of items does not present any difficulties, even for those that are new to a domain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to preference elicitation by asking implicit questions based on item usage. Our approach consists of two main steps. First, we identify the sentences from a large review corpus that contain information about item usage. Then, we generate implicit preference elicitation questions from those sentences using a neural text-to-text model. The main contributions of this work also include a multi-stage data annotation protocol using crowdsourcing for collecting high-quality labeled training data for the neural model. We show that out approach is effective in selecting review sentences and transforming them to elicitation questions, even with limited training data.</p>

    <h3>Generation-based vs. Retrieval-based Conversational Recommendation: A User-Centric Comparison (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Ahtsham Manzoor</p>
    <p>In the past few years we observed a renewed interest in conversational recommender systems (CRS) that interact with users in natural language. Most recent research efforts use neural models trained on recorded recommendation dialogs between humans, supporting an end-to-end learning process. Given the userâ€™s utterances in a dialog, these systems aim to generate appropriate responses in natural language based on the learned models. An alternative to such language generation approaches is to retrieve and possibly adapt suitable sentences from the recorded dialogs. Approaches of this latter type are explored only to a lesser extent in the current literature.<br>In this work, we revisit the potential value of retrieval-based approaches to conversational recommendation. To that purpose, we compare two recent deep learning models for response generation with a retrieval-based method that determines a set of response candidates using a nearest-neighbor technique and heuristically reranks them. We adopt a user-centric evaluation approach, where study participants (N=60) rated the responses of the three compared systems. We could reproduce the claimed improvement of one of the deep learning methods over the other. However, the retrieval-based system outperformed both language generation based approaches in terms of the perceived quality of the system responses. Overall, our study suggests that retrieval-based approaches should be considered as an alternative or complement to modern language generation-based approaches.</p>
