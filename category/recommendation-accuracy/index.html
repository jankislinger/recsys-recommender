    <h3>Adaptive Collaborative Filtering with Personalized Time Decay Functions for Financial Product Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baptiste Barreau, Michalis Vazirgiannis, Ashraf Ghiye, Laurent Carlier</p>
    <p>Classical recommender systems often assume that historical data are stationary and fail to account for the dynamic nature of user preferences, limiting their ability to provide reliable recommendations in time-sensitive settings. This assumption is particularly problematic in finance, where financial products exhibit continuous changes in valuations, leading to frequent shifts in client interests. These evolving interests, summarized in the past client-product interactions, see their utility fade over time with a degree that might differ from one client to another. To address this challenge, we propose a time-dependent collaborative filtering algorithm that can adaptively discount distant client-product interactions using personalized decay functions. Our approach is designed to handle the non-stationarity of financial data and produce reliable recommendations by modeling the dynamic collaborative signals between clients and products. We evaluate our method using a proprietary dataset from BNP Paribas and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art benchmarks from relevant literature. Our findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time explicitly in the model to enhance the accuracy of financial product recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Uncovering User Interest from Biased and Noised Watch Time in Video Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Xu, Guohao Cai, Zhenhua Dong, Haiyuan Zhao, Lei Zhang, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
    <p>In micro-video recommendation scenarios, watch time is commonly adopted as an indicator of users’ interest. However, watch time is not only determined by the matching of users’ interests but is affected by other factors. These factors mainly lie in two folds: on the one hand, users tend to spend more time on those charming videos with the growth of the duration (i.e., video length), named as duration bias; on the other hand, it costs people a period of time to judge whether they like the video, named as noisy watching. Consequently, the existence of duration bias and noisy watching make watch time an inadequate label for training a reliable recommendation model. Moreover, current methods focus only on the duration bias and ignore the duration noise, so they do not really uncover the user interest from watch time. In this study, we first analyze the generation mechanism of users’ watch time in a unified causal viewpoint. Unlike current methods, which only notice the duration bias in watch time, we considered the watch time as a mixture of the user’s actual interest, the duration biased watch time, and the noisy watch time. To mitigate both the duration bias and noisy watching, we propose Debiased and Denoised watch time Correction (D$^2$Co), which can be divided into two steps: First, we employ a duration-wise Gaussian Mixture Model plus frequency-weighted moving average for estimating the bias and noise terms; Then we utilize a sensitivity-controlled correction function to separate the user interest from the watch time, which is robust to the estimation error of bias and noise terms. The experiments on two public video recommendation datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

    <h3>Scaling Session-Based Transformer Recommendations using Optimized Negative Sampling and Loss Functions (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Normann, Timo Wilm, Paul-Vincent Kobow, Sophie Baumeister</p>
    <p>This work introduces TRON, a scalable session-based Transformer Recommender using Optimized Negative-sampling. Motivated by the scalability and performance limitations of prevailing models such as SASRec and GRU4Rec+, TRON integrates top-k negative sampling and listwise loss functions to enhance its recommendation accuracy. Evaluations on relevant large-scale e-commerce datasets show that TRON improves upon the recommendation quality of current methods while maintaining training speeds similar to SASRec. A live A/B test yielded an 18.14% increase in click-through rate over SASRec, highlighting the potential of TRON in practical settings. For further research, we provide access to our source code and an anonymized dataset.</p>

    <h3>Towards Recommender Systems with Community Detection and Quantum Computing (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Cremonesi, Riccardo Nembrini, Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema, Costantino Carugno</p>
    <p>After decades of being mainly confined to theoretical research, Quantum Computing is now becoming a useful tool for solving realistic problems. This work aims to experimentally explore the feasibility of using currently available quantum computers, based on the Quantum Annealing paradigm, to build a recommender system exploiting community detection. Community detection, by partitioning users and items into densely connected clusters, can boost the accuracy of non-personalized recommendation by assuming that users within each community share similar tastes. However, community detection is a computationally expensive process. The recent availability of Quantum Annealers as cloud-based devices, constitutes a new and promising direction to explore community detection, although effectively leveraging this new technology is a long-term path that still requires advancements in both hardware and algorithms. This work aims to begin this path by assessing the quality of community detection formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem on a real recommendation scenario. Results on several datasets show that the quantum solver is able to detect communities of comparable quality with respect to classical solvers, but with better speedup, and the non-personalized recommendation models built on top of these communities exhibit improved recommendation quality. The takeaway is that quantum computing, although in its early stages of maturity and applicability, shows promise in its ability to support new recommendation models and to bring improved scalability as technology evolves.</p>

    <h3>BRUCE – Bundle Recommendation Using Contextualized item Embeddings (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Livne, Bracha Shapira, Oren Sar Shalom, Mark Last, Tzoof Avny Brosh</p>
    <p>A bundle is a pre-defined set of items that are collected together. In many domains, bundling is one of the most important marketing strategies for item promotion, commonly used in e-commerce. Bundle recommendation resembles the item recommendation task, where bundles are the recommended unit, but it poses additional challenges; while item recommendation requires only user and item understanding, bundle recommendation also requires modeling the connections between the various items in a bundle. Transformers have driven the state-of-the-art methods for set and sequence modeling in various natural language processing and computer vision tasks, emphasizing the understanding that the neighbors of an element are of crucial importance. Under some required adjustments, we believe the same applies for items in bundles, and better capturing the relations of an item with other items in the bundle may lead to improved recommendations. To address that, we introduce BRUCE - a novel model for bundle recommendation, in which we adapt Transformers to represent data on users, items, and bundles. This allows exploiting the self-attention mechanism to model the following: latent relations between the items in a bundle; and users’ preferences toward each of the items in the bundle and toward the whole bundle. Moreover, we examine various architectures to integrate the items’ and the users’ information and provide insights on architecture selection based on data characteristics. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach contributes to the accuracy of the recommendation and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods</p>

    <h3>Modeling User Repeat Consumption Behavior for Online Novel Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cunxiang Yin, Leeven Luo, Yuncong Li, Yancheng He, Guoqiang Xu, Jing Cai, Sheng-hua Zhong</p>
    <p>Given a user’s historical interaction sequence, online novel recommendation suggests the next novel the user may be interested in. Online novel recommendation is important but underexplored. In this paper, we concentrate on recommending online novels to new users of an online novel reading platform, whose first visits to the platform occurred in the last seven days. We have two observations about online novel recommendation for new users. First, repeat novel consumption of new users is a common phenomenon. Second, interactions between users and novels are informative. To accurately predict whether a user will reconsume a novel, it is crucial to characterize each interaction at a fine-grained level. Based on these two observations, we propose a neural network for online novel recommendation, called NovelNet. NovelNet can recommend the next novel from both the user’s consumed novels and new novels simultaneously. Specifically, an interaction encoder is used to obtain accurate interaction representation considering fine-grained attributes of interaction, and a pointer network with a pointwise loss is incorporated into NovelNet to recommend previously-consumed novels. Moreover, an online novel recommendation dataset is built from a well-known online novel reading platform and is released for public use as a benchmark. Experimental results on the dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of NovelNet 1.</p>

    <h3>Sequence Adaptation via Reinforcement Learning in Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefanos Antaris, Dimitrios Rafailidis</p>
    <p>Accounting for the fact that users have different sequential patterns, the main drawback of state-of-the-art recommendation strategies is that a fixed sequence length of user-item interactions is required as input to train the models. This might limit the recommendation accuracy, as in practice users follow different trends on the sequential recommendations. Hence, baseline strategies might ignore important sequential interactions or add noise to the models with redundant interactions, depending on the variety of users’ sequential behaviours. To overcome this problem, in this study we propose the SAR model, which not only learns the sequential patterns but also adjusts the sequence length of user-item interactions in a personalized manner. We first design an actor-critic framework, where the RL agent tries to compute the optimal sequence length as an action, given the user’s state representation at a certain time step. In addition, we optimize a joint loss function to align the accuracy of the sequential recommendations with the expected cumulative rewards of the critic network, while at the same time we adapt the sequence length with the actor network in a personalized manner. Our experimental evaluation on four real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of our proposed model over several baseline approaches. Finally, we make our implementation publicly available at https://github.com/stefanosantaris/sar.</p>

    <h3>Eigenvalue Perturbation for Item-based Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesare Bernardis, Paolo Cremonesi</p>
    <p>Adding confidence estimates to predicted ratings has been shown to positively influence the quality of the recommendations provided by a recommender system. While confidence over single point predictions of ratings and preferences has been widely studied in literature, limited effort has been put in exploring the benefits provided by user-level confidence indices. In this work we exploit a recently introduced user-level confidence index, called eigenvalue confidence index, in order to provide maximum confidence recommendations for item-based recommender systems. We firstly derive a closed form solution to calculate the index, then we propose a new recommendation methodology for item-based models, called eigenvalue perturbation, founded on the strongly positive correlation between the index value and the accuracy of the recommendations. We show and discuss the accuracy results obtained with a comprehensive set of experiments over several datasets and using different item-based models, empirically proving that applying the new technique we are able to outperform the original recommendation models in most of the experimental configurations.</p>

    <h3>Negative Interactions for Improved Collaborative-Filtering: Don’t go Deeper, go Higher (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harald Steck, Dawen Liang</p>
    <p>The recommendation-accuracy of collaborative filtering approaches is typically improved when taking into account higher-order interactions [5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 16, 18, 24, 25, 28, 31, 34, 36, 41, 42, 44]. While deep nonlinear models are theoretically able to learn higher-order interactions, their capabilities were, however, found to be quite limited in practice [5]. Moreover, the use of low-dimensional embeddings in deep networks may severely limit their expressiveness [8]. This motivated us in this paper to explore a simple extension of linear full-rank models that allow for higher-order interactions as additional explicit input-features. Interestingly, we observed that this model-class obtained by far the best ranking accuracies on the largest data set in our experiments, while it was still competitive with various state-of-the-art deep-learning models on the smaller data sets. Moreover, our approach can also be interpreted as a simple yet effective improvement of the (linear) HOSLIM [11] model: by simply removing the constraint that the learned higher-order interactions have to be non-negative, we observed that the accuracy-gains due to higher-order interactions more than doubled in our experiments. The reason for this large improvement was that large positive higher-order interactions (as used in HOSLIM [11]) are relatively infrequent compared to the number of large negative higher-order interactions in the three well-known data-sets used in our experiments. We further characterize the circumstances where the higher-order interactions provide the most significant improvements.</p>

    <h3>Next-item Recommendations in Short Sessions (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Wang, Shengsheng Wang, Wenzhuo Song, Shoujin Wang</p>
    <p>The changing preferences of users towards items trigger the emergence of session-based recommender systems (SBRSs), which aim to model the dynamic preferences of users for next-item recommendations. However, most of the existing studies on SBRSs are based on long sessions only for recommendations, ignoring short sessions, though short sessions, in fact, account for a large proportion in most of the real-world datasets. As a result, the applicability of existing SBRSs solutions is greatly reduced. In a short session, quite limited contextual information is available, making the next-item recommendation very challenging. To this end, in this paper, inspired by the success of few-shot learning (FSL) in effectively learning a model with limited instances, we formulate the next-item recommendation as an FSL problem. Accordingly, following the basic idea of a representative approach for FSL, i.e., meta-learning, we devise an effective SBRS called INter-SEssion collaborativeRecommender neTwork (INSERT) for next-item recommendations in short sessions. With the carefully devised local module and global module, INSERT is able to learn an optimal preference representation of the current user in a given short session. In particular, in the global module, a similar session retrieval network (SSRN) is designed to find out the sessions similar to the current short session from the historical sessions of both the current user and other users, respectively. The obtained similar sessions are then utilized to complement and optimize the preference representation learned from the current short session by the local module for more accurate next-item recommendations in this short session. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed INSERT over the state-of-the-art SBRSs when making next-item recommendations in short sessions.</p>

    <h3>Product Collection Recommendation in Online Retail (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilias Fountalis, Unaiza Ahsan, Nikolaos Vasiloglou, Nian Yan, Huiming Qu, Khalifeh Al Jadda, Pigi Kouki</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are an integral part of eCommerce services, helping to optimize revenue and user satisfaction. Bundle recommendation has recently gained attention by the research community since behavioral data supports that users often buy more than one product in a single transaction. In most cases, bundle recommendations are of the form “users who bought product A also bought products B, C, and D”. Although such recommendations can be useful, there is no guarantee that  products A, B, C, and D may actually be related to each other.  In this paper, we address the problem of collection recommendation, i.e., recommending a collection of products that share a common theme and can potentially be purchased together in a single transaction.  We extend on traditional approaches that use mostly transactional data by incorporating both domain knowledge from product suppliers in the form of hierarchies, as well as textual  attributes from the products.  Our approach starts by combining product hierarchies together with transactional data or domain knowledge to identify candidate sets of product collections. Then, it generates the product collection recommendations from these candidate sets by learning a deep similarity model that leverages textual attributes. Experimental evaluation on real data from the Home Depot online retailer shows that the proposed solution can recommend collections of products with  increased accuracy when compared to expert-crafted collections. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Attribute-Aware Non-Linear Co-Embeddings of Graph Features (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Rashed, Lars Schmidt-Thieme, Josif Grabocka</p>
    <p>In very sparse recommender data sets, attributes of users such as age, gender and home location and attributes of items such as, in the case of movies, genre, release year, and director can improve the recommendation accuracy, especially for users and items that have few ratings. While most recommendation models can be extended to take attributes of users and items into account, their architectures usually become more complicated. While attributes for items are often easy to be provided, attributes for users are often scarce for reasons of privacy or simply because they are not relevant to the operational process at hand. In this paper, we address these two problems for attribute-aware recommender systems by proposing a simple model that co-embeds users and items into a joint latent space in a similar way as a vanilla matrix factorization, but with non-linear latent features construction that seamlessly can ingest user or item attributes or both (GraphRec). To address the second problem, scarce attributes, the proposed model treats the user-item relation as a bipartite graph and constructs generic user and item attributes via the Laplacian of the user-item co-occurrence graph that requires no further external side information but the mere rating matrix. In experiments on three recommender datasets, we show that GraphRec significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art attribute-aware and content-aware recommender systems even without using any side information.</p>

    <h3>Users in the Loop: A Psychologically-Informed Approach to Similar Item Retrieval (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amy A. Winecoff, Matthew Graham, Florin Brasoveanu, Pearce Washabaugh, Bryce Casavant</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RS) often leverage information about the similarity between items’ features to make recommendations. Yet, many commonly used similarity functions make mathematical assumptions such as symmetry (i.e., Sim(a,b) = Sim(b,a)) that are inconsistent with how humans make similarity judgments. Moreover, most algorithm validations either do not directly measure users’ behavior or fail to comply with methodological standards for psychological research. RS that are developed and evaluated without regard to users’ psychology may fail to meet users’ needs. To provide recommendations that do meet the needs of users, we must: 1) develop similarity functions that account for known properties of human cognition, and 2) rigorously evaluate the performance of these functions using methodologically sound user testing. Here, we develop a framework for evaluating users’ judgments of similarity that is informed by best practices in psychological research methods. Employing users’ fashion item similarity judgments collected using our framework, we demonstrate that a psychologically-informed similarity function (i.e., Tversky contrast model) outperforms a psychologically-naive similarity function (i.e., Jaccard similarity) in predicting users’ similarity judgments.</p>

    <h3>A Simple Multi-Armed Nearest-Neighbor Bandit for Interactive Recommendation (2019)</h3>

    <p>The cyclic nature of the recommendation task is being increasingly taken into account in recommender systems research. In this line, framing interactive recommendation as a genuine reinforcement learning problem, multi-armed bandit approaches have been increasingly considered as a means to cope with the dual exploitation/exploration goal of recommendation. In this paper we develop a simple multi-armed bandit elaboration of neighbor-based collaborative filtering. The approach can be seen as a variant of the nearest-neighbors scheme, but endowed with a controlled stochastic exploration capability of the users’ neighborhood, by a parameter-free application of Thompson sampling. Our approach is based on a formal development and a reasonably simple design, whereby it aims to be easy to reproduce and further elaborate upon. We report experiments using datasets from different domains showing that neighbor-based bandits indeed achieve recommendation accuracy enhancements in the mid to long run. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>A Hierarchical Bayesian Model for Size Recommendation in Fashion (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuen King Ho, Abdul-Saboor Sheikh, Evgenyi Koryagin, Reza Shirvany, Urs Bergmann, Romain Guigourès</p>
    <p>We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian approach to tackle the challenging problem of size recommendation in e-commerce fashion. Our approach jointly models a size purchased by a customer, and its possible return event: 1. no return, 2. returned too small 3. returned too big. Those events are drawn following a multinomial distribution parameterized on the joint probability of each event, built following a hierarchy combining priors. Such a model allows us to incorporate extended domain expertise and article characteristics as prior knowledge, which in turn makes it possible for the underlying parameters to emerge thanks to sufficient data. Experiments are presented on real (anonymized) data from millions of customers along with a detailed discussion on the efficiency of such an approach within a large scale production system.</p>
