    <h3>A Pre-trained Zero-shot Sequential Recommendation Framework via Popularity Dynamics (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hari Sundaram, Junting Wang, Praneet Rathi</p>
    <p>This paper proposes a novel pre-trained framework for zero-shot cross-domain  sequential recommendation without auxiliary information. While using auxiliary information (e.g., item descriptions) seems promising for cross-domain transfer, a cross-domain adaptation of sequential recommenders can be challenging when the target domain differs from the source domain—item descriptions are in different languages; metadata modalities (e.g., audio, image, and text) differ across source and target domains. If we can learn universal item representations independent of the domain type (e.g., groceries, movies), we can achieve zero-shot cross-domain transfer without auxiliary information. Our critical insight is that user interaction sequences highlight shifting user preferences via the popularity dynamics of interacted items. We present a pre-trained sequential recommendation framework: PrepRec, which utilizes a novel popularity dynamics-aware transformer architecture. Through extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, we show that PrepRec, without any auxiliary information, can zero-shot adapt to new application domains and achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art sequential recommender models. In addition, we show that PrepRec complements existing sequential recommenders. With a simple post-hoc interpolation, PrepRec improves the performance of existing sequential recommenders on average by 11.8% in Recall@10 and 22% in NDCG@10. We provide an anonymized implementation of PrepRec at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PrepRec–128E/}.</p>

    <h3>Multi-task Item-attribute Graph Pre-training for Strict Cold-start Item Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Peng, Zhiwei Liu, Chenyu You, Philip Yu, Liangwei Yang, Chen Wang, Yuwei Cao</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems suffer in the strict cold-start (SCS) scenario, where the user-item interactions are entirely unavailable. The well-established, dominating identity (ID)-based approaches completely fail to work. Cold-start recommenders, on the other hand, leverage item contents (brand, title, descriptions, etc.) to map the new items to the existing ones. However, the existing SCS recommenders explore item contents in coarse-grained manners that introduce noise or information loss. Moreover, informative data sources other than item contents, such as users’ purchase sequences and review texts, are largely ignored. In this work, we explore the role of the fine-grained item attributes in bridging the gaps between the existing and the SCS items and pre-train a knowledgeable item-attribute graph for SCS item recommendation. Our proposed framework, ColdGPT, models item-attribute correlations into an item-attribute graph by extracting fine-grained attributes from item contents. ColdGPT then transfers knowledge into the item-attribute graph from various available data sources, i.e., item contents, historical purchase sequences, and review texts of the existing items, via multi-task learning. To facilitate the positive transfer, ColdGPT designs specific submodules according to the natural forms of the data sources and proposes to coordinate the multiple pre-training tasks via unified alignment-and-uniformity losses. Our pre-trained item-attribute graph acts as an implicit, extendable item embedding matrix, which enables the SCS item embeddings to be easily acquired by inserting these items into the item-attribute graph and propagating their attributes’ embeddings. We carefully process three public datasets, i.e., Yelp, Amazon-home, and Amazon-sports, to guarantee the SCS setting for evaluation. Extensive experiments show that ColdGPT consistently outperforms the existing SCS recommenders by large margins and even surpasses models that are pre-trained on 75 – 224 times more, cross-domain data on two out of four datasets. Our code and pre-processed datasets for SCS evaluations are publicly available to help future SCS studies.</p>

    <h3>BETA-Rec: Build, Evaluate and Tune Automated Recommender Systems (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iadh Ounis, Yaxiong Wu, Shangsong Liang, Zaiqiao Meng, Craig Macdonald, Guangtao Zeng, Richard McCreadie, Siwei Liu, Yucheng Liang, Qiang Zhang, Junhua Liang</p>
    <p>The field of recommender systems has rapidly evolved over the last few years, with significant advances made due to the in-flux of deep learning techniques. However, as a result of this rapid progress, escalating barriers-to-entry for new researchers is emerging. In particular, state-of-the-art approaches have fragmented into a large number of code-bases, often requiring different input formats, pre-processing stages and evaluating with different metric packages. Hence, it is time-consuming for new researchers to reach the point of having both an effective baseline set and a sound comparative environment. As a step towards elevating this problem, we have developed BETA-Rec, an open source project for Building, Evaluating and Tuning Automated Recommender Systems. BETA-Rec aims to provide a practical data toolkit for building end-to-end recommendation systems in a standardized way. It provides means for dataset preparation and splitting using common strategies, a generalized model engine for implementing recommender models using Pytorch with 9 models available out-of-the-box, as well as a unified training, validation, tuning and testing pipeline. Furthermore, BETA-Rec is designed to be both modular and extensible, enabling new models to be quickly added to the framework. It is deployable in a wide range of environments via pre-built docker containers and supports distributed parameter tuning using Ray. In this demo, we will illustrate the deployment and use of BETA-Rec for researchers and practitioners on a number of standard recommendation datasets. The source code of the project is available at github: https://github.com/beta-team/beta-recsys.</p>
