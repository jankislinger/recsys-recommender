    <h3>Supporting Knowledge Workers through Personal Information Assistance with Context-aware Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahta Bakhshizadeh</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are extensively employed across various domains to mitigate information overload by providing personalized content. Despite their widespread use in sectors such as streaming, social networks, and e-commerce, utilizing them for personal information assistance is a comparatively novel application. This emerging application aims to develop intelligent systems capable of proactively providing knowledge workers with the most relevant information based on their context to enhance productivity. In this paper, we explore this innovative application by first defining the scope of our study, outlining the key objectives, and introducing main challenges. We then present our current results and progress, including a comprehensive literature review, the proposal of a framework, the collection of a pioneering dataset, and the establishment of a benchmark for evaluating a recommendation scenario on our published dataset. We also discuss our ongoing efforts and future research directions.</p>

    <h3>Towards a Taxonomy of User Feedback Intents for Conversational Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Chen, Wanling Cai</p>
    <p>Understanding users’ feedback on recommendation in natural language is crucially important for assisting the system to refine its understanding of the user’s preferences and provide more accurate recommendations in the subsequent interactions. In this paper, we report the results of an exploratory study on a human-human dialogue dataset centered around movie recommendations. In particular, we manually labeled a set of over 200 dialogues at the utterance level, and then conducted descriptive analysis on them from both seekers’ and recommenders’ perspectives. The results reveal not only seekers’ feedback intents as well as the types of preferences they have expressed, but also the reactions of human recommenders that have finally led to successful recommendation. A taxonomy for feedback intents is established along with the results, which could be constructive for improving conversational recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Early Lessons from a Voice-Only Interface for Finding Movies (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua Wissbroecker, F. Maxwell Harper</p>
    <p>The current generation of streaming media players often allow users to speak commands (e.g., users can change the TV channel by pressing a button and saying “ESPN”). However, these devices typically support a narrow range of control- and search-oriented commands, and do not support deeper recommendation or exploration queries. To study spoken natural language interactions with recommenders, we have built MovieLens TV, a movie recommender system with no input modalities except voice. In this poster, we describe MovieLens TV, with a focus on lessons learned building a prototype system around an off-the-shelf Amazon Echo.</p>

    <h3>Voting Operations for a Group Recommender System in a Distributed User Interface Environment. (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Part Saelim, Wolfgang Wörndl</p>
    <p>This work investigates distributed user interfaces for group recommender systems. In our scenario of a movie recommender, the user interface is distributed on two platforms: personal mobile devices and a public multi-touch tabletop. Our solution proposes voting operations to better support the consensus building among group members. We have implemented a prototype and conducted a preliminary user study with interesting results.</p>

    <h3>Interactive Food Recommendation for Groups (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehdi Elahi, Mouzhi Ge, Massimo David, Shlomo Berkovsky, Francesco Ricci</p>
    <p>We present a prototype of a novel interactive food recommender for groups of users that supports groups in planning their meals through a conversational process based on critiquing. The system comprises two novel elements: a user interface and interaction design based on tagging and critiquing, and a utility function incorporating healthiness and diet compliance factors.</p>
