    <h3>Reproducibility Analysis of Recommender Systems relying on Visual Features: traps, pitfalls, and countermeasures (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elio Musacchio, Marco Polignano, Antonio Silletti, Pasquale Lops, Giovanni Semeraro, Cataldo Musto</p>
    <p>Reproducibility is an important requirement for scientific progress, and the lack of reproducibility for a large amount of published research can hinder the progress over the state-of-the-art. This concerns several research areas, and recommender systems are witnessing the same reproducibility crisis. Even solid works published at prestigious venues might not be reproducible for several reasons: data might not be public, source code for recommendation algorithms might not be available or well documented, and evaluation metrics might be computed using parameters not explicitly provided. In addition, recommendation pipelines are becoming increasingly complex due to the use of deep neural architectures or representations for multimodal side information involving text, images, audio, or video. This makes the reproducibility of experiments even more challenging. In this work, we describe an extension of an already existing open-source recommendation framework, called ClayRS, with the aim of providing the foundation for future reproducibility of recommendation processes involving images as side information. This extension, called ClayRS Can See, is the starting point for reproducing state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms exploiting images. We have provided our implementation of one of these algorithms, namely VBPR – Visual Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback, and we have discussed all the issues related to the reproducibility of the study to deeply understand the main traps and pitfalls, along with solutions to deal with such complex environments. We conclude the work by proposing a checklist for recommender systems reproducibility as a guide for the research community.</p>

    <h3>Field-aware Factorization Machines for CTR Prediction (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchin Juan, Wei-Sheng Chin, Yong Zhuang, Chih-Jen Lin</p>
    <p>Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in computational advertising. Models based on degree-2 polynomial mappings and factorization machines (FMs) are widely used for this task. Recently, a variant of FMs, field-aware factorization machines (FFMs), outperforms existing models in some world-wide CTR-prediction competitions. Based on our experiences in winning two of them, in this paper we establish FFMs as an effective method for classifying large sparse data including those from CTR prediction. First, we propose efficient implementations for training FFMs. Then we comprehensively analyze FFMs and compare this approach with competing models. Experiments show that FFMs are very useful for certain classification problems. Finally, we have released a package of FFMs for public use.</p>

    <h3>Past, Present, and Future of Recommender Systems: An Industry Perspective (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Justin Basilico, Xavier Amatriain</p>
    <p>When the Netflix Prize launched in 2006, it put a spotlight on the importance and use of recommender systems in real-world applications. The competition provided many lessons, and many more have been learned since the Grand Prize was awarded in 2009. The use of recommender systems in industry has continued to grow driven by the availability of many kinds of user data and the continued interest for the area within the research community. In this paper, we will describe what we see as the past, present, and future of recommender systems from an industry perspective.</p>

    <h3>Voting Operations for a Group Recommender System in a Distributed User Interface Environment. (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Part Saelim, Wolfgang Wörndl</p>
    <p>This work investigates distributed user interfaces for group recommender systems. In our scenario of a movie recommender, the user interface is distributed on two platforms: personal mobile devices and a public multi-touch tabletop. Our solution proposes voting operations to better support the consensus building among group members. We have implemented a prototype and conducted a preliminary user study with interesting results.</p>
