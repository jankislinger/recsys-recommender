    <h3>Dual Attentional Higher Order Factorization Machines (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prakash Mandayam Comar, Dipankar Das, Vivek Sembium, Arindam Sarkar</p>
    <p>Numerous problems of practical significance such as clickthrough rate (CTR) prediction, forecasting, tagging and so on, involve complex interaction of various user, item and context features. Manual feature engineering has been used in the past to model these combinatorial features but it requires domain expertise and becomes prohibitively expensive as the number of features increases. Feedforward neural networks alleviate the need for manual feature engineering to a large extent and have shown impressive performance across multiple domains due to their ability to learn arbitrary functions. Despite multiple layers of non-linear projections, neural networks are limited in their ability to efficiently model functions with higher order interaction terms. In recent years, Factorization Machines and its variants have been proposed to explicitly capture higher order combinatorial interactions. However not all feature interactions are equally important, and in sparse data settings, without a suitable suppression mechanism, this might result into noisy terms during inference and hurt model generalization. In this work we present Dual Attentional Higher Order Factorization Machine (DA-HoFM), a unified attentional higher order factorization machine which leverages a compositional architecture to compute higher order terms with complexity linear in terms of maximum interaction degree. Equipped with sparse dual attention mechanism, DA-HoFM summarizes interaction terms at each layer, and is able to efficiently select important higher order terms. We empirically demonstrate effectiveness of our proposed models on the task of CTR prediction, where our model exhibits superior performance compared to the recent state-of-the-art models, outperforming them by up to 6.7% on the logloss metric.</p>

    <h3>Recommending for a Multi-Sided Marketplace with Heterogeneous Contents (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian Xing Zhang, Yuyan Wang, Long Tao</p>
    <p>Many online personalization platforms today are recommending heterogeneous contents in a multi-sided marketplace consisting of consumers, merchants and other partners. For a recommender system to be successful in these contexts, it faces two main challenges. First, each side in the marketplace has different and potentially conflicting utilities. Recommending for a multi-sided marketplace therefore entails jointly optimizing multiple objectives with trade-offs. Second, the off-the-shelf recommendation algorithms are not applicable to the heterogeneous content space, where a recommendation item could be an aggregation of other recommendation items. In this work, we develop a general framework for recommender systems in a multi-sided marketplace with heterogeneous and hierarchical contents. We propose a constrained optimization framework with machine learning models for each objective as inputs, and a probabilistic structural model for users’ engagement patterns on heterogeneous contents. Our proposed structural modeling approach ensures consistent user experience across different levels of aggregation of the contents, and provides levels of transparency to the merchants and content providers. We further develop an efficient optimization solution for ranking and recommendation in large-scale online systems in real time. We implement the framework at Uber Eats, one of the largest online food delivery platforms in the world and a three-sided marketplace consisting of eaters, restaurant partners and delivery partners. Online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in ranking heterogeneous contents and optimizing for the three sides in the marketplace. Our framework has been deployed globally as the recommendation algorithm for Uber Eats’ homepage.</p>

    <h3>Jointly Optimize Capacity, Latency and Engagement in Large-scale Recommendation Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hitesh Khandelwal</p>
    <p>As the recommendation systems behind commercial services scale up and apply more and more sophisticated machine learning models, it becomes important to optimize computational cost (capacity) and runtime latency, besides the traditional objective of user engagement. Caching recommended results and reusing them later is a common technique used to reduce capacity and latency. However, the standard caching approach negatively impacts user engagement. To overcome the challenge, this paper presents an approach to optimizing capacity, latency and engagement simultaneously. We propose a smart caching system including a lightweight adjuster model to refresh the cached ranking scores, achieving significant capacity savings without impacting ranking quality. To further optimize latency, we introduce a prefetching strategy which leverages the smart cache. Our production deployment on Facebook Marketplace demonstrates that the approach reduces capacity demand by 50% and p75 end-to-end latency by 35%. While Facebook Marketplace is used as a case study, the approach is applicable to other industrial recommendation systems as well.</p>

    <h3>Elsevier, Fairness in Recommendations (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Kershaw</p>
    <p>At Elsevier we aim to help scientists further their research. On the one hand, by offering a platform for publishing ground-breaking research, and on the other by helping researchers discover relevant content to assist their work. In our team, Editorial Data Science, we support the former goal by providing tools to help editors in the decisions that they make, from finding reviewers to recommending transfers for manuscripts to more appropriate journals. To improve the workflows for publishing research and help editors in finding relevant reviewers we developed a reviewer recommender. The reviewer recommender will, based on a submitted manuscript, recommend reviewers that optimise the fit between the manuscript, the journal, and the reviewer themselves. To achieve this, the reviewer recommender is built on top of the three principles of quality data, expert knowledge, and experimentation. We leverage data from across Elsevier, ranging from Scopus profiles which includes publication histories and academic impact data, to data from our publishing platform which includes historic invites and subsequent actions around submitted manuscripts. All this data is used to develop and evaluate appropriate models for recommending reviewers. There are many factors to consider when deciding if someone is relevant to review a submitted manuscript. To name a few, the topic of interest of the reviewer, level of expertise of the reviewer, fit of the reviewer to the journal. But we are ultimately looking for the fit between the three stake holders: the manuscript, the journal, and the reviewer. However, it is not as simple as looking for a fit purely on topic or relevance. We can find evidence for that in the growth of research into recommender systems for multi-sided market [ 7] places where all sides within the systems must be considered. In our case, in addition to topical fit, we must consider fairness in recommendations, where minority groups get equal and fair treatment. For this reason, we consider two ’additional’ constraints when developing recommender systems at Elsevier, fairness in the recommendations and respecting the reviewers time and privacy. Fairness in Recommendations is important in recommending people particular within academic fields where there are known biases against minority groups. This bias is present in data which we use. [REF] showed that women and minorities over their academic and research careers are disadvantaged compared to members of the majority groups, either through less research output due to more teaching [ 6] or taking time out to raise families which resulted in lower number of research output [8]. Though bias is not only limited to quantities of research output [ 4 ] showed that women receive fewer citations even when controlling to quantity of research output and gender. This effect of receiving proportionally fewer citation is also amplified [ 5] identified that women are disproportionally ranked lower on the author list of a paper. These observations are not limited to gender but also race and age. Using these features derived from bibliometric analysis without due care within a model could lead to adverse impact against minority groups, resulting in the reviewers from these groups being recommended less and thus less invites to review manuscripts, whilst making sure any interventions does not create additional harms. Respecting user privacy and time. We know through user research that there is also the need to respect the researcher whom we are asking to review these manuscripts. Either because they are too busy to accept another review, or that they feel the manuscript is out of their scope and they are invited to review irrelevant papers. In this talk we show how at Elsevier we build fairness and understanding of stake holders into our recommenders, particularly the reviewer recommender. We experimented with a variety of technologies, ranging from simple search to sophisticated ML models. They all follow the common IR approach of candidate selection followed by re-ranking. All approaches use roughly the same features representing the reviewer (topics they have published in), the journal (topics the journal publishes and metrics about the reviewers they have selected before), the manuscript (key concepts within the manuscript). Through iterating over different models and techniques, we understand the importance of different features, along with their impact on model performance. But more specifically which features have inherent bias built into them, which feature are most predictive , and which fairness aware methods have been used to mitigate these biases [1, 2]. We will then discuss the methods and challenges of including bias metrics in the evaluation and development of the reviewer recommender. In this we focus on how we evaluate fairness from historical data along with group-wise fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equal opportunity. We then discuss the challenges and successes of monitoring these metrics in production [3]. This combination of feature understanding and fairness evaluation at every stage in the model development means we have a deep understanding of how the model works, who it impacts, and how. Resulting in a fair model which keeps the reviewers at the heart of the review process. However, we must not forget, this work sits within the wider academic review system, where bias is introduced on many levels through hiring, promotions and research engagement. Even though a reviewer recommender can not correct the underlying bias, it can contribute to a fairer and more equal outcome.</p>

    <h3>Smart Targeting: A Relevance-driven and Configurable Targeting Framework for Advertising System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yafei Yao, Changping Peng, Weipeng Yan, Kui Ma, Yongjun Bao, Zhiwei Fang, Yong Li, Zihao Zhao</p>
    <p>Targeting system is an essential part of computational advertising. It allows advertisers to select and reach their targeted users. Due to various advertising goals and the demand for making budget plans, advertisers have a strong will to configure the final targeting results, or they can become very cautious in spending money on advertising campaigns. Meanwhile, to guarantee the advertising performance, the targeted users should also be relevant to the ads of the advertisers. Recent targeting methods are mainly based on tags produced by the Data Management Platform (DMP) which is easy for the advertisers to configure the targeting results. However, in such methods, the relevance between the targeted users and ads is not technically evaluated and cannot be guaranteed. The biggest challenge is that it is hard for a machine learning model to both model the relevance and take account of the advertiser’s configuration demands. In this paper, we propose a novel relevance-driven and configurable targeting framework called Smart Targeting to solve the problem. Specifically, different from Tag-wise Targeting, we first use a relevance model to retrieve the most relevant users for the ads. To further enable the advertisers to configure the final results, we develop a Delay Intervention Mechanism to leverage the power of DMP. As far as we know, this is the first attempt of combining relevance modeling and advertiser intervention into a unified targeting system. We implement and evaluate our framework on JD.com platform with over 300 million users and the results show that it can bring significant improvements to the core indicators such as CTR and eCPM. The long term monitoring also demonstrates that Smart Targeting gradually becomes the most popular targeting tool after its release.</p>

    <h3>Optimizing Similar Item Recommendations in a Semi-structured Marketplace to Maximize Conversion (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marie Jacob, Natraj Srinivasan, Stephen Neola, Paul Wang, Ryan Snyder, Yuri M Brovman, Daniel Galron</p>
    <p>This paper tackles the problem of recommendations in eBay’s large semi-structured marketplace. eBay’s variable inventory and lack of structured information about listings makes traditional collaborative filtering algorithms difficult to use. We discuss how to overcome these data limitations to produce high quality recommendations in real time with a combination of a customized scalable architecture as well as a widely applicable machine learned ranking model. A pointwise ranking approach is utilized to reduce the ranking problem to a binary classification problem optimized on past user purchase behavior. We present details of a sampling strategy and feature engineering that have been critical to achieve a lift in both purchase through rate (PTR) and revenue.</p>

    <h3>Learning to Measure Quality of Queries for Automatic Query Suggestion (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian Chen, Hyoseop Shin</p>
    <p>Users tend to use their own terms to search items in structured search systems such as restaurant searches (e.g. Yelp), but due to users’ lack of understanding on internal vocabulary and structures, they often fail to adequately search, which leads to unsatisfying search results. In this case, search systems should assist users to use different terms for better search results. To address this issue, we develop a scheme to generate suggested queries, given a user query. At first in doing this, in this paper we propose a scheme to evaluate queries (i.e. user queries and/or suggested queries) based on two measures: 1) if the query will return a sufficient number of search results, 2) if the query will return search results of high quality. Furthermore, we present a learning model to choose among alternative candidate queries against a user query. Our experiments show the proposed method is feasible and scalable.</p>
