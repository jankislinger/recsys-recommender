    <h3>Rethinking Multi-Interest Learning for Candidate Matching in Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peilin Zhou, Fangzhao Wu, Jingqi Gao, Jae Boum Kim, Yueqi Xie, Yining Hua, Sunghun Kim, Qichen Ye</p>
    <p>Existing research efforts for multi-interest candidate matching in recommender systems mainly focus on improving model architecture or incorporating additional information, neglecting the importance of training schemes. This work revisits the training framework and uncovers two major problems hindering the expressiveness of learned multi-interest representations. First, the current training objective (i.e., uniformly sampled softmax) fails to effectively train discriminative representations in a multi-interest learning scenario due to the severe increase in easy negative samples. Second, a routing collapse problem is observed where each learned interest may collapse to express information only from a single item, resulting in information loss. To address these issues, we propose the REMI framework, consisting of an Interest-aware Hard Negative mining strategy (IHN) and a Routing Regularization (RR) method. IHN emphasizes interest-aware hard negatives by proposing an ideal sampling distribution and developing a Monte-Carlo strategy for efficient approximation. RR prevents routing collapse by introducing a novel regularization term on the item-to-interest routing matrices. These two components enhance the learned multi-interest representations from both the optimization objective and the composition information. REMI is a general framework that can be readily applied to various existing multi-interest candidate matching methods. Experiments on three real-world datasets show our method can significantly improve state-of-the-art methods with easy implementation and negligible computational overhead.

    <h3>Exploiting Negative Preference in Content-based Music Recommendation with Contrastive Learning (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minju Park, Kyogu Lee</p>
    <p>Advanced music recommendation systems are being introduced along with the development of machine learning. However, it is essential to design a music recommendation system that can increase user satisfaction by understanding users’ music tastes, not by the complexity of models. Although several studies related to music recommendation systems exploiting negative preferences have shown performance improvements, there was a lack of explanation on how they led to better recommendations. In this work, we analyze the role of negative preference in users’ music tastes by comparing music recommendation models with contrastive learning exploiting preference (CLEP) but with three different training strategies - exploiting preferences of both positive and negative (CLEP-PN), positive only (CLEP-P), and negative only (CLEP-N). We evaluate the effectiveness of the negative preference by validating each system with a small amount of personalized data obtained via survey and further illuminate the possibility of exploiting negative preference in music recommendations. Our experimental results show that CLEP-N outperforms the other two in accuracy and false positive rate. Furthermore, the proposed training strategies produced a consistent tendency regardless of different types of front-end musical feature extractors, proving the stability of the proposed method.</p>

    <h3>Parallel Recurrent Neural Network Architectures for Feature-rich Session-based Recommendations (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Domonkos Tikk, Balázs Hidasi, Massimo Quadrana, Alexandros Karatzoglou</p>
    <p>Real-life recommender systems often face the daunting task of providing recommendations based only on the clicks of a user session. Methods that rely on user profiles — such as matrix factorization — perform very poorly in this setting, thus item-to-item recommendations are used most of the time. However the items typically have rich feature representations such as pictures and text descriptions that can be used to model the sessions. Here we investigate how these features can be exploited in Recurrent Neural Network based session models using deep learning. We show that obvious approaches do not leverage these data sources. We thus introduce a number of parallel RNN (p-RNN) architectures to model sessions based on the clicks and the features (images and text) of the clicked items. We also propose alternative training strategies for p-RNNs that suit them better than standard training. We show that p-RNN architectures with proper training have significant performance improvements over feature-less session models while all session-based models outperform the item-to-item type baseline.</p>
