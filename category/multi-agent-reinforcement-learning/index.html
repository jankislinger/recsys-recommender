    <h3>Learning to Collaborate in Multi-Module Recommendation via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning without Communication (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haikai Chen, Bo An, Rundong Wang, Xu He, Yanghua Li, Runsheng Yu, Zhirong Wang, Xin Li, Xinrun Wang</p>
    <p>With the rise of online e-commerce platforms, more and more customers prefer to shop online. To sell more products, online platforms introduce various modules to recommend items with different properties such as huge discounts. A web page often consists of different independent modules. The ranking policies of these modules are decided by different teams and optimized individually without cooperation, which might result in competition between modules. Thus, the global policy of the whole page could be sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent cooperative reinforcement learning approach with the restriction that different modules cannot communicate. Our contributions are three-fold. Firstly, inspired by a solution concept in game theory named correlated equilibrium, we design a signal network to promote cooperation of all modules by generating signals (vectors) for different modules. Secondly, an entropy-regularized version of the signal network is proposed to coordinate agentsâ€™ exploration of the optimal global policy. Furthermore, experiments based on real-world e-commerce data demonstrate that our algorithm obtains superior performance over baselines.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Scholarly Collaborator Recommendation via Competitive Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Zhang, Xiaozhong Liu, Chenwei Zhang</p>
    <p>In an interdisciplinary environment, scientific collaboration is becoming increasingly important. Helping scholars make a right choice of potential collaborators is essential in achieving scientific success. Intuitively, the generation of collaboration relationship is a dynamic process. For instance, one scholar may first choose to work with Scholar A, and then work with Scholar B after accumulating additional academic credits. To address this property, we propose a novel dynamic collaboration recommendation method by adapting the multi-agent reinforcement learning technique to the coauthor network analysis. The collaborator selection is optimized from several different scholar similarity measurements. Unlike prior studies, the proposed method characterizes scholarly competition, a.k.a. different scholars will compete for potential collaborator at each iteration. An evaluation with the ACM data shows that multi-agent reinforcement learning plus scholarly competition modeling can be significant for collaboration recommendation.</p>
