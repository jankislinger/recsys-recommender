    <h3>You Do Not Need a Bigger Boat: Recommendations at Reasonable Scale in a (Mostly) Serverless and Open Stack. (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacopo Tagliabue</p>
    <p>We argue that immature data pipelines are preventing a large portion of industry practitioners from leveraging the latest research on recommender systems. We propose our template data stack for machine learning at “reasonable scale”, and show how many challenges are solved by embracing a serverless paradigm. Leveraging our experience, we detail how modern open source tools can provide a pipeline processing terabytes of data with minimal infrastructure work.</p>

    <h3>Query-Based Simple and Scalable Recommender Systems with Apache Hivemall (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Makoto Yui, Takuya Kitazawa</p>
    <p>This study demonstrates a way to build large-scale recommender systems by just writing a series of SQL-like queries. In order to efficiently run recommendation logics on a cluster of computers, we implemented a variety of recommendation algorithms and common recommendation functions (e.g., efficient similarity computation, top-k retrieval, and evaluation measures) asHive user-defined functions (UDFs) in Apache Hivemall. We demonstrate that how Apache Hivemall can easily be used for building a scalable recommendation system with satisfying business requirements such as scalability, latency, and stability.</p>

    <h3>A Scalable Approach for Periodical Personalized Recommendations (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ish Rishabh, John Carnahan, Zhen Qin</p>
    <p>We develop a highly scalable and effective contextual bandit approach towards periodical personalized recommendations. The online bootstrapping-based technique provides a principled way for UCB-type exploitation-exploration algorithms, while being able to handle arbitrary sized datasets, well suited to learn the ever evolving user preference drift from streaming data, and essentially parameter-free. We further introduce techniques to handle arbitrary sized feature spaces using feature hashing, leverage existing state-of-art machine learning via learning reduction, and increase cache hits by managing bootstrapped models in memory effectively. The resulted model trains on millions of examples and billions of features within minutes on a single personal computer. It shows persistent performance in both offline and online evaluation. We observe around 10% click through rate (CTR) and conversion lift over a collaborative filtering approach in real-world A/B testing across more than 40 million users on the major Ticketmaster email recommendation product.</p>

    <h3>Powering Content Discovery through Scalable, Realtime Profiling of Users’ Content Preferences (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roy Bass, Baruch Brutman, Yoram Dayagi, Ido Tamir, Guy Kobrinsky, Ronny Lempel</p>
    <p>Outbrain is the Web’s leading content discovery service, recommending billions of stories daily to a global audience across many of the world’s most prestigious and respected publishers. Outbrain’s recommendation technology combines contextual cues with personalization, where the personalization aspects are a combination of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. This paper, and the accompanying demo of a production system, offer a behind-the-scenes view of the content-based aspects of Outbrain’s personalization technology. We detail the types of features we extract from content, as well as the attributes we keep in each user’s content-affinity profile. We then describe and demonstrate how we update each user’s profile, in real time, as the user consumes content while browsing the Web.</p>
