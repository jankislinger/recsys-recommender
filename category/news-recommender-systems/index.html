    <h3>Bridging Viewpoints in News with Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia Hua Jeng</p>
    <p>News Recommender systems (NRSs) aid in decision-making in news media. However, undesired effects can emerge. Among these are selective exposures that may contribute to polarization, potentially reinforcing existing attitudes through belief perseverance—discounting contrary evidence due to their opposing attitudinal strength. This can be unsafe for people, making it difficult to accept information objectively. A crucial issue in news recommender system research is how to mitigate these undesired effects by designing recommender interfaces and machine learning models that enable people to consider to be more open to different perspectives. Alongside accurate models, the user experience is an equally important measure. Indeed, the core statistics are based on users’ behaviors and experiences in this research project. Therefore, this research agenda aims to steer the choices of readers’ based on altering their attitudes. The core methods plan to concentrate on the interface design and ML model building involving manipulations of cues, users’ behaviors prediction, NRSs algorithm and changing the nudges. In sum, the project aims to provide insight in the extent to which news recommender systems can be effective in mitigating polarized opinions.</p>

    <h3>How Should We Measure Filter Bubbles? A Regression Model and Evidence for Online News (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Verachtert, Jens Leysen, Annelien Smets, Jorre Vannieuwenhuyze, Lien Michiels, Bart Goethals</p>
    <p>News media play an important role in democratic societies.  Central to fulfilling this role is the premise that users should be exposed to diverse news.  However, news recommender systems are gaining popularity on news websites, which has sparked concerns over filter bubbles. Editors, policy-makers and scholars are worried that news recommender systems may expose users to less diverse content over time.  To the best of our knowledge, this hypothesis has not been tested in a longitudinal observational study of real users that interact with a real news website. Such observational studies require the use of research methods that are robust and can account for the many covariates that may influence the diversity of recommendations at any given time. In this work, we propose an analysis model to study whether the variety of articles recommended to a user decreases over time, in observational studies of real news websites with real users. Further, we present results from two case studies using aggregated and anonymized data that were collected by two western European news websites employing a collaborative filtering-based news recommender system to serve (personalized) recommendations to their users. Through these case studies we validate empirically that our modeling assumptions are sound and supported by the data, and that our model obtains more reliable and interpretable results than analysis methods used in prior empirical work on filter bubbles. Our case studies provide evidence of a small decrease in the topic variety of a user’s recommendations in the first weeks after they sign up, but no evidence of a decrease in political variety.</p>

    <h3>Greedy Optimized Multileaving for Personalization (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kojiro Iizuka, Yoshifumi Seki, Takeshi Yoneda</p>
    <p>Personalization plays an important role in many services. To evaluate personalized rankings, online evaluation, such as A/B testing, is widely used today. Recently, multileaving has been found to be an efficient method for evaluating rankings in information retrieval fields. This paper describes the first attempt to optimize the multileaving method for personalization settings. We clarify the challenges of applying this method to personalized rankings. Then, to solve these challenges, we propose greedy optimized multileaving (GOM) with a new credit feedback function. The empirical results showed that GOM was stable for increasing ranking lengths and the number of rankers. We implemented GOM on our actual news recommender systems, and compared its online performance. The results showed that GOM evaluated the personalized rankings precisely, with significantly smaller sample sizes (< 1/10) than A/B testing. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Designing for the Better by Taking Users into Account: A Qualitative Evaluation of User Control Mechanisms in (News) Recommender Systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaron Harambam, Mykola Makhortykh, Dimitrios Bountouridis, Joris van Hoboken</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RS) are on the rise in many domains. While they offer great promises, they also raise concerns: lack of transparency, reduction of diversity, little to no user control. In this paper, we align with the normative turn in computer science which scrutinizes the ethical and societal implications of RS. We focus and elaborate on the concept of user control because that mitigates multiple problems at once. Taking the news industry as our domain, we conducted four focus groups, or moderated think-aloud sessions, with Dutch news readers (N=21) to systematically study how people evaluate different control mechanisms (at the input, process, and output phase) in a News Recommender Prototype (NRP). While these mechanisms are sometimes met with distrust about the actual control they offer, we found that an intelligible user profile (including reading history and flexible preferences settings), coupled with possibilities to influence the recommendation algorithms is highly valued, especially when these control mechanisms can be operated in relation to achieving personal goals. By bringing (future) users’ perspectives to the fore, this paper contributes to a  richer understanding of why and how to design for user control in recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Offline and Online Evaluation of News Recommender Systems at swissinfo.ch (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Donatsch, Amr Huber, Florent Garcin, Boi Faltings, Ayar Alazzawi, Christophe Bruttin</p>
    <p>We report on the live evaluation of various news recommender systems conducted on the website swissinfo.ch. We demonstrate that there is a major difference between offline and online accuracy evaluations. In an offline setting, recommending most popular stories is the best strategy, while in a live environment this strategy is the poorest. For online setting, context-tree recommender systems which profile the users in real-time improve the click-through rate by up to 35%. The visit length also increases by a factor of 2.5. Our experience holds important lessons for the evaluation of recommender systems with offline data as well as for the use of the click-through rate as a performance indicator.</p>
