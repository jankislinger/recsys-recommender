    <h3>Enhancing Counterfactual Evaluation and Learning for Recommendation Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolò Felicioni</p>
    <p>Evaluating recommendation systems is a task of utmost importance and a very active research field. While online evaluation is the most reliable evaluation procedure, it may also be too expensive to perform, if not unfeasible. Therefore, researchers and practitioners resort to offline evaluation. Offline evaluation is much more efficient and scalable, but traditional approaches suffer from high bias. This issue led to the increased popularity of counterfactual techniques. These techniques are used for evaluation and learning in recommender systems and reduce the bias in offline evaluation. While counterfactual approaches have a solid statistical basis, their application to recommendation systems is still in a preliminary research phase. In this paper, we identify some limitations of counterfactual techniques applied to recommender systems, and we propose possible ways to overcome them.</p>

    <h3>Transfer Learning in Collaborative Recommendation for Bias Reduction (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weike Pan, Dugang Liu, Zinan Lin, Zhong Ming</p>
    <p>In a recommender system, a user’s interaction is often biased by the items’ displaying positions and popularity, as well as the user’s self-selection. Most existing recommendation models are built using such a biased user-system interaction data. In this paper, we first additionally introduce a specially collected unbiased data and then propose a novel transfer learning solution, i.e., transfer via joint reconstruction (TJR), to achieve knowledge transfer and sharing between the biased data and unbiased data. Specifically, in our TJR, we refine the prediction via the latent features containing bias information in order to obtain a more accurate and unbiased prediction. Moreover, we integrate the two data by reconstructing their interaction in a joint learning manner. We then adopt three representative methods as the backbone models of our TJR and conduct extensive empirical studies on two public datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of our transfer learning solution over some very competitive baselines.</p>
