    <h3>Towards Green Recommender Systems: Investigating the Impact of Data Reduction on Carbon Footprint and Algorithm Performances (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michela Milano, Cataldo Musto, Allegra De Filippo, Giuseppe Spillo, Giovanni Semeraro</p>
    <p>This work investigates the path toward green recommender systems by examining the impact of data reduction on both model performance and carbon footprint. In the pursuit of developing energy-efficient recommender systems, we investigated whether and how reducting training data impacts the performances of several representative recommendation models. In order to obtain a fair comparison, all the models were run based on the implementations available in a popular recommendation library, i.e., RecBole, and used the same experimental settings. Results indicate that: (a) data reduction can be a promising strategy to make recommender systems more sustainable at the cost of a lower accuracy; (b) training recommender systems with less data makes the suggestions more diverse and less biased. Overall, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the development of recommendation models that meet the principles of SDGs, laying the groundwork for the adoption of more sustainable practices in the field.</p>

    <h3>Station and Track Attribute-Aware Music Personalization (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Jeffrey Mei, Oliver Bembom, Andreas Ehmann</p>
    <p>We present a transformer for music personalization that recommends tracks given a station seed (artist) and improves the accuracy vs. a baseline matrix factorization method by 10%. Adding more embeddings to capture track and station attributes further improves the accuracy of our recommendations, and also improves recommendation diversity, i.e. mitigates popularity bias. We analyze the learned embeddings and find they learn both explicit attributes provided at training and implicit attributes that may inform listener preferences. We also find that unlike matrix factorization, our model can identify and transfer relevant listener preferences across different genres and artists.</p>

    <h3>Going Beyond Local: Global Graph-Enhanced Personalized News Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irene Li, Ruihai Dong, Dairui Liu, Toyotaro Suzumura, Boming Yang</p>
    <p>Precisely recommending candidate news articles to users has always been a core challenge for personalized news recommendation systems. Most recent work primarily focuses on using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract semantic information from rich textual data, employing content-based methods derived from locally viewed historical clicked news. However, this approach lacks a global perspective, failing to account for users’ hidden motivations and behaviors beyond semantic information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model called GLORY(Global-LOcal news Recommendation sYstem), which combines global news representations learned from other users with local news representations to enhance personalized recommendation systems. We accomplish this by constructing a Global Clicked News Encoder, which includes a global news graph and employs gated graph neural networks to fuse news representations, thereby enriching clicked news representations. Similarly, we extend this approach to a Global Candidate News Encoder, utilizing a global entity graph and candidate news fusion to enhance candidate news representation. Evaluation results on two public news datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Furthermore, our model offers more diverse recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Intent-Aware Diversification using Item-Based SubProfiles (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mesut Kaya, Derek Bridge</p>
    <p>In many approaches to recommendation diversification, a recommender scores items for relevance and then re-ranks them to balance relevance with diversity. In intent-aware diversification, diversity is formulated in terms of coverage of aspects, where aspects are either explicit such as movie genres or implicit such as the latent factors found during matrix factorization. Typically, the same set of aspects is used across all users. In this paper, we propose a form of personalized intent-aware diversification, which we call SPAD (SubProfile-Aware Diversification). The aspects we use in SPAD are subprofiles of the user’s profile. They are not defined in terms of explicit or implicit features. We compare SPAD to other forms of intent-aware diversification. We present empirical results in support of SPAD.</p>

    <h3>User Segmentation for Controlling Recommendation Diversity (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farzad Eskandanian, Bamshad Mobasher, Robin Burke</p>
    <p>The quality of recommendations is known to be affected by diversity and novelty in addition to accuracy. Recent work has focused on methods that increase diversity of recommendation lists. However, these methods assume the user preference for diversity is constant across all users. In this paper, we show that users’ propensity towards diversity varies greatly and argue that the diversity of recommendation lists should be consistent with the level of user interest in diverse recommendations. We introduce a user segmentation approach in order to personalize recommendation according to user preference for diversity. We show that recommendations generated using these segments match the diversity preferences of users in each segment. We also discuss the impact of this segmentation on the novelty of recommendations.</p>

    <h3>A Probabilistic Model for Using Social Networks in Personalized Item Recommendation (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tinpa Eliassi-Rad, David M. Blei, Allison J.B. Chaney</p>
    <p>Preference-based recommendation systems have transformed how we consume media. By analyzing usage data, these methods uncover our latent preferences for items (such as articles or movies) and form recommendations based on the behavior of others with similar tastes. But traditional preference-based recommendations do not account for the social aspect of consumption, where a trusted friend might point us to an interesting item that does not match our typical preferences. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between preference- and social-based recommendations. We develop (SPF), a probabilistic model that incorporates social network information into a traditional factorization method; SPF introduces the social aspect to algorithmic recommendation. We develop a scalable algorithm for analyzing data with SPF, and demonstrate that it outperforms competing methods on six real-world datasets; data sources include a social reader and Etsy.</p>
