    <h3>Playlist Search Reinvented: LLMs Behind the Curtain (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tarun Sharma, Siddharth Sharma, Geetha Aluri, Joaquin Delgado</p>
    <p>Improving search functionality poses challenges such as data scarcity for model training, metadata enrichment for comprehensive document indexing, and the labor-intensive manual annotation for evaluation. Traditionally, iterative methods relying on human annotators and customer feedback have been used. However, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new solutions. This paper focuses on applying LLMs to playlist search in Amazon Music. Leveraging LLMs’ contextual understanding and generative capabilities automates metadata enrichment, reducing manual efforts and expediting training. LLMs also address data scarcity by generating synthetic training data and serve as scalable judges for evaluation, enhancing search performance assessment. We demonstrate how these innovations enhance playlist search, overcoming traditional limitations to improve search result accuracy and relevance.</p>

    <h3>Towards Open-World Recommendation with Knowledge Augmentation from Large Language Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiwen Liu, Bo Chen, Yong Yu, Hong Zhu, Yunjia Xi, Weinan Zhang, Jianghao Lin, Xiaoling Cai, Jieming Zhu, Ruiming Tang</p>
    <p>Recommender system plays a vital role in various online services. However, its insulated nature of training and deploying separately within a specific closed domain limits its access to open-world knowledge. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in bridging this gap by encoding extensive world knowledge and demonstrating reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, previous attempts to directly use LLMs as recommenders cannot meet the inference latency demand of industrial recommender systems. In this work, we propose an Open-World Knowledge Augmented Recommendation Framework with Large Language Models, dubbed KAR, to acquire two types of external knowledge from LLMs — the reasoning knowledge on user preferences and the factual knowledge on items. We introduce factorization prompting to elicit accurate reasoning on user preferences. The generated reasoning and factual knowledge are effectively transformed and condensed into augmented vectors by a hybrid-expert adaptor in order to be compatible with the recommendation task. The obtained vectors can then be directly used to enhance the performance of any recommendation model. We also ensure efficient inference by preprocessing and prestoring the knowledge from the LLM. Extensive experiments show that KAR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and is compatible with a wide range of recommendation algorithms. We deploy KAR to Huawei’s news and music recommendation platforms and gain a 7% and 1.7% improvement in the online A/B test, respectively.</p>

    <h3>It’s Not You, It’s Me: The Impact of Choice Models and Ranking Strategies on Gender Imbalance in Music Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Ekstrand, Andres Ferraro, Christine Bauer</p>
    <p>As recommender systems are prone to various biases, mitigation approaches are needed to ensure that recommendations are fair to various stakeholders. One particular concern in music recommendation is artist gender fairness. Recent work has shown that the gender imbalance in the sector translates to the output of music recommender systems, creating a feedback loop that can reinforce gender biases over time. In this work, we examine whether algorithmic strategies or user behavior are a greater contributor to ongoing improvement (or loss) in fairness as models are repeatedly re-trained on new user feedback data. We simulate this repeated process to investigate the effects of ranking strategies and user choice models on gender fairness metrics. We find re-ranking strategies have a greater effect than user choice models on recommendation fairness over time</p>

    <h3>User knowledge prompt for sequential recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuuki Tachioka</p>
    <p>The large language model (LLM) based recommendation system is effective for sequential recommendation, because general knowledge of popular items is included in the LLM. To add domain knowledge of items, the conventional method uses a knowledge prompt obtained from the item knowledge graphs and has achieved SOTA performance. However, for personalized recommendation, it is necessary to consider user knowledge, which the conventional method does not fully consider because user knowledge is not included in the item knowledge graphs; thus, we propose a user knowledge prompt, which converts a user knowledge graph into a prompt using the relationship template. The existing prompt denoising framework is extended to prevent hallucination caused by undesirable interactions between knowledge graph prompts. We propose user knowledge prompts of user traits and user preferences and associate relevant items. Experiments on three types of dataset (movie, music, and book) show the significant and consistent improvement of our proposed user knowledge prompt.</p>

    <h3>A Multimodal Single-Branch Embedding Network for Recommendation in Cold-Start and Missing Modality Scenarios (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Hausberger, Markus Schedl, Christian Ganhör, Shah Nawaz, Marta Moscati</p>
    <p>Most recommender systems adopt collaborative filtering (CF) and provide recommendations based on past collective interactions. Therefore, the performance of CF algorithms degrades when few or no interactions are available, a scenario referred to as cold-start. To address this issue, previous work relies on models leveraging both collaborative data and side information on the users or items. Similar to multimodal learning, these models aim at combining collaborative and content representations in a shared embedding space. In this work we propose a novel technique for multimodal recommendation, relying on a multimodal Single-Branch embedding network for Recommendation (SiBraR). Leveraging weight-sharing, SiBraR encodes interaction data as well as multimodal side information using the same single-branch embedding network on different modalities. This makes SiBraR effective in scenarios of missing modality, including cold start. Our extensive experiments on large-scale recommendation datasets from three different recommendation domains (music, movie, and e-commerce) and providing multimodal content information (audio, text, image, labels, and interactions) show that SiBraR significantly outperforms CF as well as state-of-the-art content-based RSs in cold-start scenarios, and is competitive in warm scenarios. We show that SiBraR’s recommendations are accurate in missing modality scenarios, and that the model is able to map different modalities to the same region of the shared embedding space, hence reducing the modality gap.</p>

    <h3>LyricLure: Mining Catchy Hooks in Song Lyrics to Enhance Music Discovery and Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tarun Sharma, Siddharth Sharma, Joaquin Delgado, Ajinkya Walimbe, Akshay Shukla</p>
    <p>Amazon Music encounters a significant challenge as users increasingly rely on catchy lines from lyrics to search for both new releases and other popular songs. Integrating lyrics into existing lexical search index or using lyrics vector index pose difficulties due to lyrics text length. While lexical scoring mechanisms like BM25 are inadequate and necessitates complex query planning and index schema for long text, text embedding similarity based techniques often retrieve noisy near-similar meaning lyrics, resulting in low precision. This paper introduces a proactive approach to extract catchy phrases from song lyrics, overcoming the limitations of conventional graph-based phrase extractors and deep learning models, which are primarily designed for extractive summarization or task-specific key phrase extraction from domain-specific corpora. Additionally, we employ a multi-step mechanism to mine search query logs for potential unresolved user queries containing catchy phrases from lyrics. This involves creation of word and character k-gram index for lyric chunks, careful query and lyrics domain-centric normalization (and expansion) and a re-ranking layer incorporating lexical and well as semantic similarity. Together these strategies helped us create a high retrieval source specifically for serving lyrics intent queries with high recall.</p>

    <h3>Accelerating Creator Audience Building through Centralized Exploration (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilherme Dinis Junior, Olayinka S. Folorunso, Gösta Forsum, Maksym Lefarov, Lucas Maystre, Antonina Danylenko, Buket Baran, Yu Zhao</p>
    <p>On Spotify, multiple recommender systems enable personalized user experiences across a wide range of product features. These systems are owned by different teams and serve different goals, but all of these systems need to explore and learn about new content as it appears on the platform. In this work, we describe ongoing efforts at Spotify to develop an efficient solution to this problem, by centralizing content exploration and providing signals to existing, decentralized recommendation systems (a.k.a. exploitation systems). We take a creator-centric perspective, and argue that this approach can dramatically reduce the time it takes for new content to reach its full potential.</p>

    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cassandra Raineault, Kieran Bentley, Griffin Homan, Paul Gagliano, April Trainor, Elizabeth Richards, Douglas Turnbull, Victoria Conrad</p>
    <p>Cities with strong local music scenes enjoy many social and economic benefits.  To this end, we are interested in developing a locally-focused artist and event recommendation system called Localify.org that supports and promotes local music scenes. Local artists tend to be relatively obscure and reside in the long tail of the artist’s popularity distribution. In this demo paper, we describe both the overall system architecture as well as our core recommender system that uses artist-artist similarity information as opposed to user-artist preference information. We also discuss the role of popularity bias and how we attempt to ameliorate it in the context of local music recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Integrating the ACT-R Framework with Collaborative Filtering for Explainable Sequential Music Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Wallmann, Markus Schedl, Elisabeth Lex, Dominik Kowald, Marta Moscati, Markus Reiter-Haas</p>
    <p>Music listening sessions often consist of sequences including repeating tracks. Modeling such relistening behavior with models of human memory has been proven effective in predicting the next track of a session. However, these models intrinsically lack the capability of recommending novel tracks that the target user has not listened to in the past. Collaborative filtering strategies, on the contrary, provide novel recommendations by leveraging past collective behaviors but are often limited in their ability to provide explanations. To narrow this gap, we propose four hybrid algorithms that integrate collaborative filtering with the cognitive architecture ACT-R. We compare their performance in terms of accuracy, novelty, diversity, and popularity bias, to baselines of different types, including pure ACT-R, kNN-based, and neural-networks-based approaches. We show that the proposed algorithms are able to achieve the best performances in terms of novelty and diversity, and simultaneously achieve a higher accuracy of recommendation with respect to pure ACT-R models. Furthermore, we illustrate how the proposed models can provide explainable recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Optimizing Podcast Discovery: Unveiling Amazon Music’s Retrieval and Ranking Framework (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Greyson, Geetha Aluri, Joaquin Delgado</p>
    <p>This work presents the search architecture of Amazon Music, which is a highly efficient system designed to retrieve relevant content for users. The architecture consists of three key stages: indexing, retrieval, and ranking. During the indexing stage, data is meticulously parsed and processed to create a comprehensive index that contains dense representations and essential information about each document (such as a music or podcast entity) in the collection, including its title, metadata, and relevant attributes. This indexing process enables fast and efficient data access during retrieval. The retrieval stage utilizes multi-faceted retrieval strategies, resulting in improved identification of candidate matches compared to traditional structured search methods. Subsequently, candidates are ranked based on their relevance to the customer’s query, taking into account document features and personalized factors. With a specific focus on the podcast use case, this paper highlights the deployment of the architecture and demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing podcast search capabilities, providing tailored and engaging content experiences.</p>

    <h3>Exploring the longitudinal effect of nudging on users’ genre exploration behavior and listening preference (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martijn C. Willemsen, Yu Liang</p>
    <p>Previous studies on exploration have shown that users can be nudged to explore further away from their current preferences. However, these effects were shown in a single session study, while it often takes time to explore new tastes and develop new preferences. In this work, we present a longitudinal study on users’ exploration behavior and behavior change over time after they have used a music genre exploration tool for four sessions in six weeks. We test two relevant nudges to help them explore more: the starting point (the personalization of the default initial playlist) and the visualization of users’ previous position(s). Our results show that the personalization level of the default initial playlist in the first session influences the preferred personalization level users set in the second session but fades away in later sessions as users start exploring in different directions. Visualization of users’ previous positions did not anchor users to stay closer to the initial defaults. Over time, users perceived the playlist to be more personalized to their tastes and helpful to explore the genre. Perceived helpfulness increased more when users explored further away from their current preferences. Apart from differences in self-reported measures, we also find some objective evidence for preference change in users’ top tracks from their Spotify profile, that over the period of 6 weeks moved somewhat closer to the genre that users selected to explore with the tool.</p>

    <h3>Analyzing Item Popularity Bias of Music Recommender Systems: Are Different Genders Equally Affected? (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Navid Rekabsaz, Elisabeth Lex, Dominik Kowald, Stefan Brandl, Markus Schedl, Alessandro Melchiorre, Oleg Lesota</p>
    <p>Several studies have identified discrepancies between the popularity of items in user profiles and the corresponding recommendation lists. Such behavior, which concerns a variety of recommendation algorithms, is referred to as popularity bias. Existing work predominantly adopts simple statistical measures, such as the difference of mean or median popularity, to quantify popularity bias. Moreover, it does so irrespective of user characteristics other than the inclination to popular content. In this work, in contrast, we propose to investigate popularity differences (between the user profile and recommendation list) in terms of median, a variety of statistical moments, as well as similarity measures that consider the entire popularity distributions (Kullback-Leibler divergence and Kendall’s τ rank-order correlation). This results in a more detailed picture of the characteristics of popularity bias. Furthermore, we investigate whether such algorithmic popularity bias affects users of different genders in the same way. We focus on music recommendation and conduct experiments on the recently released standardized LFM-2b dataset, containing listening profiles of Last.fm users. We investigate the algorithmic popularity bias of seven common recommendation algorithms (five collaborative filtering and two baselines). Our experiments show that (1) the studied metrics provide novel insights into popularity bias in comparison with only using average differences, (2) algorithms less inclined towards popularity bias amplification do not necessarily perform worse in terms of utility (NDCG), (3) the majority of the investigated recommenders intensify the popularity bias of the female users.</p>

    <h3>Automatic Collection Creation and Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manjeet Dahiya, Piyush Singh, Sanidhya Singal</p>
    <p>We present a collection recommender system that can automatically create and recommend collections of items at a user level. Unlike regular recommender systems, which output top-N relevant items, a collection recommender system outputs collections of items such that the items in the collections are relevant to a user, and the items within a collection follow a specific theme. Our system builds on top of the user-item representations learnt by item recommender systems. We employ dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques along with intuitive heuristics to create collections with their ratings and titles. We test these ideas in a real-world setting of music recommendation, within a popular music streaming service. We find that there is a 2.3x increase in recommendation-driven consumption when recommending collections over items. Further, it results in effective utilization of real estate and leads to recommending a more and diverse set of items. To our knowledge, these are first of its kind experiments at such a large scale.</p>

    <h3>Sparse Feature Factorization for Recommender Systems with Knowledge Graphs (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonio Ferrara, Alberto Carlo Maria Mancino, Vito Walter Anelli, Tommaso Di Noia</p>
    <p>Deep Learning and factorization-based collaborative filtering recommendation models have undoubtedly dominated the scene of recommender systems in recent years. However, despite their outstanding performance, these methods require a training time proportional to the size of the embeddings and it further increases when also side information is considered for the computation of the recommendation list. In fact, in these cases we have that with a large number of high-quality features, the resulting models are more complex and difficult to train. This paper addresses this problem by presenting KGFlex: a sparse factorization approach that grants an even greater degree of expressiveness. To achieve this result, KGFlex analyzes the historical data to understand the dimensions the user decisions depend on (e.g., movie direction, musical genre, nationality of book writer). KGFlex represents each item feature as an embedding and it models user-item interactions as a factorized entropy-driven combination of the item attributes relevant to the user. KGFlex facilitates the training process by letting users update only those relevant features on which they base their decisions. In other words, the user-item prediction is mediated by the user’s personal view that considers only relevant features. An extensive experimental evaluation shows the approach’s effectiveness, considering the recommendation results’ accuracy, diversity, and induced bias. The public implementation of KGFlex is available at https://split.to/kgflex.</p>

    <p>In the music domain, repeated consumption is not uncommon. In this work, we explore how to recommend familiar music in fresh ways. Specifically, we design algorithms that can produce ‘tours’ through a small personal collection of songs. The tours are decorated with segues, which are textual connections between consecutive songs, chosen for their interestingness. We present three such algorithms, and we outline their strengths and weaknesses based on a comparative offline evaluation.
