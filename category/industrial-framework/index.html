    <h3>Short-form Video Needs Long-term Interests: An Industrial Solution for Serving Large User Sequence Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Most, Yuening Li, Qingyun Liu, Liang Liu, Xinyang Yi, Junjie Shan, Shuchao Bi, Lichan Hong, Chuan He, Jiaxi Tang, Diego Uribe, Kaushik Kalyan, Ed Chi</p>
    <p>Sequential models are invaluable for powering personalized recommendation systems. In the context of short-form video (SFV) feeds, where user behavior history is typically longer, there’s a need for a system to handle users’ long-term interests. However, deploying large sequence models to extensive web-scale applications faces challenges due to high serving cost. To address this, we propose an industrial framework designed for efficiently serving large user sequence models. Specifically, the proposed infrastructure decouples the serving of user sequence model and the main recommendation model, with user sequence model served offline (in an asynchronous manner) with periodical refresh. The proposed infrastructure is also model-agnostic; thus, it can be used to support any types of user sequence models (even LLMs) with controllable costs. Empirical results show that large user models deployed with our framework significantly and consistently enhances the quality of the main recommendation model, with minimal serving costs increase.</p>

    <h3>An Industrial Framework for Personalized Serendipitous Recommendation in E-commerce (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sulong Xu, Anyu Dai, Zhuoye Ding, Linfang Hou, Mian Ma, Luobao Zou, Yanyan Zou, Zongyi Wang, Nan Qiao</p>
    <p>Classical recommendation methods typically face the filter bubble problem where users likely receive recommendations of their familiar items, making them bored and dissatisfied. To alleviate such an issue, this applied paper introduces a novel framework for personalized serendipitous recommendation in an e-commerce platform (i.e., JD.com), which allows to present user unexpected and satisfying items deviating from user’s prior behaviors, considering both accuracy and novelty. To achieve such a goal, it is crucial yet challenging to recognize when a user is willing to receive serendipitous items and how many novel items are expected. To address above two challenges, a two-stage framework is designed. Firstly, a DNN-based scorer is deployed to quantify the novelty degree of a product category based on user behavior history. Then, we resort to a potential outcome framework to decide the optimal timing to recommend a user serendipitous items and the novelty degree of the recommendation. Online A/B test on the e-commerce recommender platform in JD.com demonstrates that our model achieves significant gains on various metrics, 0.54% relative increase of impressive depth, 0.8% of average user click count, 3.23%  and 1.38% of number of novel impressive and clicked items individually.</p>
