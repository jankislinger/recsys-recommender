    <h3>Re2Dan: Retrieval of medical documents for e-Health in Danish (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafael Pablos, Ira Assent, Antonela Tommasel</p>
    <p>With the clinical environment becoming more data-reliant, healthcare professionals now have unparalleled access to comprehensive clinical information from numerous sources. Then, one of the main issues is how to avoid overloading practitioners with large amounts of (irrelevant) information while guiding them to the relevant documents for specific patient cases. Additional challenges appear due to the shortness of queries and the presence of long (and maybe noisy) contextual information. This demo presents Re2Dan, a web Retrieval and recommender of Danish medical documents. Re2Dan leverages several techniques to improve the quality of retrieved documents. First, it combines lexical and semantic searches to understand the meaning and context of user queries, allowing the retrieval of documents that are conceptually similar to the user’s query. Second, it recommends similar queries, allowing users to discover related documents and insights. Third, when given contextual information (e.g., from patients’ clinical notes), it suggests medical concepts to expand the user query, enabling a more focused search scope and thus obtaining more accurate recommendations. Preliminary analyses showed the effectiveness of the recommender in improving the relevance and comprehensiveness of recommendations, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in finding relevant information for informed decision-making.</p>

    <h3>StoryTime: Eliciting Preferences from Children for Book Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Keener, Michael Green, Michael D. Ekstrand, Ashlee Milton, Joshua Ames, Maria Soledad Pera</p>
    <p>We present StoryTime, a book recommender for children. Our web-based recommender is co-designed with children and uses images to elicit their preferences. By building on existing solutions related to both visual interfaces and book recommendation strategies for children, StoryTime can generate suggestions without historical data or adult guidance. We discuss the benefits of StoryTime as a starting point for further research exploring the cold start problem, incorporating historical data, and needs related to children as a complex audience to enhance the recommendation process.</p>

    <h3>Eliciting Pairwise Preferences in Recommender Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Ricci, Saikishore Kalloori, Rosella Gennari</p>
    <p>Preference data in the form of ratings or likes for items are widely used in many Recommender Systems (RSs). However, previous research has shown that even item comparisons, which generate pairwise preference data, can be used to model user preferences. Moreover, pairwise preferences can be effectively combined with ratings to compute recommendations. In such hybrid approaches, the RS requires to elicit from the user both types of preference data. In this work, we aim at identifying how and when to elicit pairwise preferences, i.e., when this form of user preference data is more meaningful for the user to express and more beneficial for the system. We conducted an online A/B test and compared a rating-only based system variant with another variant that allows the user to enter both types of preferences. Our results demonstrate that pairwise preferences are valuable and useful especially when the user is focusing on a specific type of items and by incorporating pairwise preferences, the system can generate better recommendations than a state of the art rating-only based solution. Additionally, our results indicate that there exists a dependency between the user’s personality and the perceived system usability and the satisfaction for the preference elicitation procedure, which varies if only ratings or a combination of ratings and pairwise preferences are elicited.</p>

    <h3>Acquisition of Music Pairwise Scores and Facial Expressions (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matija Marolt, Nima Maleki, Matevž Pesek, Mehdi Elahi, Marko Tkalcic, Francesco Ricci</p>
    <p>We present a research tool for user preference elicitation that collects both explicit user feedback and unobtrusively acquired facial expressions. The concrete implementation is a web-based user interface where the user is presented with two music excerpts. After listening to both, the user provides a pairwise score (i.e. which of the two items is preferred) for each pair of music excerpts. The novelty of the demo is the integration of the unobtrusive acquisition of facial expressions through the webcam. During the listening of the music excerpts, the system extracts features related to the facial expressions of the user several times per second. The interaction runs as a web application, which allows for a large-scale remote acquisition of emotional data. Up to now, such acquisitions were usually done in controlled environments with few subjects, hence being of little use for the recommender systems community.</p>
