    <h3>Incorporating Time in Sequential Recommendation Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Caverlee, Mostafa Rahmani, Fei Wang</p>
    <p>Sequential models are designed to learn sequential patterns in data based on the chronological order of user interactions. However, they often ignore the timestamps of these interactions. Incorporating time is crucial because many sequential patterns are time-dependent, and the model cannot make time-aware recommendations without considering time. This article demonstrates that providing a rich representation of time can significantly improve the performance of sequential models. The existing literature treats time as a one-dimensional time-series obtained by quantizing time. In this study, we propose treating time as a multi-dimensional time-series and explore representation learning methods, including  a kernel based method and an embedding-based algorithm. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the inclusion of time significantly enhances the model’s performance, and multi-dimensional methods outperform the one-dimensional method by a substantial margin.</p>

    <h3>A Probabilistic Position Bias Model for Short-Video Recommendation Feeds (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Jeunen</p>
    <p>Modern web-based platforms often show ranked lists of recommendations to users, in an attempt to maximise user satisfaction or business metrics. Typically, the goal of such systems boils down to maximising the exposure probability — conversely, minimising the rank— for items that are deemed “reward-maximising” according to some metric of interest. This general framing comprises music or movie streaming applications, as well as e-commerce, restaurant or job recommendations, and even web search. Position bias or user models can be used to estimate exposure probabilities for each use-case, specifically tailored to how users interact with the presented rankings. A unifying factor in these diverse problem settings is that typically only one or several items will be engaged with (clicked, streamed, purchased, et cetera) before a user leaves the ranked list.  Short-video feeds on social media platforms diverge from this general framing in several ways, most notably that users do not tend to leave the feed after, for example, liking a post. Indeed, seemingly infinite feeds invite users to scroll further down the ranked list. For this reason, existing position bias or user models tend to fall short in such settings, as they do not accurately capture users’ interaction modalities. In this work, we propose a novel and probabilistically sound personalised position bias model for feed recommendations. We focus on a 1st-level feed in a hierarchical structure, where users may enter a 2nd-level feed via any given 1st-level item. We posit that users come to the platform with a given scrolling budget that is drawn according to a discrete power-law distribution, and show how the survival function of said distribution can be used to obtain closed-form estimates for personalised exposure probabilities. Empirical insights gained through data from a large-scale social media platform show how our probabilistic position bias model more accurately captures empirical exposure than existing models, and paves the way for improved unbiased evaluation and learning-to-rank.</p>

    <h3>Using Navigation to Improve Recommendations in Real-Time (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander J Smola, Justin Basilico, Christopher V Alvino, Chao-Yuan Wu</p>
    <p>Implicit feedback is a key source of information for many recommendation and personalization approaches. However, using it typically requires multiple episodes of interaction and roundtrips to a recommendation engine. This adds latency and neglects the opportunity of immediate personalization for a user the user is navigating recommendations. We propose a novel strategy to address the above problem in a principled manner. The key insight is that as we observe a user’s interactions, it reveals much more information about her desires. We exploit this by inferring the within-session user intent based on navigation interactions, since they offer valuable clues into a user’s current state of mind. Using navigation patterns and adapting recommendations in real-time creates an opportunity to provide more accurate recommendations. By prefetching a larger amount of content, this can be carried out entirely in the client (such as a browser) without added latency. We define a new Bayesian model with an efficient inference algorithm. We demonstrate significant improvements with this novel approach on a real-world, large-scale dataset from Netflix on the problem of adapting the recommendations on a user’s homepage.</p>
