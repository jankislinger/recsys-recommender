    <h3>Personalized Diffusions for Top-N Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitris Berberidis, George Karypis, Georgios B. Giannakis, Athanasios N. Nikolakopoulos</p>
    <p>This paper introduces PERDIF; a novel framework for learning personalized diffusions over item-to-item graphs for top-n recommendation. PERDIF learns the teleportation probabilities of a time-inhomogeneous random walk with restarts capturing a user-specific underlying item exploration process. Such an approach can lead to significant improvements in recommendation accuracy, while also providing useful information about the users in the system. Per-user fitting can be performed in parallel and very efficiently even in large-scale settings. A comprehensive set of experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the scalability as well as the qualitative merits of the proposed framework. PERDIF achieves high recommendation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art competing approachesâ€”including several recently proposed methods relying on deep neural networks.</p>

    <h3>HOP-Rec: High-Order Proximity for Implicit Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming-Feng Tsai, Chuan-Ju Wang, Jheng-Hong Yang, Chih-Ming Chen</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are vital ingredients for many e-commerce services. In the literature, two of the most popular approaches are based on factorization and graph-based models; the former approach captures user preferences by factorizing the observed direct interactions between users and items, and the latter extracts indirect preferences from the graphs constructed by user-item interactions. In this paper we present HOP-Rec, a unified and efficient method that incorporates the two approaches. The proposed method involves random surfing on a graph to harvest high-order information among neighborhood items for each user. Instead of factorizing a transition matrix, our method introduces a confidence weighting parameter to simulate all high-order information simultaneously, for which we maintain a sparse user-item interaction matrix and enrich the matrix for each user using random walks. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art on a range of large-scale real-world datasets.</p>

    <h3>Blockbusters and Wallflowers: Accurate, Diverse, and Scalable Recommendations with Random Walks (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chris Newell, Bibek Paudel, Fabian Christoffel, Abraham Bernstein</p>
    <p>User satisfaction is often dependent on providing accurate and diverse recommendations. In this paper, we explore scalable algorithms that exploit random walks as a sampling technique to obtain diverse recommendations without compromising on accuracy. Specifically, we present a novel graph vertex ranking recommendation algorithm called RP3beta that re-ranks items based on 3-hop random walk transition probabilities. We show empirically, that RP3beta provides accurate recommendations with high long-tail item frequency at the top of the recommendation list. We also present scalable approximate versions of RP3beta and the two most accurate previously published vertex ranking algorithms based on random walk transition probabilities and show that these approximations converge with increasing number of samples.</p>
