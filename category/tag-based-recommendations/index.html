    <h3>Bundle MCR: Towards Conversational Bundle Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhankui He, Sungchul Kim, Handong Zhao, Fan Du, Tong Yu, Julian McAuley</p>
    <p>Bundle recommender systems recommend sets of items (e.g., pants, shirt, and shoes) to users, but they often suffer from two issues: significant interaction sparsity and a large output space. In this work, we extend multi-round conversational recommendation (MCR) to alleviate these issues. MCR—which uses a conversational paradigm to elicit user interests by asking user preferences on tags (e.g., categories or attributes) and handling user feedback across multiple rounds—is an emerging recommendation setting to acquire user feedback and narrow down the output space, but has not been explored in the context of bundle recommendation. In this work, we propose a novel recommendation task named Bundle MCR. Unlike traditional bundle recommendation (a bundle-aware user model and bundle generation), Bundle MCR studies how to encode user feedback as conversation states and how to post questions to users. Unlike existing MCR in which agents recommend individual items only, Bundle MCR handles more complicated user feedback on multiple items and related tags. To support this, we first propose a new framework to formulate Bundle MCR as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with multiple agents, for user modeling, consultation and feedback handling in bundle contexts. Under this framework, we propose a model architecture, called Bundle Bert (Bunt) to (1) recommend items, (2) post questions and (3) manage conversations based on bundle-aware conversation states. Moreover, to train Bunt effectively, we propose a two-stage training strategy. In an offline pre-training stage, Bunt is trained using multiple cloze tasks to mimic bundle interactions in conversations. Then in an online fine-tuning stage, Bunt agents are enhanced by user interactions. Our experiments on multiple offline datasets as well as the human evaluation show the value of extending MCR frameworks to bundle settings and the effectiveness of our Bunt design.</p>

    <h3>Securing Tag-based recommender systems against profile injection attacks: A comparative study (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heri Ramampiaro, Helge Langseth, Georgios Pitsilis</p>
    <p>This work addresses challenges related to attacks on social tagging systems, which often comes in a form of malicious annotations or profile injection attacks. In particular, we study various countermeasures against two types of threats for such systems, the Overload and the Piggyback attacks. The studied countermeasures include baseline classifiers such as, Naive Bayes filter and Support Vector Machine, as well as a deep learning-based approach. Our evaluation performed over synthetic spam data, generated from del.icio.us, shows that in most cases, the deep learning-based approach provides the best protection against threats.</p>

    <h3>Interactive Food Recommendation for Groups (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehdi Elahi, Mouzhi Ge, Massimo David, Shlomo Berkovsky, Francesco Ricci</p>
    <p>We present a prototype of a novel interactive food recommender for groups of users that supports groups in planning their meals through a conversational process based on critiquing. The system comprises two novel elements: a user interface and interaction design based on tagging and critiquing, and a utility function incorporating healthiness and diet compliance factors.</p>
