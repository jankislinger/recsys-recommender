    <h3>Enhancing Recommendation Quality of the SASRec Model by Mitigating Popularity Bias (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xenija Neufeld, Sebastian Loth, Andreas Grün, Venkata Harshit Koneru</p>
    <p>ZDF is a Public Service Media (PSM) broadcaster in Germany that uses recommender systems on its streaming service platform ZDFmediathek. One of the main use cases within the ZDFmediathek is Next Video, which is currently based on a Self-Attention based Sequential Recommendation model (SASRec). For this use case, we modified the loss function, the sampling method of negative items, and introduced the top-k negative sampling strategy and compared this to the vanilla SASRec model. We show that this not only reduces popularity bias, but also increases clicks and the viewing volume compared to that of the vanilla version.</p>

    <h3>Unified Denoising Training for Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingpeng Du, Ziyan Wang, Haoyan Chua, Zhu Sun, Jie Zhang, Yew-Soon Ong</p>
    <p>Most existing denoising recommendation methods mainly alleviate noisy implicit feedback (user behaviors) through empirical studies. However, such studies may lack theoretical explainability and fail to model comprehensive noise patterns, which hinders understanding and capturing different noise patterns that show distinct effects on users’ behaviors. Thus, we propose to capture comprehensive noise patterns through a holistic theoretical analysis for more effective denoising, whereby users’ behaviors are divided into the willingness (to interact with) and action (to interact with) phases to disentangle the independent noise patterns. Our analysis unveils that (1) in the willingness phase, the high uncertainty of the user’s willingness to interact with the item can lead to high expectation loss, unifying explainability for existing denoising methods; and (2) in the action phase, higher user-specific inconsistency between willingness and action can not only lead to more noise in the user’s overall behaviors but also make it harder to distinguish between her true and noisy behaviors. All these findings are also aligned with our empirical observations. Inspired by these findings, we propose a Unified Denoising Training (UDT) method for recommendation. To alleviate uncertainty in the willingness phase, we lower the importance of the user-item interaction with high willingness uncertainty recognized by high loss. To ease the inconsistency in the action phase, we lower the overall importance for users with high user-specific inconsistency as it may lead to more noisy behaviors, and then increase the importance gap between recognized true and noisy behaviors for users with low user-specific inconsistency as their behaviors are more distinguishable. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our proposed UDT outperforms state-of-the-art denoising recommendation methods.</p>

    <h3>Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendations with Hyperbolic Representations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatyana Matveeva, Evgeny Frolov, Ivan Oseledets, Leyla Mirvakhabova</p>
    <p>In recent years, self-attentive sequential learning models have surpassed conventional collaborative filtering techniques in next-item recommendation tasks. However, Euclidean geometry utilized in these models may not be optimal for capturing a complex structure of behavioral data. Building on recent advances in the application of hyperbolic geometry to collaborative filtering tasks, we propose a novel approach that leverages hyperbolic geometry in the sequential learning setting. Our approach replaces final output of the Euclidean models with a linear predictor in the non-linear hyperbolic space, which increases the representational capacity and improves recommendation quality.</p>

    <h3>Revisiting LightGCN: Unexpected Inflexibility, Inconsistency, and A Remedy Towards Improved Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Geon Lee, Kijung Shin, Kyungho Kim</p>
    <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as effective tools in recommender systems. Among various GNN models, LightGCN is distinguished by its simplicity and outstanding performance. Its efficiency has led to widespread adoption across different domains, including social, bundle, and multimedia recommendations. In this paper, we thoroughly examine the mechanisms of LightGCN, focusing on its strategies for scaling embeddings, aggregating neighbors, and pooling embeddings across layers. Our analysis reveals that, contrary to expectations based on its design, LightGCN suffers from inflexibility and inconsistency when applied to real-world data. We introduce LightGCN++, an enhanced version of LightGCN designed to address the identified limitations. LightGCN++ incorporates flexible scaling of embedding norms and neighbor weighting, along with a tailored approach for pooling layer-wise embeddings to resolve the identified inconsistencies. Despite its remarkably simple remedy, extensive experimental results demonstrate that LightGCN++ significantly outperforms LightGCN, achieving an improvement of up to 17.81% in terms of NDCG@20. Furthermore, state-of-the-art models utilizing LightGCN as a backbone for item, bundle, multimedia, and knowledge-graph-based recommendations exhibit improved performance when equipped with LightGCN++.</p>

    <h3>Beyond the Sequence: Statistics-driven Pre-training for Stabilizing Sequential Recommendation Model (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongzhi Zhang, Sirui Wang, Yunsen Xian, Peiguang Li</p>
    <p>The sequential recommendation task aims to predict the item that user is interested in according to his/her historical action sequence. However, inevitable random action, i.e. user randomly accesses an item among multiple candidates or clicks several items at random order, cause the sequence fails to provide stable and high-quality signals. To alleviate the issue, we propose the StatisTics-Driven Pre-traing framework (called STDP briefly). The main idea of the work lies in the exploration of utilizing the statistics information along with the pre-training paradigm to stabilize the optimization of recommendation model. Specifically, we derive two types of statistical information: item co-occurrence across sequence and attribute frequency within the sequence. And we design the following pre-training tasks: 1) The co-occurred items prediction task, which encourages the model to distribute its attention on multiple suitable targets instead of just focusing on the next item that may be unstable. 2) We generate a paired sequence by replacing items with their co-occurred items and enforce its representation close with the original one, thus enhancing the model’s robustness to the random noise. 3) To reduce the impact of random on user’s long-term preferences, we encourage the model to capture sequence-level frequent attributes. The significant improvement over six datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposal, and further analysis verified the generalization of the STDP framework on other models.</p>

    <h3>Re2Dan: Retrieval of medical documents for e-Health in Danish (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafael Pablos, Ira Assent, Antonela Tommasel</p>
    <p>With the clinical environment becoming more data-reliant, healthcare professionals now have unparalleled access to comprehensive clinical information from numerous sources. Then, one of the main issues is how to avoid overloading practitioners with large amounts of (irrelevant) information while guiding them to the relevant documents for specific patient cases. Additional challenges appear due to the shortness of queries and the presence of long (and maybe noisy) contextual information. This demo presents Re2Dan, a web Retrieval and recommender of Danish medical documents. Re2Dan leverages several techniques to improve the quality of retrieved documents. First, it combines lexical and semantic searches to understand the meaning and context of user queries, allowing the retrieval of documents that are conceptually similar to the user’s query. Second, it recommends similar queries, allowing users to discover related documents and insights. Third, when given contextual information (e.g., from patients’ clinical notes), it suggests medical concepts to expand the user query, enabling a more focused search scope and thus obtaining more accurate recommendations. Preliminary analyses showed the effectiveness of the recommender in improving the relevance and comprehensiveness of recommendations, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in finding relevant information for informed decision-making.</p>

    <h3>Neighborhood-Based Collaborative Filtering for Conversational Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Mcauley, Zhouhang Xie, Nathan Kallus, Dawen Liang, Rahul Jha, Hyunsik Jeon, Zhankui He, Harald Steck, Junda Wu</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) should understand users’ expressed interests that are frequently semantically rich and knowledge intensive. Prior works attempt to address this challenge by making use of external knowledge bases or parametric knowledge in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we study a complementary solution, exploiting item knowledge in the training data. We hypothesise that many inference-time user requests can be answered via reusing popular crowd-written answers associated with similar training queries. Following this intuition, we define a class of neighborhood-based CRS that make recommendations by identifying popular items associated with similar training dialogue contexts. Experiments on Inspired, Redial, and Reddit benchmarks show that despite its simplicity, our method achieves comparable to better performance than state-of-the-art LLM-based methods with over 200 times more parameters. We also show neighborhood and model-based predictions can be combined to achieve further performance improvements over both components.</p>

    <h3>Disentangling Motives behind Item Consumption and Social Connection for Mutually-enhanced Joint Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yew Soon Ong, Jie Zhang, Zhu Sun, Youchen Sun, Xiao Sha</p>
    <p>Item consumption and social connection, as common user behaviors in many web applications, have been extensively studied. However, most current works separately perform either item or social link prediction tasks, possibly with the help of the other as an auxiliary signal. Moreover, they merely consider the behaviors in a holistic manner yet neglect the multi-faceted motives behind them (e.g., watching movies to kill time or with friends; connecting with others due to friendships or colleagues). To fill the gap, we propose to disentangle the multi-faceted motives in each network, defined respectively by the two types of behaviors, for mutually- enhanced joint prediction (DMJP). Specifically, we first learn the disentangled user representations driven by motives of multi-facets in both networks. Thereafter, the mutual influence of the two networks is subtly discriminated at the facet-to-facet level. The fine-grained mutual influence, proven to be asymmetric, is then exploited to help refine user representations in both networks, with the goal of achieving a mutually-enhanced joint item and social link prediction. Empirical studies on three public datasets showcase the superiority of DMJP against state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on both tasks.</p>

    <h3>Of Spiky SVDs and Music Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darius Afchar, Romain Hennequin, Vincent Guigue</p>
    <p>The truncated singular value decomposition is a widely used methodology in music recommendation for direct similar-item retrieval or embedding musical items for downstream tasks. This paper investigates a curious effect that we show naturally occurring on many recommendation datasets: spiking formations in the embedding space. We first propose a metric to quantify this spiking organization’s strength, then mathematically prove its origin tied to underlying communities of items of varying internal popularity. With this new-found theoretical understanding, we finally open the topic with an industrial use case of estimating how music embeddings’ top-k similar items will change over time under the addition of data.</p>

    <h3>Private Matrix Factorization with Public Item Features (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Walid Krichene, Mihaela Curmei, Li Zhang</p>
    <p>We consider the problem of training private recommendation models with access to public item features. Training with Differential Privacy (DP) offers strong privacy guarantees, at the expense of loss in recommendation quality. We show that incorporating public item features during training can help mitigate this loss in quality. We propose a general approach based on collective matrix factorization, that works by simultaneously factorizing two matrices: the user feedback matrix (representing sensitive data) and an item feature matrix that encodes publicly available (non-sensitive) item information. The method is conceptually simple, easy to tune, and highly scalable. It can be applied to different types of public data, including: (1) categorical item features; (2) item-item similarities learned from public sources; and (3) publicly available user feedback. Evaluating our method on a standard DP recommendation benchmark, we find that using public item features significantly narrows the quality gap between the private models and their non-private counterpart. As privacy constraints become more stringent, the increased reliance on public side features leads to recommendations becoming more depersonalized, resulting in a smooth transition from collaborative filtering to item-based contextual recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Distribution-based Learnable Filters with Side Information for Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Wang, Haibo Liu, Zhixiang Deng, Jinjia Peng, Shi Feng</p>
    <p>Sequential Recommendation aims to predict the next item by mining out the dynamic preference from user previous interactions. However, most methods represent each item as a single fixed vector, which is incapable of capturing the uncertainty of item-item transitions that result from time-dependent and multifarious interests of users. Besides, they fail to effectively exploit side information that helps to better express user preferences. At last, the noise in user’s access sequence, which is due to accidental clicks, can interfere with the next item prediction and lead to lower recommendation performance. To deal with these issues, we propose DLFS-Rec, a novel model that combines Distribution-based Learnable Filters with Side information for sequential Recommendation. Specifically, items and their side information are represented by stochastic Gaussian distribution, which is described by mean and covariance embeddings, and then the corresponding embeddings are fused to generate a final representation for each item. To attenuate noise, stacked learnable filter layers are applied to smooth the fused embeddings. The similarities between the distributions inferred from the last filter layer and candidates are measured by 2-Wasserstein distance for generating recommendation list. Extensive experiments on four public real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art baselines, especially on cold start users and items.</p>

    <h3>Aspect Re-distribution for Learning Better Item Embeddings in Sequential Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Cai, Jingwen Mao, Weike Pan, Zhechao Yu, Congfu Xu</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation has attracted a lot of attention from both academia and industry. Since item embeddings directly affect the recommendation results, their learning process is very important. However, most existing sequential models may introduce bias when updating the item embeddings. For example, in a sequence where all items are endorsed by a same celebrity, the co-occurrence of two items only indicates their similarity in terms of endorser, and is independent of the other aspects such as category and color. The existing models often update the entire item as a whole or update different aspects of the item without distinction, which fails to capture the contributions of different aspects to the co-occurrence pattern. To overcome the above limitations, we propose aspect re-distribution (ARD) to focus on updating the aspects that are important for co-occurrence. Specifically, we represent an item using several aspect embeddings with the same initial importance. We then re-calculate the importance of each aspect according to the other items in the sequence. Finally, we aggregate these aspect embeddings into a single aspect-aware embedding according to their importance. The aspect-aware embedding can be provided as input to a successor sequential model. Updates of the aspect-aware embedding are passed back to the aspect embeddings based on their importance. Therefore, different from the existing models, our method pays more attention to updating the important aspects. In our experiments, we choose self-attention networks as the successor model. The experimental results on four real-world datasets indicate that our method achieves very promising performance in comparison with seven state-of-the-art models.</p>

    <h3>Reducing Cross-Topic Political Homogenization in Content-Based News Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aron Culotta, Karthik Shivaram, Matthew Shapiro, Mustafa Bilgic, Ping Liu</p>
    <p>Content-based news recommenders learn words that correlate with user engagement and recommend articles accordingly. This can be problematic for users with diverse political preferences by topic — e.g., users that prefer conservative articles on one topic but liberal articles on another. In such instances, recommenders can have a homogenizing effect by recommending articles with the same political lean on both topics, particularly if both topics share salient, politically polarized terms like “far right” or “radical left.” In this paper, we propose attention-based neural network models to reduce this homogenization effect by increasing attention on words that are topic specific while decreasing attention on polarized, topic-general terms. We find that the proposed approach results in more accurate recommendations for simulated users with such diverse preferences.</p>

    <h3>Towards the Evaluation of Recommender Systems with Impressions (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando Benjamin Perez Maurera, Paolo Cremonesi, Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema</p>
    <p>In Recommender Systems, impressions are a relatively new type of information that records all products previously shown to the users. They are also a complex source of information, combining the effects of the recommender system that generated them, search results, or business rules that may select specific products for recommendations. The fact that the user interacted with a specific item given a list of recommended ones may benefit from a richer interaction signal, in which some items the user did not interact with may be considered negative interactions. This work presents a preliminary evaluation of recommendation models with impressions. First, impressions are characterized by describing their assumptions, signals, and challenges. Then, an evaluation study with impressions is described. The study’s goal is two-fold: to measure the effects of impressions data on properly-tuned recommendation models using current open-source datasets and disentangle the signals within impressions data. Preliminary results suggest that impressions data and signals are nuanced, complex, and effective at improving the recommendation quality of recommenders. This work publishes the source code, datasets, and scripts used in the evaluation to promote reproducibility in the domain.</p>

    <p>As machine learning methods are increasingly used in interactive systems it becomes common for user experiences to be the result of an ecosystem of machine learning models in aggregate. Simulation offers a way to deal with the resulting complexity by approximating the real system in a tractable and interpretable manner. Existing methods do not fully incorporate the interactions between user history, recommendation quality, and subsequent visits. We develop Accordion, a trainable simulator based on Poisson processes that can model visit patterns to an interactive system over time from large-scale data. New methods for training and simulation are developed and tested on two datasets of real world interactive systems. Accordion shows greater sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning and offline A/B testing than comparison methods, an important step in building realistic task-oriented simulators for recommendation.</p>

    <h3>ProtoCF: Prototypical Collaborative Filtering for Few-shot Item Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aravind Sankar, Hari Sundaram, Junting Wang, Adit Krishnan</p>
    <p>In recent times, deep learning methods have supplanted conventional collaborative filtering approaches as the backbone of modern recommender systems. However, their gains are skewed towards popular items with a drastic performance drop for the vast collection of long-tail items with sparse interactions. Moreover, we empirically show that prior neural recommenders lack the resolution power to accurately rank relevant items within the long-tail. In this paper, we formulate long-tail item recommendations as a few-shot learning problem of learning-to-recommend few-shot items with very few interactions. We propose a novel meta-learning framework ProtoCF that learns-to-compose robust prototype representations for few-shot items. ProtoCF utilizes episodic few-shot learning to extract meta-knowledge across a collection of diverse meta-training tasks designed to mimic item ranking within the tail. To further enhance discriminative power, we propose a novel architecture-agnostic technique based on knowledge distillation to extract, relate, and transfer knowledge from neural base recommenders. Our experimental results demonstrate that ProtoCF consistently outperforms state-of-art approaches on overall recommendation (by 5% Recall@50) while achieving significant gains (of 60-80% Recall@50) for tail items with less than 20 interactions.</p>
