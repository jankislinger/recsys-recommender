    <h3>Rs4rs: Semantically Find Recent Publications from Top Recommendation System-Related Venues (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tri Kurniawan Wijaya, Gabor Fodor, Edoardo D’Amico, Manuel V. Loureiro</p>
    <p>Rs4rs is a web application designed to perform semantic search on recent papers from top conferences and journals related to Recommender Systems. Current scholarly search engine tools like Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and ResearchGate often yield broad results that fail to target the most relevant high-quality publications. Moreover, manually visiting individual conference and journal websites is a time-consuming process that primarily supports only syntactic searches. Rs4rs addresses these issues by providing a user-friendly platform where researchers can input their topic of interest and receive a list of recent, relevant papers from top Recommender Systems venues. Utilizing semantic search techniques, Rs4rs ensures that the search results are not only precise and relevant but also comprehensive, capturing papers regardless of<br>variations in wording. This tool significantly enhances research efficiency and accuracy, thereby benefitting the research community and public by facilitating access to high-quality, pertinent academic resources in the field of Recommender Systems. Rs4rs is available at https://rs4rs.com.</p>

    <h3>FineNet: A Joint Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Network Model to Forecast and Recommend Anomalous Financial Items (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Che Tsai, You-Jia Chen, Chih-Yao Chen, Cheng-Te Li, Pei-Chi Wang, Shao-Lun Ma, Yu-Chieh Chang</p>
    <p>Financial technology (FinTech) draws much attention in these years, with the advances of machine learning and deep learning. In this work, given historical time series of stock prices of companies, we aim at forecasting upcoming anomalous financial items, i.e., abrupt soaring or diving stocks, in financial time series, and recommending the corresponding stocks to support financial operations. We propose a novel joint convolutional and recurrent neural network model, Financial Event Neural Network (FineNet), to forecast and recommend anomalous stocks. Experiments conducted on the time series of stock prices of 300 well-known companies exhibit the promising performance of FineNet in terms of precision and recall. We build FineNet as a Web platform for live demonstration.</p>

    <h3>Kibitz: End-to-End Recommendation System Builder (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David R. Karger, Quanquan Liu</p>
    <p>Kibitz (kibitz.csail.mit.edu) is a web application and recommendation system framework that helps inexperienced and novice programmers to build recommenders without the need to program the back end for the system. The author uploads a table of items, and Kibitz produces a collaborative-filtering recommender for the uploaded items. The recommender can be hosted by Kibitz or downloaded and customized as a set of static pages hosted on the author’s personal web domain. Developers who want to avoid the hassle of writing their own recommender back end may choose to link their websites to our service through our easy to use API. A demo of our system can be found at kibitz.csail.mit.edu/video_demo/.</p>
