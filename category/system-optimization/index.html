    <h3>Improving Recommender Systems Through the Automation of Design Decisions (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas Wegmeth</p>
    <p>Recommender systems developers are constantly faced with difficult design decisions. Additionally, the number of options that a recommender systems developer has to consider continually grows over time with new innovations. The machine learning community is in a similar situation and has come together to tackle the problem. They invented concepts and tools to make machine learning development both easier and faster. These developments are categorized as automated machine learning (AutoML). As a result, the AutoML community formed and continuously innovates new approaches. Inspired by AutoML, the recommender systems community has recently understood the need for automation and sparsely introduced AutoRecSys. The goal of AutoRecSys is not to replace recommender systems developers but to improve performance through the automation of design decisions. With AutoRecSys, recommender systems engineers do not have to focus on easy but time-consuming tasks and are free to pursue difficult engineering tasks instead. Additionally, AutoRecSys enables easier access to recommender systems for beginners as it reduces the amount of knowledge required to get started with the development of recommender systems. AutoRecSys, like AutoML, is still early in its development and does not yet cover the whole development pipeline. Additionally, it is not yet clear, under which circumstances AutoML approaches can be transferred to recommender systems. Our research intends to close this gap by improving AutoRecSys both with regard to the transfer of AutoML and novel approaches. Furthermore, we focus specifically on the development of novel automation approaches for data processing and training. We note that the realization of AutoRecSys is going to be a community effort. Our part in this effort is to research AutoRecSys fundamentals, build practical tools for the community, raise awareness of the advantages of automation, and catalyze AutoRecSys development.</p>

    <h3>Jointly Optimize Capacity, Latency and Engagement in Large-scale Recommendation Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hitesh Khandelwal</p>
    <p>As the recommendation systems behind commercial services scale up and apply more and more sophisticated machine learning models, it becomes important to optimize computational cost (capacity) and runtime latency, besides the traditional objective of user engagement. Caching recommended results and reusing them later is a common technique used to reduce capacity and latency. However, the standard caching approach negatively impacts user engagement. To overcome the challenge, this paper presents an approach to optimizing capacity, latency and engagement simultaneously. We propose a smart caching system including a lightweight adjuster model to refresh the cached ranking scores, achieving significant capacity savings without impacting ranking quality. To further optimize latency, we introduce a prefetching strategy which leverages the smart cache. Our production deployment on Facebook Marketplace demonstrates that the approach reduces capacity demand by 50% and p75 end-to-end latency by 35%. While Facebook Marketplace is used as a case study, the approach is applicable to other industrial recommendation systems as well.</p>

    <h3>RecSysOps: Best Practices for Operating a Large-Scale Recommender System (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Saberian</p>
    <p>Ensuring the health of a modern large-scale recommendation system is a very challenging problem. To address this, we need to put in place proper logging, sophisticated exploration policies, develop ML-interpretability tools or even train new ML models to predict/detect issues of the main production model. In this talk, we shine a light on this less-discussed but important area and share some of the best practices, called RecSysOps, that weâ€™ve learned while operating our increasingly complex recommender systems at Netflix. RecSysOps is a set of best practices for identifying issues and gaps as well as diagnosing and resolving them in a large-scale machine-learned recommender system. RecSysOps helped us to 1) reduce production issues and 2) increase recommendation quality by identifying areas of improvement and 3) make it possible to bring new innovations faster to our members by enabling us to spend more of our time on new innovations and less on debugging and firefighting issues.</p>
