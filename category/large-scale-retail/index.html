    <h3>Personalized Category Frequency prediction for Buy It Again recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kunal Ghosh, Rankyung Park, Amit Pande</p>
    <p>Buy It Again (BIA) recommendations are crucial to retailers to help improve user experience and site engagement by suggest- ing items that customers are likely to buy again based on their own repeat purchasing patterns. Most existing BIA studies analyze guestsâ€™ personalized behaviour at item granularity. This finer level of granularity might be appropriate for small businesses or small datasets for search purposes. However, this approach can be infea- sible for big retailers like Amazon, Walmart, or Target which have hundreds of millions of guests and tens of millions of items. For such data sets, it is more practical to have a coarse-grained model that captures customer behaviour at the item category level. In addition, customers commonly explore variants of items within the same categories, e.g., trying different brands or flavors of yogurt. A category-based model may be more appropriate in such scenarios. We propose a recommendation system called a hierarchical PCIC model that consists of a personalized category model (PC model) and a personalized item model within categories (IC model). PC model generates a personalized list of categories that customers are likely to purchase again. IC model ranks items within categories that guests are likely to reconsume within a category. The hierarchical PCIC model captures the general consumption rate of products using survival models. Trends in consumption are captured using time series models. Features derived from these models are used in training a category-grained neural network. We compare PCIC to twelve existing baselines on four standard open datasets. PCIC improves NDCG up to 16% while improving recall by around 2%. We were able to scale and train (over 8 hours) PCIC on a large dataset of 100M guests and 3M items where repeat categories of a guest outnumber repeat items. PCIC was deployed and A/B tested on the site of a major retailer, leading to significant gains in guest engagement.</p>
