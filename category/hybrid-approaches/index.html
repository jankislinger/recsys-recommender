    <h3>Large-scale Recommendation for Portfolio Optimization (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Marcel Edwin Swezey, Bruno Charron</p>
    <p>Individual investors are now massively using online brokers to trade stocks with convenient interfaces and low fees, albeit losing the advice and personalization traditionally provided by full-service brokers. We frame the problem faced by online brokers of replicating this level of service in a low-cost and automated manner for a very large number of users. Because of the care required in recommending financial products, we focus on a risk-management approach tailored to each user’s portfolio and risk profile. We show that our hybrid approach, based on Modern Portfolio Theory and Collaborative Filtering, provides a sound and effective solution. The method is applicable to stocks as well as other financial assets, and can be easily combined with various financial forecasting models. We validate our proposal by comparing it with several baselines in a domain expert-based study.</p>

    <h3>entity2rec: Learning User-Item Relatedness from Knowledge Graphs for Top-N Item Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphaël Troncy, Enrico Palumbo, Giuseppe Rizzo</p>
    <p>Knowledge Graphs have proven to be extremely valuable to recommender systems, as they enable hybrid graph-based recommendation models encompassing both collaborative and content information. Leveraging this wealth of heterogeneous information for top-N item recommendation is a challenging task, as it requires the ability of effectively encoding a diversity of semantic relations and connectivity patterns. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning user-item relatedness from knowledge graphs for top-N item recommendations. We start from a knowledge graph modeling user-item and item-item relations and we learn property-specific vector representations of users and items applying neural language models on the network. These representations are used to create property-specific user-item relatedness features, which are in turn fed into learning to rank algorithms to learn a global relatedness model that optimizes top-N item recommendations. We evaluate the proposed approach in terms of ranking quality on the MovieLens 1M dataset, outperforming two state-of-the-art recommender systems, and we assess the importance of property-specific relatedness scores on the overall ranking quality.</p>

    <h3>Weighted Random Walks for Meta-Path Expansion in Heterogeneous Networks (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fatemeh Vahedian, Bamshad Mobasher, Robin Burke</p>
    <p>In social networks, users and items are joined in a complex web of relations, which can be modeled as heterogeneous information networks. Such networks include a variety of object types and the rich relations among them. Recent research has shown that a hybrid recommendation approach combining components built from extended meta-paths in the network can improve the accuracy of recommendations in such networks. However most of this recent work is focused on unweighted heterogeneous networks, and simplifying relations by ignoring weight (including user ratings) loses important information. We propose a random walk based model to generate meta-paths in weighted heterogeneous network in which the frequency of edge sampling is a function of edge weight, and demonstrate that performance is improved using this method.</p>

    <h3>Adaptation and Evaluation of Recommendations for Short-term Shopping Goals (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Jugovac, Dietmar Jannach, Lukas Lerche</p>
    <p>An essential characteristic in many of e-commerce settings is that website visitors can have very specific short-term shopping goals when they browse the site. Relying solely on long-term user models that are pre-trained on historical data can therefore be insufficient for recommendation. Simple “real-time” recommendation approaches based, e.g., on unpersonalized co-occurrence patterns, on the other hand do not fully exploit the available information about the user’s long-term preference profile. In this work, we aim to explore and quantify the effectiveness of using and combining long-term models and short-term adaptation strategies. We conducted an empirical evaluation based on a novel evaluation design and two real-world datasets. The results indicate that maintaining short-term and profiles of the visitors can lead to significant accuracy increases. At the same time, the experiments show that the choice of the algorithm for learning the long term preferences is particularly important at the beginning of new shopping sessions.</p>
