    <h3>Context-based Entity Recommendation for Knowledge Workers: Establishing a Benchmark on Real-life Data (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahta Bakhshizadeh, Heiko Maus, Andreas Dengel</p>
    <p>In recent decades, recommender systems have undergone significant advancements, particularly in popular domains like movies, music, and product recommendations. Yet, progress has been notably slower in leveraging these systems for personal information management and knowledge assistance. In addition to challenges that complicate the adoption of recommender systems in this domain (such as privacy concerns, heterogeneous recommendation items, and frequent context switching), a significant barrier to progress in this area has been the absence of a standardized benchmark for researchers to evaluate their approaches. In response to this gap, this paper presents a benchmark built upon a publicly available dataset of real-life knowledge work in context (RLKWiC). This benchmark focuses on evaluating context-based entity recommendation, a use case for leveraging recommender systems to support knowledge workers in their daily digital tasks. By providing this benchmark, it is aimed to facilitate and accelerate research efforts in enhancing personal knowledge assistance through recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Ranking Across Different Content Types: The Robust Beauty of Multinomial Blending (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Malte Lichtenberg, Giuseppe Di Benedetto, Matteo Ruffini</p>
    <p>An increasing number of media streaming services have expanded their offerings to include entities of multiple content types. For instance, audio streaming services that started by offering music only, now also offer podcasts, merchandise items, and (music) videos. Ranking items across different content types into a single slate poses a significant challenge for traditional learning-to-rank (LTR) algorithms due to differing feature sets and user engagement patterns for different content types. We explore a simple method, called multinomial blending (MB), which can be used in conjunction with most existing LTR algorithms. We compare MB to a range of baselines not only in terms of ranking quality but also from other industry-relevant perspectives such as interpretability, ease-of-use, and stability in dynamic online-learning environments.</p>

    <h3>Heterogeneous Knowledge Fusion: A Novel Approach for Personalized Recommendation via LLM (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhichao Feng, Wei Lin, Zixiang Ding, Xiang Li, Bin Yin, Yu Qin, Junjie Xie</p>
    <p>The analysis and mining of user heterogeneous behavior are of paramount importance in recommendation systems. However, the conventional approach of incorporating various types of heterogeneous behavior into recommendation models leads to feature sparsity and knowledge fragmentation issues. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for personalized recommendation via Large Language Model (LLM), by extracting and fusing heterogeneous knowledge from user heterogeneous behavior information. In addition, by combining heterogeneous knowledge and recommendation tasks, instruction tuning is performed on LLM for personalized recommendations. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate user heterogeneous behavior and significantly improve recommendation performance.</p>

    <h3>Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning for multi-target Cross-Domain Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tendai Mukande</p>
    <p>This paper discusses the current challenges in modeling real world recommendation scenarios and proposes the development of a unified Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning framework for multi-target Cross-Domain recommendation (HGRL4CDR). A shared graph with user-item interactions from multiple domains is proposed as a way to provide an effective representation learning layer and unify the modelling of various heterogeneous data. A heterogeneous graph transformer network will be integrated to the representation learning model to prioritize the most important neighbours, and the proposed model would be able to capture complex information as well as adapt to dynamic changes in the data using matrix perturbation. Using the real world Amazon Review dataset, experiments would be conducted on multi-target cross domain recommendation.</p>
