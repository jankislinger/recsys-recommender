    <h3>Matrix Factorization Equals Efficient Co-occurrence Representation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farhan Khawar, Nevin L. Zhang</p>
    <p>Matrix factorization is a simple and effective solution to the recommendation problem. It has been extensively employed in the industry and has attracted much attention from the academia. However, it is unclear what the low-dimensional matrices represent. We show that matrix factorization can actually be seen as simultaneously calculating the eigenvectors of the user-user and item-item sample co-occurrence matrices. We then use insights from random matrix theory (RMT) to show that picking the top eigenvectors corresponds to removing sampling noise from user/item co-occurrence matrices. Therefore, the low-dimension matrices represent a reduced noise user and item co-occurrence space. We also analyze the structure of the top eigenvector and show that it corresponds to global effects and removing it results in less popular items being recommended. This increases the diversity of the items recommended without affecting the accuracy.</p>

    <h3>Spectral Collaborative Filtering (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip Yu, Fei Jiang, Chun-Ta Lu, Lei Zheng, Jiawei Zhang</p>
    <p>Despite the popularity of Collaborative Filtering (CF), CF-based methods are haunted by the cold-start problem, which has a significantly negative impact on usersâ€™ experiences with Recommender Systems (RS). In this paper, to overcome the aforementioned drawback, we first formulate the relationships between users and items as a bipartite graph. Then, we propose a new spectral convolution operation directly performing in the spectral domain, where not only the proximity information of a graph but also the connectivity information hidden in the graph are revealed. With the proposed spectral convolution operation, we build a deep recommendation model called Spectral Collaborative Filtering (SpectralCF). Benefiting from the rich information of connectivity existing in the spectral domain, SpectralCF is capable of discovering deep connections between users and items and therefore, alleviates the cold-start problem for CF. To the best of our knowledge, SpectralCF is the first CF-based method directly learning from the spectral domains of user-item bipartite graphs. We apply our method on several standard datasets. It is shown that SpectralCF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models. Code and data are available at https://github.com/anonymous121212/SpectralCF.</p>
