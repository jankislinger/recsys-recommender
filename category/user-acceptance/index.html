    <h3>AnnoMathTeX – a Formula Identifier Annotation Recommender System for STEM Documents (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bela Gipp, Corinna Breitinger, Joeran Beel, Ian Mackerracher, Philipp Scharpf, Moritz Schubotz</p>
    <p>Documents from science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) often contain a large number of mathematical formulae alongside text. Semantic search, recommender, and question answering systems require the occurring formula constants and variables (identifiers) to be disambiguated. We present a first implementation of a recommender system that enables and accelerates formula annotation by displaying the most likely candidates for formula and identifier names from four different sources (arXiv, Wikipedia, Wikidata, or the surrounding text). A first evaluation shows that in total, 78% of the formula identifier name recommendations were accepted by the user as a suitable annotation. Furthermore, document-wide annotation saved the user the annotation of ten times more other identifier occurrences. Our long-term vision is to integrate the annotation recommender into the edit-view of Wikipedia and the online LaTeX editor Overleaf.</p>

    <h3>Providing Explanations for Recommendations in Reciprocal Environments (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sarit Kraus, Akiva Kleinerman, Rosenfeld Ariel</p>
    <p>Automated platforms which support users in finding a mutually beneficial match, such as online dating and job recruitment sites, are becoming increasingly popular. These platforms often include recommender systems that assist users in finding a suitable match. While recommender systems which provide explanations for their recommendations have shown many benefits, explanation methods have yet to be adapted and tested in recommending suitable matches. In this paper, we introduce and extensively evaluate the use of reciprocal explanations– explanations which provide reasoning as to why both parties are expected to benefit from the match. Through an extensive empirical evaluation, in both simulated and real-world dating platforms with 287 human participants, we find that when the acceptance of a recommendation involves a significant cost (e.g., monetary or emotional), reciprocal explanations outperform standard explanation methods which consider the recommendation receiver alone. However, to the contrary of to what one may expect, when the cost of accepting a recommendation is negligible, reciprocal explanations are shown to be less effective than the traditional explanation methods.</p>
