    <h3>Analyzing Accuracy versus Diversity in a Health Recommender System for Physical Activities: a Longitudinal User Study (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luc Martens, Toon De Pessemier, Ine Coppens</p>
    <p>As personalization has great potential to improve mobile health apps, analyzing the effect of different recommender algorithms in the health domain is still in its infancy. As such, this paper investigates whether more accurate recommendations from a content-based recommender or more diverse recommendations from a user-based collaborative filtering recommender will lead to more motivation to move. An eight-week longitudinal between-subject user study is being conducted with an Android app in which participants receive personalized recommendations for physical activities and tips to reduce sedentary behavior. The objective manipulation check confirmed that the group with collaborative filtering received significantly more diverse recommendations. The subjective manipulation check showed that the content-based group assigned more positive feedback for perceived accuracy and star rating to the recommendations they chose and executed. However, perceived diversity and inspiringness was significantly higher in the content-based group, suggesting that users might experience the recommendations differently. Lastly, momentary motivation for the executed activities and tips was significantly higher in the content-based group. As such, the preliminary results of this longitudinal study suggest that more accurate and less diverse recommendations have better effects on motivating users to move more.</p>

    <h3>An Industrial Framework for Personalized Serendipitous Recommendation in E-commerce (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sulong Xu, Anyu Dai, Zhuoye Ding, Linfang Hou, Mian Ma, Luobao Zou, Yanyan Zou, Zongyi Wang, Nan Qiao</p>
    <p>Classical recommendation methods typically face the filter bubble problem where users likely receive recommendations of their familiar items, making them bored and dissatisfied. To alleviate such an issue, this applied paper introduces a novel framework for personalized serendipitous recommendation in an e-commerce platform (i.e., JD.com), which allows to present user unexpected and satisfying items deviating from user’s prior behaviors, considering both accuracy and novelty. To achieve such a goal, it is crucial yet challenging to recognize when a user is willing to receive serendipitous items and how many novel items are expected. To address above two challenges, a two-stage framework is designed. Firstly, a DNN-based scorer is deployed to quantify the novelty degree of a product category based on user behavior history. Then, we resort to a potential outcome framework to decide the optimal timing to recommend a user serendipitous items and the novelty degree of the recommendation. Online A/B test on the e-commerce recommender platform in JD.com demonstrates that our model achieves significant gains on various metrics, 0.54% relative increase of impressive depth, 0.8% of average user click count, 3.23%  and 1.38% of number of novel impressive and clicked items individually.</p>

    <h3>Challenging the Myth of Graph Collaborative Filtering: a Reasoned and Reproducibility-driven Analysis (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Pomo, Eugenio Di Sciascio, Daniele Malitesta, Tommaso Di Noia, Vito Walter Anelli, Alejandro Bellogin</p>
    <p>Among the most successful research directions in recommender systems, there are undoubtedly graph neural network-based models (GNNs). Through the natural modeling of users and items as a bipartite, undirected graph, GNNs have pushed up the performance bar for modern recommenders. Unfortunately, most of the original graph-based works cherry-pick results from previous baseline papers without bothering to check whether the results are valid for the configuration under analysis. Thus, our work stands first and foremost as a work on the replicability of results. We provide a code that succeeds in replicating the results proposed in the articles introducing six of the most popular and recent graph recommendation models (i.e., NGCF, DGCF, LightGCN, SGL, UltraGCN, and GFCF). In our experimental setup, we test these six models on three common benchmarking datasets (i.e., Gowalla, Yelp 2018, and Amazon Book). In addition, to understand how these models perform with respect to traditional models for collaborative filtering, we compare the graph models under analysis with some models that have historically emerged as the best performers in an offline evaluation context. Then, the study is extended on two new datasets (i.e., Allrecipes and BookCrossing) for which no known setup exists in the literature. Since the performance on such datasets is not entirely aligned with the previous benchmarking one, we further analyze the possible impact of specific dataset characteristics on the recommendation accuracy performance. By investigating the information flow to the users from their neighborhoods, the analysis aims to identify for which models these intrinsic features in the dataset structure impact accuracy performance. The code to reproduce the experiments is available at: https://split.to/Graph-Reproducibility.</p>

    <h3>Integrating the ACT-R Framework with Collaborative Filtering for Explainable Sequential Music Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Wallmann, Markus Schedl, Elisabeth Lex, Dominik Kowald, Marta Moscati, Markus Reiter-Haas</p>
    <p>Music listening sessions often consist of sequences including repeating tracks. Modeling such relistening behavior with models of human memory has been proven effective in predicting the next track of a session. However, these models intrinsically lack the capability of recommending novel tracks that the target user has not listened to in the past. Collaborative filtering strategies, on the contrary, provide novel recommendations by leveraging past collective behaviors but are often limited in their ability to provide explanations. To narrow this gap, we propose four hybrid algorithms that integrate collaborative filtering with the cognitive architecture ACT-R. We compare their performance in terms of accuracy, novelty, diversity, and popularity bias, to baselines of different types, including pure ACT-R, kNN-based, and neural-networks-based approaches. We show that the proposed algorithms are able to achieve the best performances in terms of novelty and diversity, and simultaneously achieve a higher accuracy of recommendation with respect to pure ACT-R models. Furthermore, we illustrate how the proposed models can provide explainable recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Negative Preference in Content-based Music Recommendation with Contrastive Learning (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minju Park, Kyogu Lee</p>
    <p>Advanced music recommendation systems are being introduced along with the development of machine learning. However, it is essential to design a music recommendation system that can increase user satisfaction by understanding users’ music tastes, not by the complexity of models. Although several studies related to music recommendation systems exploiting negative preferences have shown performance improvements, there was a lack of explanation on how they led to better recommendations. In this work, we analyze the role of negative preference in users’ music tastes by comparing music recommendation models with contrastive learning exploiting preference (CLEP) but with three different training strategies - exploiting preferences of both positive and negative (CLEP-PN), positive only (CLEP-P), and negative only (CLEP-N). We evaluate the effectiveness of the negative preference by validating each system with a small amount of personalized data obtained via survey and further illuminate the possibility of exploiting negative preference in music recommendations. Our experimental results show that CLEP-N outperforms the other two in accuracy and false positive rate. Furthermore, the proposed training strategies produced a consistent tendency regardless of different types of front-end musical feature extractors, proving the stability of the proposed method.</p>

    <h3>Towards Unified Metrics for Accuracy and Diversity for Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filip Radlinski, Javier Parapar</p>
    <p>Recommender systems evaluation has evolved rapidly in recent years. However, for offline evaluation, accuracy is the de facto standard for assessing the superiority of one method over another, with most research comparisons focused on tasks ranging from rating prediction to ranking metrics for top-n recommendation. Simultaneously, recommendation diversity and novelty have become recognized as critical to users’ perceived utility, with several new metrics recently proposed for evaluating these aspects of recommendation lists. Consequently, the accuracy-diversity dilemma frequently shows up as a choice to make when creating new recommendation algorithms.<br>We propose a novel adaptation of a unified metric, derived from one commonly used for search system evaluation, to Recommender Systems. The proposed metric combines topical diversity and accuracy, and we show it to satisfy a set of desired properties that we formulate axiomatically. These axioms are defined as fundamental constraints that a good unified metric should always satisfy. Moreover, beyond the axiomatic analysis, we present an experimental evaluation of the metric with collaborative filtering data. Our analysis shows that the metric respects the desired theoretical constraints and behaves as expected when performing offline evaluation.</p>

    <h3>Sparse Feature Factorization for Recommender Systems with Knowledge Graphs (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonio Ferrara, Alberto Carlo Maria Mancino, Vito Walter Anelli, Tommaso Di Noia</p>
    <p>Deep Learning and factorization-based collaborative filtering recommendation models have undoubtedly dominated the scene of recommender systems in recent years. However, despite their outstanding performance, these methods require a training time proportional to the size of the embeddings and it further increases when also side information is considered for the computation of the recommendation list. In fact, in these cases we have that with a large number of high-quality features, the resulting models are more complex and difficult to train. This paper addresses this problem by presenting KGFlex: a sparse factorization approach that grants an even greater degree of expressiveness. To achieve this result, KGFlex analyzes the historical data to understand the dimensions the user decisions depend on (e.g., movie direction, musical genre, nationality of book writer). KGFlex represents each item feature as an embedding and it models user-item interactions as a factorized entropy-driven combination of the item attributes relevant to the user. KGFlex facilitates the training process by letting users update only those relevant features on which they base their decisions. In other words, the user-item prediction is mediated by the user’s personal view that considers only relevant features. An extensive experimental evaluation shows the approach’s effectiveness, considering the recommendation results’ accuracy, diversity, and induced bias. The public implementation of KGFlex is available at https://split.to/kgflex.</p>

    <h3>ImRec: Learning Reciprocal Preferences Using Images (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan McConville, James Neve</p>
    <p>Reciprocal Recommender Systems are recommender systems for social platforms that connect people to people. They are commonly used in online dating, social networks and recruitment services. The main difference between these and conventional user-item recommenders that might be found on, for example, a shopping service, is that they must consider the interests of both parties. In this study, we present a novel method of making reciprocal recommendations based on image data. Given a user’s history of positive and negative preference expressions on other users images, we train a siamese network to identify images that fit a user’s personal preferences. We provide an algorithm to interpret those individual preference indicators into a single reciprocal preference relation. Our evaluation was performed on a large real-world dataset provided by a popular online dating service. Based on this, our service significantly improves on previous state-of-the-art content-based solutions, and also out-performs collaborative filtering solutions in cold-start situations. The success of this model provides empirical evidence for the high importance of images in online dating.</p>

    <h3>Quality-Aware Neural Complementary Item Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Caverlee, Wei Niu, Haokai Lu, Yin Zhang</p>
    <p>Complementary item recommendation finds products that go well with one another (e.g., a camera and a specific lens). While they are ubiquitous, the dimensions by which items go together can vary by both product and category, making it difficult to detect complementary items at scale. Moreover, in practice, user preferences for complementary items can be complex combinations of item quality and evidence of complementarity. Hence, we propose a new neural complementary recommender Encore that can jointly learn complementary item relationships and user preferences. Specifically, Encore (i) effectively combines and balances both stylistic and functional evidence of complementary items across item categories; (ii) naturally models item latent quality for complementary items through Bayesian inference of customer ratings; and (iii) builds a novel neural network model to learn the complex (non-linear) relationships between items for flexible and scalable complementary product recommendations. Through experiments over large Amazon datasets, we find that Encore effectively learns complementary item relationships, leading to an improvement in accuracy of 15.5% on average versus the next-best alternative.</p>

    <h3>The Magic Barrier Revisited: Accessing Natural Limitations of Recommender Assessment (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergej Sizov, Kevin Jasberg</p>
    <p>Recommender systems nowadays have many applications and are of great economic benefit. Hence, it is imperative for a success-oriented company to compare different of such systems and select the better one from them. For this purpose, various metrics of predictive accuracy are commonly used, such as the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), or precision and recall, just to name a few of them. All these metrics more or less measure how well a recommender system can predict human behaviour. Unfortunately, human behaviour is always associated with some degree of uncertainty, making the evaluation of recommender systems difficult, since it is not clear whether a deviation is system-induced or just originates from the natural variability of human decision making. At this point, some Authors speculated that we may be reaching some magic barrier where this variability may prevent us from getting much more accurate. In this article, we will extend the existing theory of the Magic Barrier into a new probabilistic but yet pragmatic model. In particular, we will use methods from metrology and physics to develop easy-to-handle quantities for computation to describe the Magic Barrier for different accuracy metrics and provide suggestions for common application. This discussion is substantiated by comprehensive experiments with real users and large-scale simulations on a high performance cluster.</p>

    <h3>Accuracy and Diversity in Cross-domain Recommendations for Cold-start Users with Positive-only Feedback (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tommaso Di Noia, Eugenio Di Sciascio, Paolo Tomeo, Ignacio Fernández-Tobías, Iván Cantador</p>
    <p>Computing useful recommendations for cold-start users is a major challenge in the design of recommender systems, and additional data is often required to compensate the scarcity of user feedback. In this paper we address such problem in a target domain by exploiting user preferences from a related auxiliary domain. Following a rigorous methodology for cold-start, we evaluate a number of recommendation methods on a dataset with positive-only feedback in the movie and music domains, both in single and cross-domain scenarios. Comparing the methods in terms of item ranking accuracy, diversity and catalog coverage, we show that cross-domain preference data is useful to provide more accurate suggestions when user feedback in the target domain is scarce or not available at all, and may lead to more diverse recommendations depending on the target domain. Moreover, evaluating the impact of the user profile size and diversity in the source domain, we show that, in general, the quality of target recommendations increases with the size of the profile, but may deteriorate with too diverse profiles.</p>

    <h3>Addressing Cold Start for Next-song Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Hsuan Yang, Jyh-Shing Roger Jang, Szu-Yu Chou, Yu-Ching Lin</p>
    <p>The cold start problem arises in various recommendation applications. In this paper, we propose a tensor factorization-based algorithm that exploits content features extracted from music audio to deal with the cold start problem for the emerging application next-song recommendation. Specifically, the new algorithm learns sequential behavior to predict the next song that a user would be interested in based on the last song the user just listened to. A unique characteristic of the algorithm is that it learns and updates the mapping between the audio feature space and the item latent space each time during the iterations of the factorization process. This way, the content features can be better exploited in forming the latent features for both users and items, leading to more effective solutions for cold-start recommendation. Evaluation on a large-scale music recommendation dataset shows that the recommendation result of the proposed algorithm exhibits not only higher accuracy but also better novelty and diversity, suggesting its applicability in helping a user explore new items in next-item recommendation.

    <h3>Weighted Random Walks for Meta-Path Expansion in Heterogeneous Networks (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fatemeh Vahedian, Bamshad Mobasher, Robin Burke</p>
    <p>In social networks, users and items are joined in a complex web of relations, which can be modeled as heterogeneous information networks. Such networks include a variety of object types and the rich relations among them. Recent research has shown that a hybrid recommendation approach combining components built from extended meta-paths in the network can improve the accuracy of recommendations in such networks. However most of this recent work is focused on unweighted heterogeneous networks, and simplifying relations by ignoring weight (including user ratings) loses important information. We propose a random walk based model to generate meta-paths in weighted heterogeneous network in which the frequency of edge sampling is a function of edge weight, and demonstrate that performance is improved using this method.</p>

    <h3>Adapting Recommendations to Contextual Changes Using Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehdi Hosseinzadeh Aghdam, Negar Hariri, Bamshad Mobasher, Robin Burke</p>
    <p>Recommender systems help users find items of interest by tailoring their recommendations to users’ personal preferences. The utility of an item for a user, however, may vary greatly depending on that user’s specific situation or the context in which the item is used. Without considering these changes in preferences, the recommendations may match the general preferences of a user, but they may have small value for the user in his/her current situation. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical hidden Markov model for capturing changes in user’s preferences. Using a user’s feedback sequence on items, we model the user as a hierarchical hidden Markov process and the current context of the user as a hidden variable in this model. For a given user, our model is used to infer the maximum likelihood sequence of transitions between contextual states and to predict the probability distribution for the context of the next action. The predicted context is then used to generate recommendations. Our evaluation results using Last.fm music playlist data, indicate that this approach achieves significantly better performance in terms of accuracy and diversity compared to baseline methods.</p>

    <h3>Using Graded Implicit Feedback for Bayesian Personalized Ranking (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Lukas Lerche</p>
    <p>In many application domains of recommender systems, explicit rating information is sparse or non-existent. The preferences of the current user have therefore to be approximated by interpreting his or her behavior, i.e., the implicit user feedback. In the literature, a number of algorithm proposals have been made that rely solely on such implicit feedback, among them Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR). In the BPR approach, pairwise comparisons between the items are made in the training phase and an item i is considered to be preferred over item j if the user interacted in some form with i but not with j. In real-world applications, however, implicit feedback is not necessarily limited to such binary decisions as there are, e.g., different types of user actions like item views, cart or purchase actions and there can exist several actions for an item over time. In this paper we show how BPR can be extended to deal with such more fine-granular, graded preference relations. An empirical analysis shows that this extension can help to measurably increase the predictive accuracy of BPR on realistic e-commerce datasets.</p>
