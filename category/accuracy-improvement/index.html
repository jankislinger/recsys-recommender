    <h3>Predicting User Routines with Masked Dilated Convolutions (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dragomir Yankov, Senthil Palanisamy, Renzhong Wang, Wei Wu, Siddhartha Arora, Michael R. Evans</p>
    <p>Predicting users daily location visits – when and where they will go, and how long they will stay – is key for making effective location-based recommendations. Knowledge of an upcoming day allows the suggestion of relevant alternatives (e.g., a new coffee shop on the way to work) in advance, prior to a visit. This helps users make informed decisions and plan accordingly. People’s visit routines, or just routines, can vary significantly from day to day, and visits from earlier in the day, week, or month may affect subsequent choices. Traditionally, routine prediction has been modeled with sequence methods, such as HMMs or more recently with RNN-based architectures. However, the problem with such architectures is that their predictive performance degrades when increasing the number of historical observations in the routine sequence. In this paper, we propose Masked-TCN (MTCN), a novel method based on time-dilated convolutional networks. The method implements custom dilations and masking which can process effectively long routine sequences, identifying recurring patterns at different resolution – hourly, daily, weekly, monthly. We demonstrate that MTCN achieves 8% improvement in accuracy over current state-of-the-art solutions on a large data set of visit routines. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Field-aware Probabilistic Embedding Neural Network for CTR Prediction (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Jinkai, Huifeng Guo, Xiuqiang He, Jiajin Li, Shengyu Zhang, Weiwen Liu, Ruiming Tang</p>
    <p>For Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, Field-aware Factorization Machines (FFM) have exhibited great effectiveness by considering field information. However, it is also observed that FFM suffers from the overfitting problem in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Field-aware Probabilistic Embedding Neural Network (FPENN) model with both good generalization ability and high accuracy. FPENN estimates the probability distribution of the field-aware embedding rather than using the single point estimation (the maximum a posteriori estimation) to prevent overfitting. Both low-order and high-order feature interactions are considered to improve the accuracy. FPENN consists of three components, i.e., FPE component, Quadratic component and Deep component. FPE component outputs probabilistic embedding to the other two components, where various confidence levels for feature embeddings are incorporated to enhance the robustness and the accuracy. Quadratic component is designed for extracting low-order feature interactions, while Deep component aims at capturing high-order feature interactions. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, Avazu and Criteo. The results confirm that our model alleviates the overfitting problem while has a higher accuracy.</p>

    <h3>The Importance of Song Context in Music Playlists (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Massimo Quadrana, Andreu Vall, Gerhard Widmer, Markus Schedl, Paolo Cremonesi</p>
    <p>Music recommender systems often operate in sequential mode by suggesting a collection of songs that constitute a listening session. This task is usually called automated music playlist generation and it has been previously studied in the literature with different successful approaches based on, e.g., variations of collaborative filtering or content-based similarity. Some of the proposed playlist models take into consideration the current song and a number of previous songs, i.e., the song context , in order to predict the next song. However, it is not yet clear to what extent knowing this song context improves next-song predictions. To shed light on this question, we conduct a numerical experiment on two datasets of hand-curated music playlists, where we compare playlist models that account for different song context lengths. Our results indicate that knowing the song context seems, at first, uninformative. However, we explain this effect by a strong bias in the data towards very popular songs and observe that, in fact, songs in the long tail are more accurately predicted when the song context is considered.</p>

    <h3>Sequential User-based Recurrent Neural Network Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jürgen Ziegler, Tim Donkers, Benedikt Loepp</p>
    <p>Recurrent Neural Networks are powerful tools for modeling sequences. They are flexibly extensible and can incorporate various kinds of information including temporal order. These properties make them well suited for generating sequential recommendations. In this paper, we extend Recurrent Neural Networks by considering unique characteristics of the Recommender Systems domain. One of these characteristics is the explicit notion of the user recommendations are specifically generated for. We show how individual users can be represented in addition to sequences of consumed items in a new type of Gated Recurrent Unit to effectively produce personalized next item recommendations. Offline experiments on two real-world datasets indicate that our extensions clearly improve objective performance when compared to state-of-the-art recommender algorithms and to a conventional Recurrent Neural Network.</p>

    <h3>Gaze Prediction for Recommender Systems (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qian Zhao, F. Maxwell Harper, Shuo Chang, Joseph A. Konstan</p>
    <p>As users browse a recommender system, they systematically consider or skip over much of the displayed content. It seems obvious that these eye gaze patterns contain a rich signal concerning these users’ preferences. However, because eye tracking data is not available to most recommender systems, these signals are not widely incorporated into personalization models. In this work, we show that it is possible to predict gaze by combining easily-collected user browsing data with eye tracking data from a small number of users in a grid-based recommender interface. Our technique is able to leverage a small amount of eye tracking data to infer gaze patterns for other users. We evaluate our prediction models in MovieLens — an online movie recommender system. Our results show that incorporating eye tracking data from a small number of users significantly boosts accuracy as compared with only using browsing data, even though the eye-tracked users are different from the testing users (e.g. AUC=0.823 vs. 0.693 in predicting whether a user will fixate on an item). We also demonstrate that Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) can be applied in this setting; they are better than linear models in predicting fixation probability and capturing the interface regularity through Bayesian inference (AUC=0.823 vs. 0.757).</p>

    <h3>Adaptation and Evaluation of Recommendations for Short-term Shopping Goals (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Jugovac, Dietmar Jannach, Lukas Lerche</p>
    <p>An essential characteristic in many of e-commerce settings is that website visitors can have very specific short-term shopping goals when they browse the site. Relying solely on long-term user models that are pre-trained on historical data can therefore be insufficient for recommendation. Simple “real-time” recommendation approaches based, e.g., on unpersonalized co-occurrence patterns, on the other hand do not fully exploit the available information about the user’s long-term preference profile. In this work, we aim to explore and quantify the effectiveness of using and combining long-term models and short-term adaptation strategies. We conducted an empirical evaluation based on a novel evaluation design and two real-world datasets. The results indicate that maintaining short-term and profiles of the visitors can lead to significant accuracy increases. At the same time, the experiments show that the choice of the algorithm for learning the long term preferences is particularly important at the beginning of new shopping sessions.</p>

    <h3>Overlapping Community Regularization for Rating Prediction in Social Recommender Systems (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dingming Wu, Nikos Mamoulis, Wenbin Tang, Hui Li</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have become de facto tools for suggesting items that are of potential interest to users. Predicting a user’s rating on an item is the fundamental recommendation task. Traditional methods that generate predictions by analyzing the user-item rating matrix perform poorly when the matrix is sparse. Recent approaches use data from social networks to improve accuracy. However, most of the social-network based recommender systems only consider direct friendships and they are less effective when the targeted user has few social connections. In this paper, we propose two alternative models that incorporate the overlapping community regularization into the matrix factorization framework. Our empirical study on four real datasets shows that our approaches outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in both traditional and social-network based recommender systems regarding both cold-start users and normal users.</p>
