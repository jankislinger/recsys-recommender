    <h3>Uncovering User Interest from Biased and Noised Watch Time in Video Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Xu, Guohao Cai, Zhenhua Dong, Haiyuan Zhao, Lei Zhang, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
    <p>In micro-video recommendation scenarios, watch time is commonly adopted as an indicator of users’ interest. However, watch time is not only determined by the matching of users’ interests but is affected by other factors. These factors mainly lie in two folds: on the one hand, users tend to spend more time on those charming videos with the growth of the duration (i.e., video length), named as duration bias; on the other hand, it costs people a period of time to judge whether they like the video, named as noisy watching. Consequently, the existence of duration bias and noisy watching make watch time an inadequate label for training a reliable recommendation model. Moreover, current methods focus only on the duration bias and ignore the duration noise, so they do not really uncover the user interest from watch time. In this study, we first analyze the generation mechanism of users’ watch time in a unified causal viewpoint. Unlike current methods, which only notice the duration bias in watch time, we considered the watch time as a mixture of the user’s actual interest, the duration biased watch time, and the noisy watch time. To mitigate both the duration bias and noisy watching, we propose Debiased and Denoised watch time Correction (D$^2$Co), which can be divided into two steps: First, we employ a duration-wise Gaussian Mixture Model plus frequency-weighted moving average for estimating the bias and noise terms; Then we utilize a sensitivity-controlled correction function to separate the user interest from the watch time, which is robust to the estimation error of bias and noise terms. The experiments on two public video recommendation datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

    <h3>Using Learnable Physics for Real-Time Exercise Form Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gautam Chauhan, Abhishek Jaiswal, Nisheeth Srivastava</p>
    <p>Good posture and form are essential for safe and productive exercising. Even in gym settings, trainers may not be readily available for feedback. Rehabilitation therapies and fitness workouts can thus benefit from recommender systems that provide real-time evaluation. In this paper, we present an algorithmic pipeline that can diagnose problems in exercises technique and offer corrective recommendations, with high sensitivity and specificity, in real-time. We use MediaPipe for pose recognition, count repetitions using peak-prominence detection, and use a learnable physics simulator to track motion evolution for each exercise. A test video is diagnosed based on deviations from the prototypical learned motion using statistical learning. The system is evaluated on six full and upper body exercises. These real-time interactive suggestions counseled via low-cost equipment like smartphones will allow exercisers to rectify potential mistakes making self-practice feasible while reducing the risk of workout injuries.</p>
