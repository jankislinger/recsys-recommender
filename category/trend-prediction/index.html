    <h3>Trending Now: Modeling Trend Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anoop Deoras, Venkataramana Kini, Hao Wang, Yupeng Gu, Fei Wang, Youngsuk Park, Ravi Divvela, Yifei Ma, Branislav Kveton, Hao Ding</p>
    <p>Modern recommender systems usually include separate recommendation carousels such as ‘trending now’ to list trending items and further boost their popularity, thereby attracting active users. Though widely useful, such ‘trending now‘ carousels typically generate item lists based on simple heuristics, e.g., the number of interactions within a time interval, and therefore still leave much room for improvement. This paper aims to systematically study this under-explored but important problem from the new perspective of time series forecasting. We first provide a set of rigorous definitions related to item trendiness with associated evaluation protocols, and then propose a deep latent variable model, dubbed Trend Recommender (TrendRec), to forecast items’ future trend and generate trending item lists. Experiments on real-world datasets from various domains show that our TrendRec significantly outperforms the baselines, verifying our model’s effectiveness.</p>

    <h3>Behavior-based Popularity Ranking on Amazon Video (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lakshmi Ramachandran</p>
    <p>With the growth in the number of video streaming services, providers have to strive hard to make relevant content available and keep customers engaged. A good experience would help customers discover new and popular videos to stream with ease. Customer streaming behavior tends to be a strong indicator of whether they found a video engaging. Aggregate customer behavior serves as a useful predictor of popularity. We discuss the use of past streaming behavior to learn patterns and predict a video’s popularity using tree ensembles.</p>

    <h3>MoocRec.com: Massive Open Online Courses Recommender System (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Panagiotis Symeonidis, Dimitrios Malakoudis</p>
    <p>Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have recently gained a huge users’ attention on the Web. They are considered as a highly promising form of teaching from leading universities such as Stanford and Berkeley. MoocRec.com is a web site that recommends courses to users so that, they can acquire those skills, that are expected from their ideal job posting. MoocRec’s recommendation engine is based on Matrix Factorization (MF) model combined with Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithm, which exploits information from external resources (i.e., users’ skills, courses’ characteristics, etc.) to predict course trends and to perform rating predictions according to them.</p>
