    <h3>Causal Embeddings for Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flavian Vaslie, Stephen Bonner</p>
    <p>Many current applications use recommendations in order to modify the natural user behavior, such as to increase the number of sales or the time spent on a website. This results in a gap between the final recommendation objective and the classical setup where recommendation candidates are evaluated by their coherence with past user behavior, by predicting either the missing entries in the user-item matrix, or the most likely next event. To bridge this gap, we optimize a recommendation policy for the task of increasing the desired outcome versus the organic user behavior. We show this is equivalent to learning to predict recommendation outcomes under a fully random recommendation policy. To this end, we propose a new domain adaptation algorithm that learns from logged data containing outcomes from a biased recommendation policy and predicts recommendation outcomes according to random exposure. We compare our method against state-of-the-art factorization methods and new approaches of causal recommendation and show significant improvements.</p>

    <h3>Representation Learning for Homophilic Preferences (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hady W. Lauw, Trong T. Nguyen</p>
    <p>Users express their personal preferences through ratings, adoptions, and other consumption behaviors. We seek to learn latent representations for user preferences from such behavioral data. One representation learning model that has been shown to be effective for large preference datasets is Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). While homophily, or the tendency of friends to share their preferences at some level, is an established notion in sociology, thus far it has not yet been clearly demonstrated on RBM-based preference models. The question lies in how to appropriately incorporate social network into the architecture of RBM-based models for learning representations of preferences. In this paper, we propose two potential architectures: one that models social network among users as additional observations, and another that incorporates social network into the sharing of hidden units among related users. We study the efficacies of these proposed architectures on publicly available, real-life preference datasets with social networks, yielding useful insights.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation with the Right Slice: Speeding Up Collaborative Filtering with Factorization Machines (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Babak Loni, Alan Hanjalic, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Martha Larson</p>
    <p>We propose an alternative way to efficiently exploit rating data for collaborative filtering with Factorization Machines (FMs). Our approach partitions user-item matrix into ‘slices’ which are mutually exclusive with respect to items. The training phase makes direct use of the slice of interest ( slice), while incorporating information from other slices indirectly. FMs represent user-item interactions as feature vectors, and they offer the advantage of easy incorporation of complementary information. We exploit this advantage to integrate information from other slices. We demonstrate, using experiments on two benchmark datasets, that improved performance can be achieved, while the time complexity of training can be reduced significantly.</p>
