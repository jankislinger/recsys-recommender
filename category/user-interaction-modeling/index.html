    <h3>Sequential Recommendation Models: A Graph-based Perspective (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Peintner</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RecSys) traditionally leverage the usersâ€™ rich interaction data with the system, but ignore the sequential dependency of items. Sequential recommender systems aim to predict the next item the user will interact with (e.g., click on, purchase, or listen to) based on the preceding interactions of the user. Current state-of-the-art approaches focus on transformer-based architectures and graph neural networks. Specifically, the modeling of sequences as graphs has shown to be a promising approach to introduce a structured bias into the recommendation learning framework. In this work, we will outline our research of exploring different applications of graphs in sequential recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Large-scale Interactive Conversational Recommendation System (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Allan, Ali Montazeralghaem, Philip S. Thomas</p>
    <p>We propose AC-CRS, a novel conversational recommendation system based on reinforcement learning that better models user interaction compared to prior work. Interactive recommender systems expect an initial request from a user and then iterate by asking questions or recommending potential matching items, continuing until some stopping criterion is achieved. Unlike most existing works that stop as soon as an item is recommended, we model the more realistic expectation that the interaction will continue if the item is not appropriate. Using this process, AC-CRS is able to support a more flexible conversation with users. Unlike existing models, AC-CRS is able to estimate a value for each question in the conversation to make sure that questions asked by the agent are relevant to the target item (i.e., user needs). We also model the possibility that the system could suggest more than one item in a given turn, allowing it to take advantage of screen space if it is present. AC-CRS also better accommodates the massive space of items that a real-world recommender system must handle. Experiments on real-world user purchasing data show the effectiveness of our model in terms of standard evaluation measures such as NDCG.</p>

    <h3>From Preference into Decision Making: Modeling User Interactions in Recommender Systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gediminas Adomavicius, Qian Zhao, Martijn C. Willemsen, F. Maxwell Harper, Joseph A. Konstan</p>
    <p>User-system interaction in recommender systems involves three aspects: temporal browsing (viewing recommendation lists and/or searching/filtering), action (performing actions on recommended items, e.g., clicking, consuming) and inaction (neglecting or skipping recommended items). Modern recommenders build machine learning models from recordings of such user interaction with the system, and in doing so they commonly make certain assumptions (e.g., pairwise preference orders, independent or competitive probabilistic choices, etc.). In this paper, we set out to study the effects of these assumptions along three dimensions in eight different single models and three associated hybrid models on a user browsing data set collected from a real-world recommender system application. We further design a novel model based on recurrent neural networks and multi-task learning, inspired by Decision Field Theory, a model of human decision making. We report on precision, recall, and MAP, finding that this new model outperforms the others.</p>
