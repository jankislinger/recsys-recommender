    <h3>Why the Shooting in the Dark Method Dominates Recommender Systems Practice (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Rohde</p>
    <p>The introduction of A/B Testing represented a great leap forward in recommender systems research. Like the randomized control trial for evaluating drug efficacy; A/B Testing has equipped recommender systems practitioners with a protocol for measuring performance as defined by actual business metrics and with minimal assumptions. While A/B testing provided a way to measure the performance of two or more candidate systems, it provides no guide for determining what policy we should test. The focus of this industry talk is to better understand, why the development of A/B testing was the last great leap forward in the development of reward optimizing recommender systems despite more than a decade of efforts in both industry and academia. The talk will survey: industry best practice, standard theories and tools including: collaborative filtering (MovieLens RecSys), contextual bandits, attribution, off-policy estimation, causal inference, click through rate models and will explain why we have converged on a fundamentally heuristic solution or guess and check type method. The talk will offer opinions about which of these theories are useful, and which are not and make a concrete proposal to make progress based on a non-standard use of deep learning tools.</p>

    <h3>RecSysOps: Best Practices for Operating a Large-Scale Recommender System (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Saberian</p>
    <p>Ensuring the health of a modern large-scale recommendation system is a very challenging problem. To address this, we need to put in place proper logging, sophisticated exploration policies, develop ML-interpretability tools or even train new ML models to predict/detect issues of the main production model. In this talk, we shine a light on this less-discussed but important area and share some of the best practices, called RecSysOps, that we’ve learned while operating our increasingly complex recommender systems at Netflix. RecSysOps is a set of best practices for identifying issues and gaps as well as diagnosing and resolving them in a large-scale machine-learned recommender system. RecSysOps helped us to 1) reduce production issues and 2) increase recommendation quality by identifying areas of improvement and 3) make it possible to bring new innovations faster to our members by enabling us to spend more of our time on new innovations and less on debugging and firefighting issues.</p>

    <h3>Challenges Experienced in Public Service Media Recommendation Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Grün</p>
    <p>After multiple years of successfully applying recommendation algorithms at ZDF, a German Public Service Media provider, we have faced certain challenges in regards to the optimization of our systems and the resulting recommendations. The design and the optimization of our systems are guided by various, partially competing objectives and are, therefore, influenced by various factors. Similarly to commercial video on demand services, ZDF is interested in binding its audience by providing personalized recommendations in its streaming media service. However, more importantly, as a Public Service Media provider, we are committed to offer diverse, universal, unbiased, and transparent recommendations while following established editorial guidelines and strict privacy regulations. Additionally, we are committed to provide environmentally-friendly or green recommendations optimizing our systems for run time and power consumption. With the intent to start a public discussion, we describe the challenges that arise when optimizing Public Service Media recommendation systems towards machine learning metrics, business Key Performance Indicators, Public Service Media values, and run-time simultaneously, while aiming to keep the results transparent.</p>
