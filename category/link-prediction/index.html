    <h3>Cold Start Similar Artists Ranking with Gravity-Inspired Graph Autoencoders (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Romain Hennequin, Benjamin Chapus, Guillaume Salha-Galvan, Michalis Vazirgiannis, Viet-Anh Tran</p>
    <p>On an artist’s profile page, music streaming services frequently recommend a ranked list of ”similar artists” that fans also liked. However, implementing such a feature is challenging for new artists, for which usage data on the service (e.g. streams or likes) is not yet available. In this paper, we model this cold start similar artists ranking problem as a link prediction task in a directed and attributed graph, connecting artists to their top-k most similar neighbors and incorporating side musical information. Then, we leverage a graph autoencoder architecture to learn node embedding representations from this graph, and to automatically rank the top-k most similar neighbors of new artists using a gravity-inspired mechanism. We empirically show the flexibility and the effectiveness of our framework, by addressing a real-world cold start similar artists ranking problem on a global music streaming service. Along with this paper, we also publicly release our source code and the industrial data from our experiments.</p>

    <h3>Compositional Network Embedding for Link Prediction (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Jiang, Wenwu Ou, Tianshu Lyu, Fei Sun, Yan Zhang</p>
    <p>Network embedding has proved extremely useful in a variety of network analysis tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and network visualization. Almost all the existing network embedding methods learn to map the node IDs to their corresponding node embeddings. This design principle, however, hinders the existing methods from being applied in real cases. Node ID is not generalizable and, thus, the existing methods have to pay great effort in cold-start problem. The heterogeneous network usually requires extra work to encode node types, as node type is not able to be identified by node ID. Node ID carries rare information, resulting in the criticism that the existing methods are not robust to noise. To address this issue, we introduce Compositional Network Embedding, a general inductive network representation learning framework that generates node embeddings by combining node features based on the ‘principle of compositionally’. Instead of directly optimizing an embedding lookup based on arbitrary node IDs, we learn a composition function that infers node embeddings by combining the corresponding node attribute embeddings through a graph-based loss. For evaluation, we conduct the experiments on link prediction under four different settings. The results verified the effectiveness and generalization ability of compositional network embeddings, especially on unseen nodes. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Chemical Reactant Recommendation using a Network of Organic Chemistry (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ernesto Diaz-Aviles, Carlos Alzate, Akihiro Kishimoto, John Savage, Beat Buesser</p>
    <p>This paper presents recommendation algorithms for novel applications in chemistry. We focus on the task of recommending to the chemist candidate molecules (reactants) necessary to synthesize a given target molecule (product), which is an important step for the chemist to find a synthesis route to generate the product. We formulate this task as a link-prediction problem over a so-called Network of Organic Chemistry (NOC) that we have constructed from 8 million chemical reactions described in the US patent literature between 1976 and 2013. We leverage state-of-the-art factorization algorithms for recommender systems to solve this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Factorization Machines, trained with chemistry-specific knowledge, outperforms current methods based on similarity of chemical structures.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Sentiment Homophily for Link Prediction (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Munindar Singh, Pradeep Murukannaiah, Guangchao Yuan, Zhe Zhang</p>
    <p>Link prediction system has been extensively studied and adopted to recommendation systems on social media. With the increasing popularity of sentiment analysis on social network, knowing the relationship between users’ sentiments and link prediction is important. In this paper, we study how to exploit sentiment homophily in link prediction. We have gathered political campaign dataset of one-month on Twitter. We define a set of sentiment-based features that quantify the likelihood of two users becoming friends based on their sentiments toward topics. Our evaluation in a supervised learning framework demonstrates the benefits of sentiment-based features in link prediction. Further, Adamic-Adar and Euclidean distance based measures are the best predictors. We propose a factor graph model that incorporates the sentiment-based cognitive balance theory. Our evaluation shows how our model offers help in link prediction on different kinds of graphs, compared to traditional machine learning techniques. Our work offers new insights for real-world link recommendation systems.</p>
