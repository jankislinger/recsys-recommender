    <h3>Democratizing Urban Mobility Through an Open-Source, Multi-Criteria Route Recommendation System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Eggerth, Javier Argota Sánchez-Vaquerizo, Sachit Mahajan, Dirk Helbing</p>
    <p>Urban navigation systems traditionally optimize for efficiency, thereby overlooking environmental factors and personal preferences. This paper introduces Routify, a novel multi-criteria recommender system for personalized urban route selection. Routify advances the state-of-the-art in route recommendation through: (1) integration of diverse environmental data (air quality, noise levels, green spaces) with real-time IoT inputs; (2) a dynamic weighting algorithm allowing fine-grained user control over routing parameters; (3) transparent decision-making via an interactive interface displaying edge-level information; and (4) a community-driven feedback mechanism that continuously refines recommendations. We have implemented Routify as an open-source platform, facilitating further research and development. Experimental results from 1000 origin-destination pairs demonstrate significant improvements in user-defined environmental metrics (up to 32.98% increase in green index for walking and 16.91% reduction in noise levels for cycling) compared to traditional routing systems. These improvements come with slight trade-offs in distance, especially in walking mode. Our research contributes a comprehensive framework for multi-criteria route recommendation, balancing individual preferences, environmental factors, and community insights in urban navigation.</p>

    <h3>ComfRide: A Smartphone based System for Comfortable Public Transport Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surjya Ghosh, Niloy Ganguly, Sandip Chakraborty, Bivas Mitra, Rohit Verma, Saketh Mahankali</p>
    <p>Passenger comfort is a major factor influencing a commuter’s decision to avail public transport. Existing studies suggest that factors like overcrowding, jerkiness, traffic congestion etc. correlate well to passenger’s (dis)comfort. An online survey conducted with more than 300 participants from 12 different countries reveals that different personalized and context dependent factors influence passenger comfort during a travel by public transport. Leveraging on these findings, we identify correlations between comfort level and these dynamic parameters, and implement a smartphone based application, ComfRide, which recommends the most comfortable route based on user’s preference honoring her travel time constraint. We use a ‘Dynamic Input/Output Automata’ based composition model to capture both the wide varieties of comfort choices from the commuters and the impact of environment on the comfort parameters. Evaluation of ComfRide, involving 50 participants over 28 routes in a state capital of India, reveals that recommended routes have on average 30% better comfort level than Google map recommended routes, when a commuter gives priority to specific comfort parameters of her choice.</p>

    <h3>Crowd Sourcing, with a Few Answers: Recommending Commuters for Traffic Updates (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Berlingerio, François Schnitzler, Elizabeth M. Daly</p>
    <p>Real-time traffic awareness applications are playing an ever increasing role understanding and tackling traffic congestion in cities. First-hand accounts from drivers witnessing an incident is an invaluable source of information for traffic managers. Nowadays, drivers increasingly contact control rooms through social media to report on journey times, accidents or road weather conditions. These new interactions allow traffic controllers to engage users, and in particular to query them for information rather than passively collecting it. Querying articipants presents the challenge of which users to probe for updates about a specific situation. In order to maximise the probability of a user responding and the accuracy of the information, we propose a strategy which takes into account the engagement levels of the user, the mobility profile and the reputation of the user. We provide an analysis of a real-world user corpus of Twitter users contributing updates to LiveDrive, a Dublin based traffic radio station.</p>
