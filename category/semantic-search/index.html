    <h3>Rs4rs: Semantically Find Recent Publications from Top Recommendation System-Related Venues (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tri Kurniawan Wijaya, Gabor Fodor, Edoardo D’Amico, Manuel V. Loureiro</p>
    <p>Rs4rs is a web application designed to perform semantic search on recent papers from top conferences and journals related to Recommender Systems. Current scholarly search engine tools like Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and ResearchGate often yield broad results that fail to target the most relevant high-quality publications. Moreover, manually visiting individual conference and journal websites is a time-consuming process that primarily supports only syntactic searches. Rs4rs addresses these issues by providing a user-friendly platform where researchers can input their topic of interest and receive a list of recent, relevant papers from top Recommender Systems venues. Utilizing semantic search techniques, Rs4rs ensures that the search results are not only precise and relevant but also comprehensive, capturing papers regardless of<br>variations in wording. This tool significantly enhances research efficiency and accuracy, thereby benefitting the research community and public by facilitating access to high-quality, pertinent academic resources in the field of Recommender Systems. Rs4rs is available at https://rs4rs.com.</p>

    <h3>Re2Dan: Retrieval of medical documents for e-Health in Danish (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafael Pablos, Ira Assent, Antonela Tommasel</p>
    <p>With the clinical environment becoming more data-reliant, healthcare professionals now have unparalleled access to comprehensive clinical information from numerous sources. Then, one of the main issues is how to avoid overloading practitioners with large amounts of (irrelevant) information while guiding them to the relevant documents for specific patient cases. Additional challenges appear due to the shortness of queries and the presence of long (and maybe noisy) contextual information. This demo presents Re2Dan, a web Retrieval and recommender of Danish medical documents. Re2Dan leverages several techniques to improve the quality of retrieved documents. First, it combines lexical and semantic searches to understand the meaning and context of user queries, allowing the retrieval of documents that are conceptually similar to the user’s query. Second, it recommends similar queries, allowing users to discover related documents and insights. Third, when given contextual information (e.g., from patients’ clinical notes), it suggests medical concepts to expand the user query, enabling a more focused search scope and thus obtaining more accurate recommendations. Preliminary analyses showed the effectiveness of the recommender in improving the relevance and comprehensiveness of recommendations, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in finding relevant information for informed decision-making.</p>

    <h3>AnnoMathTeX – a Formula Identifier Annotation Recommender System for STEM Documents (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bela Gipp, Corinna Breitinger, Joeran Beel, Ian Mackerracher, Philipp Scharpf, Moritz Schubotz</p>
    <p>Documents from science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) often contain a large number of mathematical formulae alongside text. Semantic search, recommender, and question answering systems require the occurring formula constants and variables (identifiers) to be disambiguated. We present a first implementation of a recommender system that enables and accelerates formula annotation by displaying the most likely candidates for formula and identifier names from four different sources (arXiv, Wikipedia, Wikidata, or the surrounding text). A first evaluation shows that in total, 78% of the formula identifier name recommendations were accepted by the user as a suitable annotation. Furthermore, document-wide annotation saved the user the annotation of ten times more other identifier occurrences. Our long-term vision is to integrate the annotation recommender into the edit-view of Wikipedia and the online LaTeX editor Overleaf.</p>
