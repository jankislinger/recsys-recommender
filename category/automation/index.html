    <h3>Playlist Search Reinvented: LLMs Behind the Curtain (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tarun Sharma, Siddharth Sharma, Geetha Aluri, Joaquin Delgado</p>
    <p>Improving search functionality poses challenges such as data scarcity for model training, metadata enrichment for comprehensive document indexing, and the labor-intensive manual annotation for evaluation. Traditionally, iterative methods relying on human annotators and customer feedback have been used. However, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new solutions. This paper focuses on applying LLMs to playlist search in Amazon Music. Leveraging LLMsâ€™ contextual understanding and generative capabilities automates metadata enrichment, reducing manual efforts and expediting training. LLMs also address data scarcity by generating synthetic training data and serve as scalable judges for evaluation, enhancing search performance assessment. We demonstrate how these innovations enhance playlist search, overcoming traditional limitations to improve search result accuracy and relevance.</p>

    <h3>Improving Recommender Systems Through the Automation of Design Decisions (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas Wegmeth</p>
    <p>Recommender systems developers are constantly faced with difficult design decisions. Additionally, the number of options that a recommender systems developer has to consider continually grows over time with new innovations. The machine learning community is in a similar situation and has come together to tackle the problem. They invented concepts and tools to make machine learning development both easier and faster. These developments are categorized as automated machine learning (AutoML). As a result, the AutoML community formed and continuously innovates new approaches. Inspired by AutoML, the recommender systems community has recently understood the need for automation and sparsely introduced AutoRecSys. The goal of AutoRecSys is not to replace recommender systems developers but to improve performance through the automation of design decisions. With AutoRecSys, recommender systems engineers do not have to focus on easy but time-consuming tasks and are free to pursue difficult engineering tasks instead. Additionally, AutoRecSys enables easier access to recommender systems for beginners as it reduces the amount of knowledge required to get started with the development of recommender systems. AutoRecSys, like AutoML, is still early in its development and does not yet cover the whole development pipeline. Additionally, it is not yet clear, under which circumstances AutoML approaches can be transferred to recommender systems. Our research intends to close this gap by improving AutoRecSys both with regard to the transfer of AutoML and novel approaches. Furthermore, we focus specifically on the development of novel automation approaches for data processing and training. We note that the realization of AutoRecSys is going to be a community effort. Our part in this effort is to research AutoRecSys fundamentals, build practical tools for the community, raise awareness of the advantages of automation, and catalyze AutoRecSys development.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation Systems for Ad Creation: A View from the Trenches (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manisha Verma, Shaunak Mishra</p>
    <p>Creative design is one of the key components of generating engaging content on the web. E-commerce websites need engaging product descriptions, social networks require user posts to have different types of content such as videos, images and hashtags, and traditional media formats such as blogs require content creators to constantly innovate their writing style, and choice of content they publish to engage with their intended audience. Designing the right content, irrespective of the industry, is a time consuming task, often requires several iterations of content selection and modification. Advertising is one such industry where content is the key to capture user interest and generate revenue. Designing engaging and attention grabbing advertisements requires extensive domain knowledge and market trend awareness. This motivates companies to hire marketing specialists to design specific advertising content, most often tasked to create text, image or video advertisements. This process is tedious and iterative which limits the amount of content that can be produced manually. In this talk, we summarize our work focused on automating ad creative design by leveraging state of the art approaches in text mining, ranking, generation, multimodal (visual-linguistic) representations, multilingual text understanding, and recommendation. We discuss how such approaches can help to reduce the time spent on designing ads, and showcase their impact on real world advertising systems and metrics.</p>

    <h3>Automating Recommender Systems Experimentation with librec-auto (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Burke, Xavier Sepulveda, Masoud Mansoury, Aldo Ordonez-Gauger</p>
    <p>Recommender systems research often requires the creation and execution of large numbers of algorithmic experiments to determine the sensitivity of results to the values of various hyperparameters. Existing recommender systems platforms fail to provide a basis for systematic experimentation of this type. In this paper, we describe librec-auto, a wrapper for the well-known LibRec library, which provides an environment that supports automated experimentation.</p>

    <h3>Pokedem: an Automatic Social Media Management Application (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Giuliano, Francesco Corcoglioniti, Yaroslav Nechaev, Roberto Zanoli</p>
    <p>Typically, the task of managing the social media presence of a company or a public person is the job of a dedicated social media account manager. While many attempts have been made in recent years to provide more automation to account managers, complete workflow automation has still to be achieved. Pokedem is a social media management application that aims at filling this gap, recommending actions that could be performed by the account manager to increase the popularity of a Twitter account and the engagement of its audience. By casting the problem in the setting of recommendation systems, Pokedem is able to provide account managers with a complete tool for automating their daily activities.</p>
