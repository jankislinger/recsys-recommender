    <h3>Building and Deploying a Multi-Stage Recommender System with Merlin (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Even Oldridge, Ronay Ak, Gabriel de Souza Pereira Moreira, Sara Rabhi, Karl Higley</p>
    <p>Newcomers to recommender systems often face challenges related to their lack of understanding of how these systems operate in real life. In most online content related to this topic, the focus is on models and algorithms that score items based on the user’s preferences. However, the recommender model alone does not comprise everything needed for serving optimized recommender systems that meet the company’s business objectives. An industry-standard recommender system involves a number of steps, including data preprocessing, defining and training recommender models, as well as filtering and business logic for serving. In this work, we propose the four-stage recommender system, an industry-wide design pattern we have identified for production recommender systems. The four-stage pipeline includes an item retrieval step that prepares a small subset of relevant items for scoring. The filtering stage then cleans up the subset of items based on business logic such as removing out-of-stock or previously seen items. As for the ranking component, it uses a recommender model to score each item in the presented list based on the preferences of the user. In the final step, the scores are re-ordered to provide a final recommendation list aligned with other business needs or constraints such as diversity. In particular, the presented demo demonstrates how easy it is to build and deploy a four-stage recommender system pipeline using the NVIDIA Merlin open-source framework.</p>

    <h3>Reducing Energy Waste in Households Through Real-Time Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iraklis Varlamis, Akshay Anil Pagar, Janhavi Dahihande, Ajinkya Thakare, Magdalini Eirinaki, Akshay Anil Jaiswal</p>
    <p>The energy consumption of households has steadily increased over the last couple of decades. Research suggests that user behavior is the most influential factor in the energy waste of a household. Thus, there’s a need for helping consumers change their behavior to make it more energy efficient and environment friendly. In this work we propose a real-time recommender system that assists consumers in improving their household’s energy usage. By monitoring the power demand of each appliance in the household, the system detects the device status (on/off) at any moment, and using pattern mining creates a household profile comprising energy consumption patterns for different periods of the day. An intuitive UI allows users to set energy consumption goals and preferences on the appliances they’d like to save energy from. Based on the household profile, the user’s preferences and the actual power demand the system generates personalized real-time recommendations on which appliances should be turned off at a moment. We employ the UK-DALE (UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity) dataset to model and evaluate the entire process, from data preprocessing and transformation of the appliance power demand input to various pattern mining algorithms used to generate appliance usage profiles and recommendations, showing that even small changes in appliance usage behavior can lead to energy savings between 2-17%.</p>

    <h3>BETA-Rec: Build, Evaluate and Tune Automated Recommender Systems (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iadh Ounis, Yaxiong Wu, Shangsong Liang, Zaiqiao Meng, Craig Macdonald, Guangtao Zeng, Richard McCreadie, Siwei Liu, Yucheng Liang, Qiang Zhang, Junhua Liang</p>
    <p>The field of recommender systems has rapidly evolved over the last few years, with significant advances made due to the in-flux of deep learning techniques. However, as a result of this rapid progress, escalating barriers-to-entry for new researchers is emerging. In particular, state-of-the-art approaches have fragmented into a large number of code-bases, often requiring different input formats, pre-processing stages and evaluating with different metric packages. Hence, it is time-consuming for new researchers to reach the point of having both an effective baseline set and a sound comparative environment. As a step towards elevating this problem, we have developed BETA-Rec, an open source project for Building, Evaluating and Tuning Automated Recommender Systems. BETA-Rec aims to provide a practical data toolkit for building end-to-end recommendation systems in a standardized way. It provides means for dataset preparation and splitting using common strategies, a generalized model engine for implementing recommender models using Pytorch with 9 models available out-of-the-box, as well as a unified training, validation, tuning and testing pipeline. Furthermore, BETA-Rec is designed to be both modular and extensible, enabling new models to be quickly added to the framework. It is deployable in a wide range of environments via pre-built docker containers and supports distributed parameter tuning using Ray. In this demo, we will illustrate the deployment and use of BETA-Rec for researchers and practitioners on a number of standard recommendation datasets. The source code of the project is available at github: https://github.com/beta-team/beta-recsys.</p>
