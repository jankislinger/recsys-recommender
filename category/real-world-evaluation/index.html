    <h3>Explainable and Faithful Educational Recommendations through Causal Language Modelling via Knowledge Graphs (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neda Afreen</p>
    <p>The rapid expansion of digital education has significantly increased the need for recommender systems to help learners navigate the extensive variety of available learning resources. Recent advancements in these systems have notably improved the personalization of course recommendations. However, many existing systems fail to provide clear explanations for their recommendations, making it difficult for learners to understand why a particular suggestion was made. This lack of transparency can negatively impact trust and acceptance of the system. Researchers have emphasized the importance of explanations in various other domains such as ecommerce, media, and entertainment, demonstrating how explanations can enhance system transparency, foster user trust, and improve decision-making processes. Despite these insights, such approaches have been rarely applied to the educational domain, and their effectiveness in practical use remains largely unexamined. My research focuses on developing explainable recommender systems for digital education. First, I aim to design knowledge graphs that can support high-quality recommendations in the context of education. Second, I will create models backed by these knowledge graphs that not only deliver accurate recommendations but also provide faithful explanations for each suggestion, helping learners make informed decisions. Third, I will evaluate the effectiveness of these explainable recommender systems in real-world scenarios.</p>
