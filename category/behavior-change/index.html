    <h3>Balancing Habit Repetition and New Activity Exploration: A Longitudinal Micro-Randomized Trial in Physical Activity Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ine Coppens, Luc Martens, Toon De Pessemier</p>
    <p>As repetition of activities can establish habits and exploration of new ones can provide a healthy variety, we investigate how a recommender system for physical activities can optimally balance these two approaches. We conducted an eight-week user study with 62 physically inactive participants who receive personalized repetition and exploration recommendations in a random order. We distinguish between location, workout, and general activities, and collect participants’ subjective perceptions. Our findings indicate that participants initially preferred exploring general activities, but rated repeating recommendations higher after two weeks. By exploring the optimal transition point from exploration to repetition in personalized recommendations, this study contributes to designing more effective recommender systems for health improvement and healthy habit formation.</p>

    <h3>Behaviorism is Not Enough (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martijn C Willemsen, Michael D Ekstrand</p>
    <p>Behaviorism is the currently-dominant paradigm for building and evaluating recommender systems. Both the operation and the evaluation of recommender system applications are most often driven by analyzing the behavior of users. In this paper, we argue that listening to what users say — about the items and recom-mendations they like, the control they wish to exert on the output, and the ways in which they perceive the system — and not just observing what they do will enable important developments in the future of recommender systems. We provide both philosophi-cal and pragmatic motivations for this idea, describe the various points in the recommendation and evaluation processes where explicit user input may be considered, and discuss benefits that may result from considered incorporation of user preferences at each of these points. In particular, we envision recommender applications that aim to support users’ better selves: helping them live the life that they desire to lead. For example, recommender-assisted behavior change requires algorithms to predict not what users choose or do now, inferable from behavioral data, but what they should choose or do in the future to become healthier, fitter, more sustainable, or culturally aware. We hope that our work will spur useful discussion and many new ideas for recommenders that empower their users.</p>

    <h3>Nudging Grocery Shoppers to Make Healthier Choices (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elizabeth Wayman, Sriganesh Madhvanath</p>
    <p>Despite the rampant increase in obesity rates and concomitant increases in rates of mortality from heart disease, cancer and diabetes, getting the general public to adopt a healthy diet has proven to be challenging for a variety of reasons. In this paper, we describe Foodle, a research project aimed at providing automated, personalized and goal-driven dietary guidance to users based on their grocery receipt data, by leveraging the availability of digital receipts for grocery store purchases. We discuss challenges faced, the current state of the project, and directions for future work.</p>

    <h3>PERSPeCT: Collaborative Filtering for Tailored Health Communications (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rebecca Kinney, Thomas Houston, Benjamin Marlin, Roy Adams, Rajani Sadasivam, Kavitha Balakrishnan</p>
    <p>The goal of computer tailored health communications (CTHC) is to elicit healthy behavior changes by sending motivational messages personalized to individual patients. One prominent weakness of many existing CTHC systems is that they are based on expert-written rules and thus have no ability to learn from their users over time. One solution to this problem is to develop CTHC systems based on the principles of collaborative filtering, but this approach has not been widely studied. In this paper, we present a case study evaluating nine rating prediction methods for use in the Patient Experience Recommender System for Persuasive Communication Tailoring, a system developed for use in a clinical trial of CTHC-based smoking cessation support interventions.</p>
