    <h3>Observing Group Decision Making Processes (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laurens Rook, Markus Zanker, Hannes Werthner, Julia Neidhardt, Francesco Ricci, Amra Delic, Thuy Ngoc Nguyen</p>
    <p>Most research on group recommender systems relies on the assumption that individuals have conflicting preferences; in order to generate group recommendations the system should identify a fair way of aggregating these preferences. Both empirical studies and theoretical frameworks have tried to identify the most effective preference aggregation techniques without coming to definite conclusions. In this paper, we propose to approach group recommendation from the group dynamics perspective and analyze the group decision making process for a particular task (in the travel domain). We observe several individual and group properties and correlate them to choice satisfaction. Supported by these initial results we therefore advocate for the development of new group recommendation techniques that consider group dynamics and support the full group decision making process.</p>

    <h3>Improving the User Experience during Cold Start through Choice-Based Preference Elicitation (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark P. Graus, Martijn C. Willemsen</p>
    <p>We studied an alternative choice-based interface for preference elicitation during the cold start phase and compared it directly with a standard rating-based interface. In this alternative interface users started from a diverse set covering all movies and iteratively narrowed down through a matrix factorization latent feature space to smaller sets of items based on their choices. The results show that compared to a rating-based interface, the choice-based interface requires less effort and results in more satisfying recommendations, showing that it might be a promising candidate for alleviating the cold start problem of new users.</p>

    <h3>User Perception of Differences in Movie Recommendation Algorithms (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martijn Willemsen, F. Maxwell Harper, Michael Ekstrand, Joseph Konstan</p>
    <p>Recent developments in user evaluation of recommender systems have brought forth powerful new tools for understanding what makes recommendations effective and useful. We apply these methods to understand how users evaluate recommendation lists for the purpose of selecting an algorithm for finding movies. This paper reports on an experiment in which we asked users to compare lists produced by three common collaborative filtering algorithms on the dimensions of novelty, diversity, accuracy, satisfaction, and degree of personalization, and to select a recommender that they would like to use in the future. We find that satisfaction is negatively dependent on novelty and positively dependent on diversity in this setting, and that satisfaction predicts the user’s final selection. We also compare users’ subjective perceptions of recommendation properties with objective measures of those same characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first study that applies modern survey design and analysis techniques to a within-subjects, direct comparison study of recommender algorithms.</p>
