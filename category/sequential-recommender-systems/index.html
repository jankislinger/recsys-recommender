    <h3>Integrating Item Relevance in Training Loss for Sequential Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Bacciu, Federico Siciliano, Fabrizio Silvestri, Nicola Tonellotto</p>
    <p>Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) are a popular type of recommender system that leverages user history to predict the next item of interest. However, the presence of noise in user interactions, stemming from account sharing, inconsistent preferences, or accidental clicks, can significantly impact the robustness and performance of SRSs, particularly when the entire item set to be predicted is noisy. This situation is more prevalent when only one item is used to train and evaluate the SRSs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach that addresses the issue of noise in SRSs. First, we propose a sequential multi-relevant future items training objective, leveraging a loss function aware of item relevance, thereby enhancing their robustness against noise in the training data. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of noise at evaluation time, we propose multi-relevant future items evaluation (MRFI-evaluation), aiming to improve overall performance. Our relevance-aware models obtain an improvement of ~1.58\% of NDCG@10 and 0.96\% in terms of HR@10 in the traditional evaluation protocol, the one which utilizes one relevant future item. In the MRFI-evaluation protocol, using multiple future items, the improvement is ~2.82\% of NDCG@10 and ~0.64\% of HR@10 w.r.t the best baseline model.</p>

    <h3>Climbing crags repetitive choices and recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iustina Ivanova</p>
    <p>Outdoor sport climbing in Northern Italy attracts climbers from around the world. While this country has many rock formations, it offers enormous possibilities for adventurous people to explore the mountains. Unfortunately, this great potential causes a problem in finding suitable destinations (crags) to visit for climbing activity. Existing recommender systems in this domain address this issue and suggest potentially interesting items to climbers utilizing a content-based approach. These systems understand users’ preferences from their past logs recorded in an electronic training diary. At the same time, some sports people have a behavioral tendency to revisit the same place for subjective reasons. It might be related to weather and seasonality (for instance, some crags are suitable for climbing in winter/summer only), the users’ preferences (when climbers like specific destinations more than others), or personal goals to be achieved in sport (when climbers plan to try some routes again). Unfortunately, current climbing crags recommendations do not adapt when users demonstrate these repetitive behavior patterns. Sequential recommender systems can capture such users’ habits since their architectures were designed to model users’ next item choice by learning from their previous decision manners. To understand to which extent these sequential recommendations can predict the following crags choices in sport climbing, we analyzed a scenario when climbers show repetitious decisions. Further, we present a data set from collected climbers’ e-logs in the Arco region (Italy) and applied several sequential recommender systems architectures for predicting climbers’ following crags’ visits from their past logs. We evaluated these recommender systems offline and compared ranking metrics with the other reported results on the different data sets. The work concludes that sequential models obtain comparably accurate results as in the other studies and have the prospect for climbers’ subsequent visit prediction and crags recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Don’t recommend the obvious: estimate probability ratios (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenjie Zhao, Roberto Pellegrini, Iain Murray</p>
    <p>Sequential recommender systems are becoming widespread in the online retail and streaming industry. These systems are often trained to predict the next item given a sequence of a user’s recent actions, and standard evaluation metrics reward systems that can identify the most probable items that might appear next. However, some recent papers instead evaluate recommendation systems with popularity-sampled metrics, which measure how well the model can find a user’s next item when hidden amongst generally-popular items. We argue that these popularity-sampled metrics are more appropriate for recommender systems, because the most probable items for a user often include generally-popular items. If the probability that a customer will watch Toy Story is not much more probable than for the average customer, then the movie isn’t especially relevant for them and we should not recommend it. This paper shows that optimizing popularity-sampled metrics is closely related to estimating point-wise mutual information (PMI). We propose and compare two techniques to fit PMI directly, which both improve popularity-sampled metrics for state-of-the-art recommender systems. The improvements are large compared to differences between recently-proposed model architectures.</p>
