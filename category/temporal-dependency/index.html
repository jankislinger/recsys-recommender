    <h3>RPAF: A Reinforcement Prediction-Allocation Framework for Cache Allocation in Large-Scale Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiqiao Zhan, Kun Gai, Xiaoshuang Chen, Yao Wang, Ziqiang Zhang, Ben Wang, Yulin Wu, Shuo Su</p>
    <p>Modern recommender systems are built upon computation-intensive infrastructure, and it is challenging to perform real-time computation for each request, especially in peak periods, due to the limited computational resources. Recommending by user-wise result caches is widely used when the system cannot afford a real-time recommendation. However, it is challenging to allocate real-time and cached recommendations to maximize the users’ overall engagement. This paper shows two key challenges to cache allocation, i.e., the temporal dependency and the streaming allocation. Then, we propose a reinforcement prediction-allocation framework (RPAF) to address these issues. RPAF is a reinforcement-learning-based two-stage framework containing prediction and allocation stages. The prediction stage estimates the values of the cache choices considering the strategy and value dependencies, while the allocation stage determines the cache choices for each request. We show that the challenge of training RPAF includes globality and the strictness of budget constraints, and a relaxed local allocator (RLA) is proposed to address this issue. Moreover, a PoolRank algorithm is used in the allocation stage to deal with the streaming allocation problem. Experiments show that RPAF significantly improves users’ engagement under computational budget constraints.</p>

    <h3>CAEN: A Hierarchically Attentive Evolution Network for Item-Attribute-Change-Aware Recommendation in the Growing E-commerce Environment (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingsong Yuan, Rui Ma, Jiandong Zhang, Huafeng Yang, Ning Liu</p>
    <p>Traditional recommendation systems mainly focus on modeling user interests. However, the dynamics of recommended items caused by attribute modifications (e.g. changes in prices) are also of great importance in real systems, especially in the fast-growing e-commerce environment, which may cause the users’ demands to emerge, shift and disappear. Recent studies that make efforts on dynamic item representations treat the item attributes as side information but ignore its temporal dependency, or model the item evolution with a sequence of related users but do not consider item attributes. In this paper, we propose Core Attribute Evolution Network (CAEN), which partitions the user sequence according to the attribute value and thus models the item evolution over attribute dynamics with these users. Under this framework, we further devise a hierarchical attention mechanism that applies attribute-aware attention for user aggregation under each attribute, as well as personalized attention for activating similar users in assessing the matching degree between target user and item. Results from the extensive experiments over actual e-commerce datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-art methods and achieves significant improvements on the items with rapid changes over attributes, therefore helping the item recommendation to adapt to the growth of the e-commerce platform.</p>
