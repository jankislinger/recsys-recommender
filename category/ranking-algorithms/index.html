    <h3>The Fault in Our Recommendations: On the Perils of Optimizing the Measurable (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshit Kumar, Yash Kanoria, Omar Besbes</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems play a pivotal role on digital platforms by curating content, products and services for users. These systems are widespread, and through customized recommendations, promise to match users with options they will like. To that end,  data on engagement is collected and used, with, e.g., measurements of clicks, but also  purchases or consumption times.   Most recommendation systems are ranking-based, where they rank and recommend items based on their predicted engagement.  However, the engagement signals  are often only a crude proxy for user utility, as data on the latter is rarely collected or available. This paper explores the following critical research question: By optimizing for measurable proxies, are recommendation systems at risk of significantly under-delivering on user utility? If that is indeed the case, how can one improve utility which is seldom measured? To study these questions, we introduce a model of repeated user consumption in which, at each interaction, users select between an outside option and the best option from a recommendation set. Our model accounts for user heterogeneity, with the majority preferring “popular” content, and a minority favoring “niche” content. The system initially lacks knowledge of individual user preferences but can learn these preferences through observations of users’ choices over time. Our theoretical and numerical analysis demonstrate that optimizing for engagement signals can lead to significant utility losses. Instead, we propose a utility-aware policy that initially recommends a mix of popular and niche content. We show that such a policy substantially improves  utility despite not measuring it. In fact, in the limit of a forward-looking platform with discount factor $\delta \to 1$, our utility-aware policy achieves the best of both worlds: near-optimal user utility and near-optimal engagement simultaneously. Our study elucidates  an important feature of recommendation systems; given the ability to suggest multiple items, one can perform significant exploration without incurring significant reductions in short term engagement. By recommending high-risk, high-reward items alongside popular items, systems can enhance discovery of high utility items without significantly affecting engagement.</p>

    <h3>Analyzing User Preferences and Quality Improvement on Bing’s WebPage Recommendation Experience with Large Language Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jialin Liu, Gang Luo, Hongzhi Li, Chuck Wang, Fan Wu, Amey Barapatre, Jaidev Shah</p>
    <p>Explore Further @ Bing (Web Recommendations) is a web-scale query independent webpage-to-webpage recommendation system with an index size of over 200 billion webpages. Due to the significant variability in webpage quality across the web and the reliance of our system on learning soleley user behavior (clicks), our production system was susceptible to serving clickbait and low-quality recommendations. Our team invested several months in developing and shipping several improvements that utilize LLM-generated recommendation quality labels to enhance our ranking stack to improve the nature of the recommendations we show to our users. Another key motivation behind our efforts was to go beyond merely surfacing relevant webpages, focusing instead on prioritizing more useful and authoritative content that delivers value to users based on their implied intent. We demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) offer a powerful tool for product teams to gain deeper insights into shifts in product experience and user behavior following significant improvements or changes to a production system. In this work, to enable our analysis, we also showcase the use of a small language model (SLM) to generate better-quality webpage text features and summaries at scale and describe our approach to mitigating position bias in user interaction logs.</p>

    <h3>Scale-Invariant Learning-to-Rank (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ye-Sheen Lim, Alessio Petrozziello, Xiaoke Liu, Christian Sommeregger</p>
    <p>At Expedia, learning-to-rank (LTR) models plays a key role on our website in sorting and presenting information more relevant to users, such as search filters, property rooms, amenities, and images. A major challenge in deploying these models is ensuring consistent feature scaling between training and production data, as discrepancies can lead to unreliable rankings when deployed. Normalization techniques like feature standardization and batch normalization could address these issues but are impractical in production due to latency impacts and the difficulty of distributed real-time inference. To address consistent feature scaling issue, we introduce a scale-invariant LTR framework which combines a deep and a wide neural network to mathematically guarantee scale-invariance in the model at both training and prediction time.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation Systems for Ad Creation: A View from the Trenches (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manisha Verma, Shaunak Mishra</p>
    <p>Creative design is one of the key components of generating engaging content on the web. E-commerce websites need engaging product descriptions, social networks require user posts to have different types of content such as videos, images and hashtags, and traditional media formats such as blogs require content creators to constantly innovate their writing style, and choice of content they publish to engage with their intended audience. Designing the right content, irrespective of the industry, is a time consuming task, often requires several iterations of content selection and modification. Advertising is one such industry where content is the key to capture user interest and generate revenue. Designing engaging and attention grabbing advertisements requires extensive domain knowledge and market trend awareness. This motivates companies to hire marketing specialists to design specific advertising content, most often tasked to create text, image or video advertisements. This process is tedious and iterative which limits the amount of content that can be produced manually. In this talk, we summarize our work focused on automating ad creative design by leveraging state of the art approaches in text mining, ranking, generation, multimodal (visual-linguistic) representations, multilingual text understanding, and recommendation. We discuss how such approaches can help to reduce the time spent on designing ads, and showcase their impact on real world advertising systems and metrics.</p>
