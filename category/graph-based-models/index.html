    <h3>Sequential Recommendation Models: A Graph-based Perspective (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Peintner</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RecSys) traditionally leverage the users’ rich interaction data with the system, but ignore the sequential dependency of items. Sequential recommender systems aim to predict the next item the user will interact with (e.g., click on, purchase, or listen to) based on the preceding interactions of the user. Current state-of-the-art approaches focus on transformer-based architectures and graph neural networks. Specifically, the modeling of sequences as graphs has shown to be a promising approach to introduce a structured bias into the recommendation learning framework. In this work, we will outline our research of exploring different applications of graphs in sequential recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Global-Local Item Embedding for Temporal Set Prediction (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiun Kim, Minkyu Kim, Young-Jin Park, Jisu Jeong, Seungjae Jung, Hanock Kwak, Kyung-Min Kim</p>
    <p>Temporal set prediction is becoming increasingly important as many companies employ recommender systems in their online businesses, e.g., personalized purchase prediction of shopping baskets. While most previous techniques have focused on leveraging a user’s history, the study of combining it with others’ histories remains untapped potential. This paper proposes Global-Local Item Embedding (GLOIE) that learns to utilize the temporal properties of sets across whole users as well as within a user by coining the names as global and local information to distinguish the two temporal patterns. GLOIE uses Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and dynamic graph-based model to capture global and local information and then applies attention to integrate resulting item embeddings. Additionally, we propose to use Tweedie output for the decoder of VAE as it can easily model zero-inflated and long-tailed distribution, which is more suitable for several real-world data distributions than Gaussian or multinomial counterparts. When evaluated on three public benchmarks, our algorithm consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in most ranking metrics.</p>

    <h3>A Novel Graph-based Model for Hybrid Recommendations in Cold-start Scenarios (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesare Bernardis, Paolo Cremonesi, Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema</p>
    <p>Cold-start is a very common and still open problem in the Recommender Systems literature. Since cold start items do not have any interaction, collaborative algorithms are not applicable. One of the main strategies is to use pure or hybrid content-based approaches, which usually yield to lower recommendation quality than collaborative ones. Some techniques to optimize performance of this type of approaches have been studied in recent past. One of them is called feature weighting, which assigns to every feature a real value, called weight, that estimates its importance. Statistical techniques for feature weighting commonly used in Information Retrieval, like TF-IDF, have been adapted for Recommender Systems, but they often do not provide sufficient quality improvements. More recent approaches, FBSM and LFW, estimate weights by leveraging collaborative information via machine learning, in order to learn the importance of a feature based on other users opinions. This type of models have shown promising results compared to classic statistical analyzes cited previously. We propose a novel graph, feature-based machine learning model to face the cold-start item scenario, learning the relevance of features from probabilities of item-based collaborative filtering algorithms.</p>

    <h3>HOP-Rec: High-Order Proximity for Implicit Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming-Feng Tsai, Chuan-Ju Wang, Jheng-Hong Yang, Chih-Ming Chen</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are vital ingredients for many e-commerce services. In the literature, two of the most popular approaches are based on factorization and graph-based models; the former approach captures user preferences by factorizing the observed direct interactions between users and items, and the latter extracts indirect preferences from the graphs constructed by user-item interactions. In this paper we present HOP-Rec, a unified and efficient method that incorporates the two approaches. The proposed method involves random surfing on a graph to harvest high-order information among neighborhood items for each user. Instead of factorizing a transition matrix, our method introduces a confidence weighting parameter to simulate all high-order information simultaneously, for which we maintain a sparse user-item interaction matrix and enrich the matrix for each user using random walks. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art on a range of large-scale real-world datasets.</p>
