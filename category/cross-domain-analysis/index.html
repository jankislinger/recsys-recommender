    <h3>Negative-Aware Collaborative Filtering (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Neng Chuang, Chuan-Ju Wang, Ming-Feng Tsai, Sheng-Fang Yang, Sheng-Chieh Lin</p>
    <p>Most traditional recommender systems regard unseen user-item associations as negative user preferences and optimize recommendation models mainly based on observed associations and some negative instances sampled from unseen associations. However, such unseen user-item associations may contain potential positive user preferences on items and are not uniformly distributed in terms of the possibility of being negative (or positive) user preference; therefore, it is essential to quantify such associations for model training. Along this line, in this paper, in contrast to existing recommendation models, which equally treat all unseen associations as negative samples, we present a negative-aware recommendation approach that explicitly models the likelihood of each unseen association being a potentially positive preference. Empirical results on real-world datasets in different fields show that our approach consistently improves recommendation performance.</p>

    <h3>Exploring the Value of Personality in Predicting Rating Behaviors: A Study of Category Preferences on MovieLens (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph A. Konstan, Raghav Pavan Karumur, Tien T. Nguyen</p>
    <p>Prior work relevant to incorporating personality into recommender systems falls into two categories: social science studies and algorithmic ones. Social science studies of preference have found only small relationships between personality and category preferences, whereas, algorithmic approaches found a little improvement when incorporating personality into recommendations. As a result, despite good reasons to believe personality assessments should be useful in recommenders, we are left with no substantial demonstrated impact. In this work, we start with user data from a live recommender system, but study category-by-category variations in preference (both rating levels and distribution) across different personality types. By doing this, we hope to isolate specific areas where personality is most likely to provide value in recommender systems, while also modeling an analytic process that can be used in other domains. After controlling for the family-wise error rate, we find that High Agreeableness users rate at least 0.5 stars higher on a 5-star scale compared to low Agreeableness users. We also find differences in consumption in four different personality types between people who manifested high and low levels of that personality.</p>

    <h3>Are Real-World Place Recommender Algorithms Useful in Virtual World Environments? (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christoph Trattner, Denis Parra, Leandro Balby Marinho</p>
    <p>Large scale virtual worlds such as massive multiplayer online games or 3D worlds gained tremendous popularity over the past few years. With the large and ever increasing amount of content available, virtual world users face the information overload problem. To tackle this issue, game-designers usually deploy recommendation services with the aim of making the virtual world a more joyful environment to be connected at. In this context, we present in this paper the results of a project that aims at understanding the mobility patterns of virtual world users in order to derive place recommenders for helping them to explore content more efficiently. Our study focus on the virtual world SecondLife, one of the largest and most prominent in recent years. Since SecondLife is comparable to real-world Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs), i.e., users can both check-in and share visited virtual places, a natural approach is to assume that place recommenders that are known to work well on real-world LBSNs will also work well on SecondLife. We have put this assumption to the test and found out that (i) while collaborative filtering algorithms have compatible performances in both environments, (ii) existing place recommenders based on geographic metadata are not useful in SecondLife.</p>
