    <h3>Uncovering ChatGPT’s Capabilities in Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihua Si, Chen Xu, Haiyuan Zhao, Xiao Zhang, Weijie Yu, Zhongxiang Sun, Jun Xu, Ninglu Shao, Sunhao Dai</p>
    <p>The debut of ChatGPT has recently attracted significant attention from the natural language processing (NLP) community and beyond. Existing studies have demonstrated that ChatGPT shows significant improvement in a range of downstream NLP tasks, but the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in terms of recommendations remain unclear. In this study, we aim to enhance ChatGPT’s recommendation capabilities by aligning it with traditional information retrieval (IR) ranking capabilities, including point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise ranking. To achieve this goal, we re-formulate the aforementioned three recommendation policies into prompt formats tailored specifically to the domain at hand.  Through extensive experiments on four datasets from different domains, we analyze the distinctions among the three recommendation policies. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT achieves an optimal balance between cost and performance when equipped with list-wise ranking. This research sheds light on a promising direction for aligning ChatGPT with recommendation tasks. To facilitate further explorations in this area, the full code and detailed original results are open-sourced at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM4RS-532C/}.</p>

    <h3>Modeling Users and Items for Recommenders: There Is More than Semantics (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mete Sertkan</p>
    <p>Recommender systems aim to help us to take better decisions and thus to save resources and increase satisfaction. Personalized recommendations are their main asset. In some domains, such as tourism or news, recommender systems rely more on content-based approaches to give personalized recommendations, due to domain-specific challenges. Content-based methods tend to recommend items semantically similar to the users’ previous consumptions. However, the content of items (e.g., text, visuals, categories, etc.) usually contains more than semantic properties.<br>In this PhD work we focus on the multifaceted nature of the recommendation items. Besides the mentioned semantic properties, we also take into account visual and textual style elements and more complex concepts such as emotions and personality. Our aim is to address people also on a non-rational, non-verbal, and rather emotional level; and thus, to improve recommendations. We propose a statistical-learning-based characterization of items, a picture-based approach to profile users and items, and a neural end-to-end approach, where we learn to represent users and items, and simultaneously to recommend. In all of the proposed methods we consider in addition to the semantic content either stylistic elements and/or more complex concepts like personality, and observe their impact. To contribute the community, we plan to open source our code and the datasets (to the extent our collaborators agree).</p>
