    <h3>HELPeR: An Interactive Recommender System for Ovarian Cancer Patients and Their Caregivers (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khushboo Maulikmihir Thaker, Young Ji Lee, Peter Brusilovsky, Daqing He, Behnam Rahdari, Zhimeng Luo</p>
    <p>Recommending online resources to patients with ovarian cancer and their caregivers is a challenging task. On one hand, the recommended items must be relevant, recent, and reliable. On the other hand, they need to match the user’s levels of disease-specific health literacy. In this demonstration, we describe the overall architecture and key components of HELPeR, a knowledge-adaptive interactive recommender system for ovarian cancer patients and their caregivers.</p>

    <h3>Accordion: A Trainable Simulator for Long-Term Interactive Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James McInerney, Ehtsham Elahi, Yves Raimond, Tony Jebara, Justin Basilico</p>
    <p>As machine learning methods are increasingly used in interactive systems it becomes common for user experiences to be the result of an ecosystem of machine learning models in aggregate. Simulation offers a way to deal with the resulting complexity by approximating the real system in a tractable and interpretable manner. Existing methods do not fully incorporate the interactions between user history, recommendation quality, and subsequent visits. We develop Accordion, a trainable simulator based on Poisson processes that can model visit patterns to an interactive system over time from large-scale data. New methods for training and simulation are developed and tested on two datasets of real world interactive systems. Accordion shows greater sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning and offline A/B testing than comparison methods, an important step in building realistic task-oriented simulators for recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Context Adaptation in Interactive Recommender Systems (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Burke, Negar Hariri, Bamshad Mobasher</p>
    <p>Contextual factors can greatly influence the utility of recommendations for users. In many recommendation and personalization applications, particularly in domains where user context changes dynamically, it is difficult to represent and model contextual factors directly, but it is often possible to observe their impact on user preferences during the course of users’ interactions with the system. In this paper, we introduce an interactive recommender system that can detect and adapt to changes in context based on the user’s ongoing behavior. The system, then, dynamically tailors its recommendations to match the user’s most recent preferences. We formulate this problem as a multi-armed bandit problem and use Thompson sampling heuristic to learn a model for the user. Following the Thompson sampling approach, the user model is updated after each interaction as the system observes the corresponding rewards for the recommendations provided during that interaction. To generate contextual recommendations, the user’s preference model is monitored for changes at each step of interaction with the user and is updated incrementally. We will introduce a mechanism for detecting significant changes in the user’s preferences and will describe how it can be used to improve the performance of the recommender system.</p>
