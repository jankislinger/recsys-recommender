    <h3>Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-Behaviour Contrastive Learning for Effective Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iadh Ounis, Zeyuan Meng, Zixuan Yi</p>
    <p>Real-world recommendation scenarios usually need to handle diverse user-item interaction behaviours, including page views, adding items into carts, and purchasing activities. The interactions that precede the actual target behaviour (e.g. purchasing an item) allow to better capture the user’s preferences from different angles, and are used  as auxiliary information (e.g. page views) to enrich the system’s knowledge about the users’ preferences, thereby helping to enhance recommendation for the target behaviour. Despite efforts in modelling the users’ multi-behaviour interaction information, the existing multi-behaviour recommenders  still face two challenges: (1) Data sparsity across multiple user behaviours is a common issue that limits the recommendation performance, particularly for the target behaviour, which typically exhibits fewer interactions compared to other auxiliary behaviours. (2) Noisy auxiliary interactive behaviour where the information in the auxiliary information  might be non-relevant to recommendation.  In this case, a direct  adoption of  contrastive learning between the target behaviour and the auxiliary behaviours will amplify the noise in the auxiliary behaviours, thereby negatively impacting the real semantics that can be derived from the target behaviour. To address these two challenges, we propose a new model called Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-behaviour Contrastive Learning for Recommendation (KEMCL). In particular, to address the problem of sparse user multi-behaviour interaction information, we leverage a tailored knowledge graph (KG) to enrich the semantic representations of items, and generate supervision signals through self-supervised learning so as to enhance  recommendation. In addition, we develop two contrastive learning (CL) methods, inter CL and intra CL, to alleviate the problem of noisy auxiliary interactions. Extensive experiments on three public recommendation datasets show that our proposed KEMCL model significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In particular, our KEMCL model outperforms the best baseline performance, namely KMCLR,  by 5.42% on the large Tmall dataset.</p>

    <h3>Latent Factor Representations for Cold-Start Video Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sujoy Roy, Sharat Chandra Guntuku</p>
    <p>Recommending items that have rarely/never been viewed by users is a bottleneck for collaborative filtering (CF) based recommendation algorithms. To alleviate this problem, item content representation (mostly in textual form) has been used as auxiliary information for learning latent factor representations. In this work we present a novel method for learning latent factor representation for videos based on modelling the emotional connection between user and item. First of all we present a comparative analysis of state-of-the art emotion modelling approaches that brings out a surprising finding regarding the efficacy of latent factor representations in modelling emotion in video content. Based on this finding we present a method visual-CLiMF for learning latent factor representations for cold start videos based on implicit feedback. Visual-CLiMF is based on the popular collaborative less-is-more approach but demonstrates how emotional aspects of items could be used as auxiliary information to improve MRR performance. Experiments on a new data set and the Amazon products data set demonstrate the effectiveness of visual-CLiMF which outperforms existing CF methods with or without content information.</p>

    <h3>`Free Lunch’ Enhancement for Collaborative Filtering with Factorization Machines (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martha Larson, Alan Hanjalic, Babak Loni, Alan Said</p>
    <p>The advantage of Factorization Machines over other factorization models is their ability to easily integrate and efficiently exploit auxiliary information to improve Collaborative Filtering. Until now, this auxiliary information has been drawn from external knowledge sources beyond the user-item matrix. In this paper, we demonstrate that Factorization Machines can exploit additional representations of information inherent in the user-item matrix to improve recommendation performance. We refer to our approach as “Free Lunch” enhancement since it leverages clusters that are based on information that is present in the user-item matrix, but not otherwise directly exploited during matrix factorization. Borrowing clustering concepts from codebook sharing, our approach can also make use of “Free Lunch” information inherent in a user-item matrix from a auxiliary domain that is different from the target domain of the recommender. Our approach improves performance both in the joint case, in which the auxiliary and target domains share users, and in the disjoint case, in which they do not. Although “Free Lunch” enhancement does not apply equally well to any given domain or domain combination, our overall conclusion is that Factorization Machines present an opportunity to exploit information that is ubiquitously present, but commonly under-appreciated by Collaborative Filtering algorithms.</p>
