    <h3>Reproducibility of LLM-based Recommender Systems: the case study of P5 paradigm (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Polignano, Cataldo Musto, Giovanni Semeraro, Pasquale Lops, Antonio Silletti</p>
    <p>Recommender systems field may greatly benefit of the availability of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs), which can serve as the core mechanism to generate recommendations based on detailed user and item data, such as textual descriptions, user reviews, and metadata.  On one hand this new generation of LLM-based recommender systems paves the way to deal with traditional limitations, such as cold-start and data sparsity, but on the other hand this poses fundamental challenges for their accountability.  Reproducing experiments in the new context of LLM-based recommender systems is very challenging for several reasons. New approaches are published at an unprecedented pace, which makes difficult to have a clear picture of the main protocols and good practices in the experimental evaluation. Moreover, the lack of proper frameworks for LLM-based recommendation development and evaluation makes the process of benchmarking models complex and uncertain. In this work, we discuss the main issues encountered when trying to reproduce P5 (Pretrain, Personalized Prompt, and Prediction Paradigm), one of the first works unifying different recommendation tasks in a shared language modeling and natural language generation framework.  Starting from this study, we have developed OurFramework4LLM (anonymized name), a framework for training and evaluating LLMs, specifically for the recommendation task. It has been used to perform several experiments to assess the impact of different LLMs, personalization and novel set of more informative prompts on the overall performance of recommendations, in a fully reproducible environment.</p>

    <h3>Ranking Across Different Content Types: The Robust Beauty of Multinomial Blending (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Malte Lichtenberg, Giuseppe Di Benedetto, Matteo Ruffini</p>
    <p>An increasing number of media streaming services have expanded their offerings to include entities of multiple content types. For instance, audio streaming services that started by offering music only, now also offer podcasts, merchandise items, and (music) videos. Ranking items across different content types into a single slate poses a significant challenge for traditional learning-to-rank (LTR) algorithms due to differing feature sets and user engagement patterns for different content types. We explore a simple method, called multinomial blending (MB), which can be used in conjunction with most existing LTR algorithms. We compare MB to a range of baselines not only in terms of ranking quality but also from other industry-relevant perspectives such as interpretability, ease-of-use, and stability in dynamic online-learning environments.</p>

    <h3>Incorporating Time in Sequential Recommendation Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Caverlee, Mostafa Rahmani, Fei Wang</p>
    <p>Sequential models are designed to learn sequential patterns in data based on the chronological order of user interactions. However, they often ignore the timestamps of these interactions. Incorporating time is crucial because many sequential patterns are time-dependent, and the model cannot make time-aware recommendations without considering time. This article demonstrates that providing a rich representation of time can significantly improve the performance of sequential models. The existing literature treats time as a one-dimensional time-series obtained by quantizing time. In this study, we propose treating time as a multi-dimensional time-series and explore representation learning methods, including  a kernel based method and an embedding-based algorithm. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the inclusion of time significantly enhances the model’s performance, and multi-dimensional methods outperform the one-dimensional method by a substantial margin.</p>

    <h3>Eigenvalue Perturbation for Item-based Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesare Bernardis, Paolo Cremonesi</p>
    <p>Adding confidence estimates to predicted ratings has been shown to positively influence the quality of the recommendations provided by a recommender system. While confidence over single point predictions of ratings and preferences has been widely studied in literature, limited effort has been put in exploring the benefits provided by user-level confidence indices. In this work we exploit a recently introduced user-level confidence index, called eigenvalue confidence index, in order to provide maximum confidence recommendations for item-based recommender systems. We firstly derive a closed form solution to calculate the index, then we propose a new recommendation methodology for item-based models, called eigenvalue perturbation, founded on the strongly positive correlation between the index value and the accuracy of the recommendations. We show and discuss the accuracy results obtained with a comprehensive set of experiments over several datasets and using different item-based models, empirically proving that applying the new technique we are able to outperform the original recommendation models in most of the experimental configurations.</p>

    <h3>Compositional Network Embedding for Link Prediction (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Jiang, Wenwu Ou, Tianshu Lyu, Fei Sun, Yan Zhang</p>
    <p>Network embedding has proved extremely useful in a variety of network analysis tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and network visualization. Almost all the existing network embedding methods learn to map the node IDs to their corresponding node embeddings. This design principle, however, hinders the existing methods from being applied in real cases. Node ID is not generalizable and, thus, the existing methods have to pay great effort in cold-start problem. The heterogeneous network usually requires extra work to encode node types, as node type is not able to be identified by node ID. Node ID carries rare information, resulting in the criticism that the existing methods are not robust to noise. To address this issue, we introduce Compositional Network Embedding, a general inductive network representation learning framework that generates node embeddings by combining node features based on the ‘principle of compositionally’. Instead of directly optimizing an embedding lookup based on arbitrary node IDs, we learn a composition function that infers node embeddings by combining the corresponding node attribute embeddings through a graph-based loss. For evaluation, we conduct the experiments on link prediction under four different settings. The results verified the effectiveness and generalization ability of compositional network embeddings, especially on unseen nodes. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Semantic-based Tag Recommendation in Scientific Bookmarking Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hebatallah A. Mohamed Hassan</p>
    <p>Recently, tagging has become a common way for users to organize and share digital content, and tag recommendation (TR) has become a very important research topic. Most of the recommendation approaches which are based on text embedding have utilized bag-of-words technique. On the other hand, proposed deep learning methods for capturing semantic meanings in the text, have been proved to be effective in various natural language processing (NLP) applications. In this paper, we present a content-based TR method that adopts deep recurrent neural networks to encode titles and abstracts of scientific articles into semantic vectors for enhancing the recommendation task, specifically bidirectional gated recurrent units (bi-GRUs) with attention mechanism. The experimental evaluation is performed on a dataset from CiteULike. The overall findings show that the proposed model is effective in representing scientific articles for tag recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Recommending New Items to Ephemeral Groups Using Contextual User Influence (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Letizia Tanca, Elisa Quintarelli, Emanuele Rabosio</p>
    <p>Group recommender systems help groups of users in finding appropriate items to be enjoyed together. Lots of activities, like watching TV or going to the restaurant, are intrinsically group-based, thus making the group recommendation problem very relevant. In this paper we study ephemeral groups, i.e., groups where the members might be together for the first time. Recent approaches have tackled this issue introducing complex models to be learned offline, making them unable to deal with new items; on the contrary, we propose a group recommender able to manage new items too. In more detail, our technique determines the preference of a group for an item by combining the individual preferences of the group members on the basis of their contextual influence, where the contextual influence represents the ability of an individual, in a given situation, to direct the group’s decision. We conducted an extensive experimental evaluation on a TV dataset containing a log of viewings performed by real groups, showing how our approach outperforms the comparable techniques from the literature.</p>

    <h3>POI Recommendation: Towards Fused Matrix Factorization with Geographical and Temporal Influences (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Talel Abdessalem, Jean-Benoît Griesner, Hubert Naacke</p>
    <p>Providing personalized point-of-interest (POI) recommendation has become a major issue with the rapid emergence of location-based social networks (LBSNs). Unlike traditional recommendation approaches, the LBSNs application domain comes with significant geographical and temporal dimensions. Moreover most of traditional recommendation algorithms fail to cope with the specific challenges implied by these two dimensions. Fusing geographical and temporal influences for better recommendation accuracy in LBSNs remains unexplored, as far as we know. We depict how matrix factorization can serve POI recommendation, and propose a novel attempt to integrate both geographical and temporal influences into matrix factorization. Specifically we present GeoMF-TD, an extension of geographical matrix factorization with temporal dependencies. Our experiments on a real dataset shows up to 20% benefit on recommendation precision.</p>

    <h3>Recommending User Generated Item Lists (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min Xie, Yidan Liu, Laks V.S. Lakshmanan</p>
    <p>Existing recommender systems mostly focus on recommending individual items which users may be interested in. User-generated item lists on the other hand have become a popular feature in many applications. E.g., Goodreads provides users with an interface for creating and sharing interesting book lists. These user-generated item lists complement the main functionality of the corresponding application, and intuitively become an alternative way for users to browse and discover interesting items to be consumed. Unfortunately, existing recommender systems are not designed for recommending user-generated item lists. In this work, we study properties of these user-generated item lists and propose a Bayesian ranking model, called \LRM for recommending them. The proposed \LRM model takes into consideration users’ previous interactions with both item lists and with individual items. Furthermore, we propose in \LRM a novel way of weighting items within item lists based on both position of items, and personalized list consumption pattern. Through extensive experiments on real item list dataset from Goodreads, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed \LRM model.</p>
