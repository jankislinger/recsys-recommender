    <h3>AI-based Human-Centered Recommender Systems: Empirical Experiments and Research Infrastructure (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixuan Sun</p>
    <p>This is a dissertation plan built around human-centered empirical experiments evaluating recommender systems (RecSys). We see this as an important research theme since many AI-based RecSys algorithmic studies lack real human assessment. Therefore, we do not know how they work in the wild that only human experiments can tell us. We split this extended abstract into two parts — 1) A series of individual studies focusing on open questions about different human values or recommendation algorithms. Our completed works include user control over content diversity, user appreciation on DL-RecSys algorithms, and human-LLMRec interaction study. We also propose three future works to understand news recommendation depolarization, personalized news podcast, and interactive user representation; 2) An experimentation infrastructure named POPROX. As a personalized news recommendation platform, it aims to support the longitudinal study needs from the general AI and RecSys research community.</p>

    <h3>Going Beyond Local: Global Graph-Enhanced Personalized News Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irene Li, Ruihai Dong, Dairui Liu, Toyotaro Suzumura, Boming Yang</p>
    <p>Precisely recommending candidate news articles to users has always been a core challenge for personalized news recommendation systems. Most recent work primarily focuses on using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract semantic information from rich textual data, employing content-based methods derived from locally viewed historical clicked news. However, this approach lacks a global perspective, failing to account for users’ hidden motivations and behaviors beyond semantic information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model called GLORY(Global-LOcal news Recommendation sYstem), which combines global news representations learned from other users with local news representations to enhance personalized recommendation systems. We accomplish this by constructing a Global Clicked News Encoder, which includes a global news graph and employs gated graph neural networks to fuse news representations, thereby enriching clicked news representations. Similarly, we extend this approach to a Global Candidate News Encoder, utilizing a global entity graph and candidate news fusion to enhance candidate news representation. Evaluation results on two public news datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Furthermore, our model offers more diverse recommendations.</p>

    <h3>A Model-Agnostic Framework for Recommendation via Interest-aware Item Embeddings (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Xiong, Amit Kumar Jaiswal</p>
    <p>Item representation holds significant importance in recommendation systems, which encompasses domains such as news, retail, and videos. Retrieval and ranking models utilise item representation to capture the user-item relationship based on user behaviours. While existing representation learning methods primarily focus on optimising item-based mechanisms, such as attention and sequential modelling. However, these methods lack a modelling mechanism to directly reflect user interests within the learned item representations. Consequently, these methods may be less effective in capturing user interests indirectly. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Interest-aware Capsule network (IaCN) recommendation model, a model-agnostic framework that directly learns interest-oriented item representations. IaCN serves as an auxiliary task, enabling the joint learning of both item-based and interest-based representations. This framework adopts existing recommendation models without requiring substantial redesign. We evaluate the proposed approach on benchmark datasets, exploring various scenarios involving different deep neural networks, behaviour sequence lengths, and joint learning ratios of interest-oriented item representations. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance enhancements across diverse recommendation models, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

    <h3>RADio – Rank-Aware Divergence Metrics to Measure Normative Diversity in News Recommendations (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mateo Gutierrez Granada, Sanne Vrijenhoek, Maarten de Rijke, Gabriel Bénédict, Daan Odijk</p>
    <p>In traditional recommender system literature, diversity is often seen as the opposite of similarity, and typically defined as the distance between identified topics, categories or word models. However, this is not expressive of the social science’s interpretation of diversity, which accounts for a news organization’s norms and values and which we here refer to as normative diversity. We introduce RADio, a versatile metrics framework to evaluate recommendations according to these normative goals. RADio introduces a rank-aware Jensen Shannon (JS) divergence. This combination accounts for (i) a user’s decreasing propensity to observe items further down a list and (ii) full distributional shifts as opposed to point estimates. We evaluate RADio’s ability to reflect five normative concepts in news recommendations on the Microsoft News Dataset and six (neural) recommendation algorithms, with the help of our metadata enrichment pipeline. We find that RADio provides insightful estimates that can potentially be used to inform news recommender system design.</p>

    <h3>Adaptive Pointwise-Pairwise Learning-to-Rank for Content-based Personalized Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Michel Renders, Yagmur Gizem Cinar</p>
    <p>This paper extends the standard pointwise and pairwise paradigms for learning-to-rank in the context of personalized recommendation, by considering these two approaches as two extremes of a continuum of possible strategies. It basically consists of a surrogate loss that models how to select and combine these two approaches adaptively, depending on the context (query or user, pair of items, etc.). In other words, given a training instance, which is typically a triplet (a query/user and two items with different preferences or relevance grades), the strategy adaptively determines whether it is better to focus on the “most preferred” item (pointwise - positive instance), on the “less preferred” one (pointwise - negative instance) or on the pair (pairwise), or on anything else in between these 3 extreme alternatives. We formulate this adaptive strategy as minimizing a particular loss function that generalizes simultaneously the traditional pointwise and pairwise loss functions (negative log-likelihood) through a mixture coefficient. This coefficient is formulated as a learnable function of the features associated to the triplet. Experimental results on several real-world news recommendation datasets show clear improvements over several pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches.</p>

    <h3>Item Cold-Start Recommendations: Learning Local Collective Embeddings (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Saveski, Amin Mantrach</p>
    <p>Recommender systems suggest to users items that they might like (e.g., news articles, songs, movies) and, in doing so, they help users deal with information overload and enjoy a personalized experience. One of the main problems of these systems is the item cold-start, i.e., when a new item is introduced in the system and no past information is available, then no effective recommendations can be produced. The item cold-start is a very common problem in practice: modern online platforms have hundreds of new items published every day. To address this problem, we propose to learn Local Collective Embeddings — a matrix factorization that exploits items’ properties and past user preferences while enforcing the manifold structure exhibited by the collective embeddings. We present a learning algorithm based on multiplicative update rules that are efficient and easy to implement. Experiments on two item cold-start use cases: news recommendation and email recipient recommendation, demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and show that it significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art methods for item cold-start.</p>
