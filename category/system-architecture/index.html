    <h3>Accelerating Creator Audience Building through Centralized Exploration (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilherme Dinis Junior, Olayinka S. Folorunso, Gösta Forsum, Maksym Lefarov, Lucas Maystre, Antonina Danylenko, Buket Baran, Yu Zhao</p>
    <p>On Spotify, multiple recommender systems enable personalized user experiences across a wide range of product features. These systems are owned by different teams and serve different goals, but all of these systems need to explore and learn about new content as it appears on the platform. In this work, we describe ongoing efforts at Spotify to develop an efficient solution to this problem, by centralizing content exploration and providing signals to existing, decentralized recommendation systems (a.k.a. exploitation systems). We take a creator-centric perspective, and argue that this approach can dramatically reduce the time it takes for new content to reach its full potential.</p>

    <h3>Localify.org: Locally-focus Music Artist and Event Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cassandra Raineault, Kieran Bentley, Griffin Homan, Paul Gagliano, April Trainor, Elizabeth Richards, Douglas Turnbull, Victoria Conrad</p>
    <p>Cities with strong local music scenes enjoy many social and economic benefits.  To this end, we are interested in developing a locally-focused artist and event recommendation system called Localify.org that supports and promotes local music scenes. Local artists tend to be relatively obscure and reside in the long tail of the artist’s popularity distribution. In this demo paper, we describe both the overall system architecture as well as our core recommender system that uses artist-artist similarity information as opposed to user-artist preference information. We also discuss the role of popularity bias and how we attempt to ameliorate it in the context of local music recommendation.</p>

    <h3>HELPeR: An Interactive Recommender System for Ovarian Cancer Patients and Their Caregivers (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khushboo Maulikmihir Thaker, Young Ji Lee, Peter Brusilovsky, Daqing He, Behnam Rahdari, Zhimeng Luo</p>
    <p>Recommending online resources to patients with ovarian cancer and their caregivers is a challenging task. On one hand, the recommended items must be relevant, recent, and reliable. On the other hand, they need to match the user’s levels of disease-specific health literacy. In this demonstration, we describe the overall architecture and key components of HELPeR, a knowledge-adaptive interactive recommender system for ovarian cancer patients and their caregivers.</p>

    <h3>On the Heterogeneous Information Needs in the Job Domain: A Unified Platform for Student Career (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Reiter-Haas</p>
    <p>Finding the right job is a difficult task for anyone as it usually depends on many factors like salary, job description, or geographical location. Students with almost no prior experience, especially, have a hard time on the job market, which is very competitive in nature. Additionally, students often suffer a lack of orientation, as they do not know what kind of job is suitable for their education. At Talto1, we realized this and have built a platform to help Austrian university students with finding their career paths as well as providing them with content that is relevant to their career possibilities. This is mainly achieved by guiding the students toward different types of entities that are related to their career, i.e., job postings, company profiles, and career-related articles.<br>In this talk, we share our experiences with solving the recommendation problem for university students. One trait of the student-focused job domain is that behaviour of the students differs depending on their study progression. At the beginning of their studies, they need study-specific career information and part-time jobs to earn additional money. Whereas, when they are nearing graduation, they require information about their potential future employers and entry-level full-time jobs. Moreover, we can observe seasonal patterns in user activity in addition to the need of handling both logged-in and anonymous session users at the same time.<br>To cope with the requirements of the job domain, we built hybrid models based on a microservice architecture that utilizes popular algorithms from the literature such as Collaborative Filtering, Content-based Filtering as well as various neural embedding approaches (e.g., Doc2Vec, Autoencoders, etc.). We further adapted our architecture to calculate relevant recommendations in real-time (i.e., after a recommendation is requested) as individual user sessions in Talto are usually short-lived and context-dependent. Here we found that the online performance of the utilized approach also depends on the location context [1]. Hence, the current location of a user on the mobile or web application impacts the expected recommendations.<br>One optimization criterion on the Talto career platform is to provide relevant cross-entity recommendations as well as explain why those were shown. Recently, we started to tackle this by learning embeddings of entities that lie in the same embedding space [2]. Specifically, we pre-train word embeddings and link different entities by shared concepts, which we use for training the network embeddings. This embeds both the concepts and the entities into a common vector space, where the common vector space is a result of considering the textual content, as well as the network information (i.e., links to concepts). This way, different entity types (e.g., job postings, company profiles, and articles) are directly comparable and are suited for a real-time recommendation setting. Interestingly enough, with such an approach we also end up with individual words sharing the same embedding space. This, in turn, can be leveraged to enhance the textual search functionality of a platform, which is most commonly based just on a TF-IDF model.<br>Furthermore, we found that such embeddings allow us to tackle the problem of explainability in an algorithm-agnostic way. Since the Talto platform utilizes various recommendation algorithms as well as continuously conducts AB tests, an algorithm-agnostic explainability model would be best suited to provide the students with meaningful explanations. As such, we will also go into the details on how we can adapt our explanation model to not rely on the utilized recommendation algorithm.</p>

    <h3>Practical Lessons from Developing a Large-Scale Recommender System at Zalando (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonino Freno</p>
    <p>Developing a real-world recommender system, i.e. for use in large-scale online retail, poses a number of different challenges. Interestingly, only a small part of these challenges are of algorithmic nature, such as how to select the most accurate model for a given use case. Instead, most technical problems usually arise from operational constraints, such as: adaptation to novel use cases; cost and complexity of system maintenance; capability of reusing pre-existing signal and integrating heterogeneous data sources. In this paper, we describe the system we developed in order to address those constraints at Zalando, which is one of the most popular online fashion retailers in Europe. In particular, we explain how moving from a collaborative filtering approach to a learning-to-rank model helped us to effectively tackle the challenges mentioned above, while improving at the same time the quality of our recommendations. A fairly detailed description of our software architecture is provided, along with an overview of the algorithmic approach. On the other hand, we present some of the offline and online experiments that we ran in order to validate our models.</p>
