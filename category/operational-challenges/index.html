    <h3>Building public service recommenders: Logbook of a journey (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Piscopo</p>
    <p>Almost a hundred years old, the BBC is the world’s largest public service broadcasters, providing a broad range of digital, radio, and television services. At the core of what it does, sits the BBC’s mission to “act in the public interest, serving all audiences through the provision of impartial, high-quality and distinctive output and services which inform, educate, and entertain” [ 3]. The BBC’s remit is to be a provider of high quality, accurate, and unbiased content that should aim to engage its audiences, reflecting their diversity, e.g. with respect to their age, culture, and socio-economic background, and following the values of trust and the commitment to being independent, impartial, and honest. Editorial staff follows a large collection of editorial guidelines [ 5] to ensure that all BBC’s output is consistent with these principles. Every week, the BBC reaches more than 80% of UK’s adult population [4 ] and 279 million people worldwide [ 2], giving access to a vast and diverse amount of content, including video, audio, and text, spanning topics such as news, sport, education, and entertainment. BBC content is prized the world over for its quality. However, the media landscape has changed substantially since the BBC was founded, introducing users to unlimited content. Personalised experiences are the norm in online media platforms, e.g. Spotify or Netflix, and are valued positively; for example, personalisation in news has been found found to increase depth and diversity of content [1]. How can the BBC stay relevant for all its audiences this environment? Delivering a personalised experience which is relevant, timely, and contextually useful to every user is key to fulfil the public service remit of the BBC. We need to reach out and appeal to the under-served groups, such as young audiences or ethnic minorities, to be a BBC for each and everyone and not just for the majority. Although this is an excellent way to surface quality content and produce engaging content discovery paths, it is inherently unable to be tailored to the user and is hard to scale—the more the amount of content, the harder it is for curators to find relevant items. Automated recommendations are able to attain these goals. Nevertheless, the shift from manual curation to data-driven personalisation is a change of perspective that entails a number of challenges: Cultural challenges: Editorial have so far decided which pieces of content to surface and how these are connected. How do we switch to a data-driven approach which connects every single audience member to the most relevant and engaging content, while retaining the quality ensured by the domain experts’ experience? Operational challenges: Editorial have the last say on all BBC output and guarantee its compliance with the editorial guidelines. Data-driven personalised content makes no exception to that. How does editorial oversight apply to large-scale recommendations? How do we translate editorial guidelines into data science approaches, tools, and metrics? Infrastructural challenges: The BBC has a large number of products and services. How do we enable data scientists and data engineers to create and deploy highly performant recommenders with the minimal possible effort? This document outlines the technical solutions and work processes our team, Datalab, have devised and the lessons we learnt along this journey.</p>

    <h3>Practical Lessons from Developing a Large-Scale Recommender System at Zalando (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonino Freno</p>
    <p>Developing a real-world recommender system, i.e. for use in large-scale online retail, poses a number of different challenges. Interestingly, only a small part of these challenges are of algorithmic nature, such as how to select the most accurate model for a given use case. Instead, most technical problems usually arise from operational constraints, such as: adaptation to novel use cases; cost and complexity of system maintenance; capability of reusing pre-existing signal and integrating heterogeneous data sources. In this paper, we describe the system we developed in order to address those constraints at Zalando, which is one of the most popular online fashion retailers in Europe. In particular, we explain how moving from a collaborative filtering approach to a learning-to-rank model helped us to effectively tackle the challenges mentioned above, while improving at the same time the quality of our recommendations. A fairly detailed description of our software architecture is provided, along with an overview of the algorithmic approach. On the other hand, we present some of the offline and online experiments that we ran in order to validate our models.</p>
