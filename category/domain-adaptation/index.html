    <h3>Discerning Canonical User Representation for Cross-Domain Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sherry Sahebi, Siqian Zhao</p>
    <p>Cross-domain recommender systems have emerged, to address the cold-start problem and enhance recommendation outcomes by leveraging information transfer across different domains. Existing cross-domain recommender systems have investigated the learning of both domain-specific and domain-shared user preferences to enhance recommendation performance. However, these models typically allow the disparities between shared and distinct user preferences to emerge freely in any space, lacking sufficient constraints to identify differences between two domains and ensure that both domains are considered simultaneously. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) has shown promise for transferring information between domains, by mapping their user representations into the same space. But, CCA only models domain similarities, and fails to capture the potential differences between user preferences in different domains. In this paper, we propose Discerning Canonical User Representation Learning for Cross-Domain Recommendation (DICUCDR), a generative adversarial networks (GAN) based method that learns both domain-shared and domain-specific user representations. DICUCDR introduces Discerning Canonical Correlation User Representation Learning (DCCRL), a novel design of non-linear Canonical Correlation mappings that creates a shared transformation for simultaneously mapping similarities between different domains and separating domain differences from domains. We compare DICUCDR against several state-of-the-art approaches using two real-world datasets. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of separately learning shared and specific user representations via DCCRL.</p>

    <h3>TLRec: A Transfer Learning Framework to Enhance Large Language Models for Sequential Recommendation Tasks (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuang Peng, Jiaye Lin, Zhong Zhang, Peilin Zhao</p>
    <p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in recommendation systems, improving recommendation performance through in-context learning or parameter-efficient fine-tuning. However, cross-domain generalization, i.e., model training in one scenario (source domain) but inference in another (target domain), is underexplored. In this paper, we present TLRec, a transfer learning framework aimed at enhancing LLMs for sequential recommendation tasks. TLRec specifically focuses on text inputs to mitigate the challenge of limited transferability across diverse domains, offering promising advantages over traditional recommendation models that heavily depend on unique identities (IDs) like user IDs and item IDs. Moreover, we leverage the source domain data to further enhance LLMs’ performance in the target domain. Initially, we employ powerful closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) and chain-of-thought techniques to construct instruction tuning data from the third-party scenario (source domain). Subsequently, we apply curriculum learning to fine-tune LLMs for effective knowledge injection and perform recommendations in the target domain. Experimental results demonstrate that TLRec achieves superior performance under the zero-shot and few-shot settings.</p>

    <h3>Domain Adaptation in Display Advertising: An Application for Partner Cold-Start (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pranjul Yadav, S. Sathiya Keerthi, Karan Aggarwal</p>
    <p>Digital advertisements connects partners (sellers) to potentially interested online users. Within the digital advertisement domain,there are multiple platforms,e.g.,user re-targeting and prospecting. Partners usually start with re-targeting campaigns and later employ prospecting campaigns to reach out to untapped customer base. There are two major challenges involved with prospecting. The first challenge is successful on-boarding of a new partner on the prospecting platform, referred to as partner cold-start problem. The second challenge revolves around the ability to leverage large amounts of re-targeting data for partner cold-start problem. In this work, we study domain adaptation for the partner cold-start problem. To this end, we propose two domain adaptation techniques, SDA-DANN and SDA-Ranking. SDA-DANN and SDA-Ranking extend domain adaptation techniques for partner cold-start by incorporating sub-domain similarities (product category level information). Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that our method SDA-DANN outperforms baseline domain adaptation techniques on real-world dataset, obtained from a major online advertiser. Furthermore, we show that our proposed technique SDA-Ranking outperforms baseline methods for low CTR partners</p>

    <h3>Word2vec applied to Recommendation: Hyperparameters Matter (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jimena Royo-Letelier, Hugo Caselles-Dupré, Florian Lesaint</p>
    <p>Skip-gram with negative sampling, a popular variant of Word2vec originally designed and tuned to create word embeddings for Natural Language Processing, has been used to create item embeddings with successful applications in recommendation. While these fields do not share the same type of data, neither evaluate on the same tasks, recommendation applications tend to use the same already tuned hyperparameters values, even if optimal hyperparameters values are often known to be data and task dependent. We thus investigate the marginal importance of each hyperparameter in a recommendation setting through large hyperparameter grid searches on various datasets. Results reveal that optimizing neglected hyperparameters, namely negative sampling distribution, number of epochs, subsampling parameter and window-size, significantly improves performance on a recommendation task, and can increase it by an order of magnitude. Importantly, we find that optimal hyperparameters configurations for Natural Language Processing tasks and Recommendation tasks are noticeably different.</p>

    <h3>Causal Embeddings for Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flavian Vaslie, Stephen Bonner</p>
    <p>Many current applications use recommendations in order to modify the natural user behavior, such as to increase the number of sales or the time spent on a website. This results in a gap between the final recommendation objective and the classical setup where recommendation candidates are evaluated by their coherence with past user behavior, by predicting either the missing entries in the user-item matrix, or the most likely next event. To bridge this gap, we optimize a recommendation policy for the task of increasing the desired outcome versus the organic user behavior. We show this is equivalent to learning to predict recommendation outcomes under a fully random recommendation policy. To this end, we propose a new domain adaptation algorithm that learns from logged data containing outcomes from a biased recommendation policy and predicts recommendation outcomes according to random exposure. We compare our method against state-of-the-art factorization methods and new approaches of causal recommendation and show significant improvements.</p>

    <h3>Multi Cross Domain Recommendation Using Item Embedding And Canonical Correlation Analysis (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Kazama, Istvan Varga</p>
    <p>In a multi-service environment it is crucial to be able to leverage user behavior from one or more domains to create personalized recommendations in the other domain. In our paper, we present a robust transfer learning approach that successfully captures user behavior across multiple domains. First, we vectorize users and items in each domain independently. Second, using a handful of common users across domain pairs, we project each domain vector space into a common vector space using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Next, recommendations can be performed by recommending the items in any domains that are closest to the user’s vector in the common space. We also experimented on what kind of domain combination works well.</p>

    <h3>T-RecS: A Framework for a Temporal Semantic Analysis of the ACM Recommender Systems Conference (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Lops, Fedelucio Narducci, Marco De Gemmis, Giovanni Semeraro, Pierpaolo Basile</p>
    <p>This paper presents T-RecS (Temporal analysis of Recommender Systems conference proceedings), a framework that supplies services to analyze the Recommender Systems Conference proceedings from the first edition, held in 2007, to the last one, held in 2015, under a temporal point of view. The idea behind T-RecS is to identify linguistic phenomena that reflect some interesting variations for the research community, such as topic drift, or how the correlation between two terms changed over time, or how similarity between two authors evolved over time. The implemented framework can be easily adapted for the analysis of different corpora and domains.</p>

    <h3>Conversational Recommendation System with Unsupervised Learning (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roger Jin, Yi Zhang, Yueming Sun, Yunfei Chen</p>
    <p>We will demonstrate a conversational products recommendation agent. This system shows how we combine research in personalized recommendation systems with research in dialogue systems to build a virtual sales agent. Based on new deep learning technologies we developed, the virtual agent is capable of learning how to interact with users, how to answer user questions, what is the next question to ask, and what to recommend when chatting with a human user. Normally a descent conversational agent for a particular domain requires tens of thousands of hand labeled conversational data or hand written rules. This is a major barrier when launching a conversation agent for a new domain. We will explore and demonstrate the effectiveness of the learning solution even when there is no hand written rules or hand labeled training data.</p>
