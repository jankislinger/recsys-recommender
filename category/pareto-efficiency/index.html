    <h3>A Pareto-Efficient Algorithm for Multiple Objective Optimization in E-Commerce Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Jiang, Hongjie Chen, Yongfeng Zhang, Hanxiao Sun, Wenwu Ou, Xuanji Xiao, Xiao Lin, Changhua Pei, Fei Sun</p>
    <p>Recommendation with multiple objectives is an important but difficult problem, where the coherent difficulty lies in the possible conflicts between objectives. In this case, multi-objective optimization is expected to be Pareto efficient, where no single objective can be further improved without hurting the others. However existing approaches to Pareto efficient multi-objective recommendation still lack good theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a general framework for generating Pareto efficient recommendations. Assuming that there are formal differentiable formulations for the objectives, we coordinate these objectives with a weighted aggregation. Then we propose a condition ensuring Pareto efficiency theoretically and a two-step Pareto efficient optimization algorithm. Meanwhile the algorithm can be easily adapted for Pareto Frontier generation and fair recommendation selection. We specifically apply the proposed framework on E-Commerce recommendation to optimize GMV and CTR simultaneously. Extensive online and offline experiments are conducted on the real-world E-Commerce recommender system and the results validate the Pareto efficiency of the framework. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to provide a Pareto efficient framework for multi-objective recommendation with theoretical guarantees. Moreover, the framework can be applied to any other objectives with differentiable formulations and any model with gradients, which shows its strong scalability.</p>

    <h3>Fairness-Aware Group Recommendation with Pareto Efficiency (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Lin, Shaoping Ma, Zhaoquan Gu, Yiqun Liu, Min Zhang, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
    <p>Group recommendation has attracted significant research efforts for its importance in benefiting a group of users. This paper investigates the Group Recommendation problem from a novel aspect which tries to maximize the satisfaction of each group member while minimizing the unfairness between them. In this work, we present several semantics of the individual utility and propose two concepts of social welfare and fairness for modeling the overall utilities and the balance of group members. We formulate the problem as a multiple objective optimization problem and show its computational complexity (NP-Hardness Analysis) in different semantics. Given the multiple-objective nature of fairness-aware group recommendation problem, we provide an optimization framework for fairness-aware group recommendation from the perspective of Pareto Efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets (one of which contains real group structures and purchase histories) and evaluate our algorithm with standard accuracy metrics. The results indicate that considering fairness in group recommendation can enhance the recommendation accuracy.</p>
