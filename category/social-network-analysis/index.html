    <h3>The Dual Echo Chamber: Modeling Social Media Polarization for Interventional Recommending (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jürgen Ziegler, Tim Donkers</p>
    <p>Echo chambers are social phenomena that amplify agreement and suppress opposing views in social media which may lead to fragmentation and polarization of the user population. In prior research, echo chambers have mainly been modeled as a result of social information diffusion. While most scientific work has framed echo chambers as a result of epistemic imbalances between polarized communities, we argue that members of echo chambers often actively discredit outside sources to maintain coherent world views. We therefore argue that two different types of echo chambers occur in social media contexts: Epistemic echo chambers create information gaps mainly through their structure whereas ideological echo chambers systematically exclude counter-attitudinal information. Diversifying recommendations by simply widening the scope of topics and viewpoints covered to counteract the echo chamber effect may be ineffective in such contexts. To investigate the characteristics of this dual echo chamber view and to assess the depolarizing effects of diversified recommendations, we apply an agent-based modeling approach. We rely on knowledge graph embedding techniques not only to generate recommendations, but also to show how to utilize logical graph queries in embedding spaces to diversify recommendations aimed at challenging polarization in online discussions. The results of our evaluation indicate that counteracting the two different types of echo chambers requires fundamentally different diversification strategies.</p>

    <h3>I want to break free! Recommending friends from outside the echo chamber (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniela Godoy, Antonela Tommasel, Juan Manuel Rodriguez</p>
    <p>Recommender systems serve as mediators of information consumption and propagation. In this role, these systems have been recently criticized for introducing biases and promoting the creation of echo chambers and filter bubbles, thus lowering the diversity of both content and potential new social relations users are exposed to. Some of these issues are a consequence of the fundamental concepts on which recommender systems are based on. Assumptions like the homophily principle might lead users to content that they already like or friends they already know, which can be naïve in the era of ideological uniformity and fake news. A significant challenge in this context is how to effectively learn the dynamic representations of users based on the content they share and their echo chamber or community interactions to recommend potentially relevant and diverse friends from outside the network of influence of the users’ echo chamber. To address this, we devise FRediECH (a Friend RecommenDer for breakIng Echo CHambers), an echo chamber-aware friend recommendation approach that learns users and echo chamber representations from the shared content and past users’ and communities’ interactions. Comprehensive evaluations over Twitter data showed that our approach achieved better performance (in terms of relevance and novelty) than state-of-the-art alternatives, validating its effectiveness.</p>

    <h3>Deep Social Collaborative Filtering (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiliang Tang, Yao Ma, Dawei Yin, Jianping Wang, Wenqi Fan, Qing Li</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are crucial to alleviate the information overload problem in online worlds. Most of the modern recommender systems capture users’ preference towards items via their interactions based on collaborative filtering techniques. In addition to the user-item interactions, social networks can also provide useful information to understand users’ preference as suggested by the social theories such as homophily and influence. Recently, deep neural networks have been utilized for social recommendations, which facilitate both the user-item interactions and the social network information. However, most of these models cannot take full advantage of the social network information. They only use information from direct neighbors, but distant neighbors can also provide helpful information. Meanwhile, most of these models treat neighbors’ information equally without considering the specific recommendations. However, for a specific recommendation case, the information relevant to the specific item would be helpful. Besides, most of these models do not explicitly capture the neighbor’s opinions to items for social recommendations, while different opinions could affect the user differently. In this paper, to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose DSCF, a Deep Social Collaborative Filtering framework, which can exploit the social relations with various aspects for recommender systems. Comprehensive experiments on two-real world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

    <h3>How Long to Stay Where? On the Amount of Item Consumption in Travel Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wolfgang Wörndl, Linus W. Dietz</p>
    <p>Recommender systems could benefit from not only recommending the most fitting items, but also in what quantity the user should consume them. For example, a personalized travel recommender system could indicate not just which city one should travel to, but also how much time to spend there. We present a data-driven solution to this problem based on mining trips from location-based social networks. To determine the recommended duration of stay at a destination, we consider how long travelers typically stay at different cities and how much time the current user generally spends visiting cities.</p>

    <h3>PushTrust: An Efficient Recommendation Algorithm by Leveraging Trust and Distrust Relations (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdol-Hossein Esfahanian, Hayder Radha, Farzan Masrour, Iman Barjasteh, Rana Forsati</p>
    <p>The significance of social-enhanced recommender systems is increasing, along with its practicality, as online reviews, ratings, friendship links, and follower relationships are increasingly becoming available. In recent years, there has been an upsurge of interest in exploiting social information, such as trust and distrust relations in recommendation algorithms. The goal is to improve the quality of suggestions and mitigate the data sparsity and the cold-start users problems in existing systems. In this paper, we introduce a general model to rank the latent features of users extracted from rating data based on the social context of users. In contrast to existing social regularization methods, the proposed framework is able to simultaneously leverage trust, distrust, and neutral relations, and has a linear dependency on the social network size. By integrating the ranking based social regularization idea into the matrix factorization algorithm, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm, dubbed . Our experiments on the Epinions dataset demonstrate that collaboratively ranking the latent features of users by exploiting trust and distrust relations leads to a substantial increase in performance, and to effectively deal with cold-start users problem.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Latent Social Listening Representations for Music Recommendations (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Hsuan Yang, Ming-Feng Tsai, Yu-Ching Lin, Chih-Ming Chen, Po-Chuan Chien</p>
    <p>Music listening can be regarded as a social activity, in which people can listen together and make friends with one other. Therefore, social relationships may imply multiple facets of the users, such as their listening behaviors and tastes. In this light, it is considered that social relationships hold abundant valuable information that can be utilized for music recommendation. However, utilizing the information for recommendation could be difficult, because such information is usually sparse. To address this issue, we propose to learn the latent social listening representations by the DeepWalk method, and then integrate the learned representations into Factorization Machines to construct better recommendation models. With the DeepWalk method, user social relationships can be transformed from the sparse and independent and identically distributed ( ) form into a dense and non- form. In addition, the latent representations can also capture the spatial locality among users and items, therefore benefiting the constructed recommendation models.</p>

    <h3>Social Collaborative Filtering for Cold-start Recommendations (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jordan Christensen, Scott Sanner, Lexing Xie, Darius Braziunas, Suvash Sedhain</p>
    <p>We examine the cold-start recommendation task in an online retail setting for users who have not yet purchased (or interacted in a meaningful way with) any available items but who have granted access to limited side information, such as basic demographic data (gender, age, location) or social network information (Facebook friends or page likes). We formalize neighborhood-based methods for cold-start collaborative filtering in a generalized matrix algebra framework that does not require purchase data for target users when their side information is available. In real-data experiments with 30,000 users who purchased 80,000+ books and had 9,000,000+ Facebook friends and 6,000,000+ page likes, we show that using Facebook page likes for cold-start recommendation yields up to a 3-fold improvement in mean average precision (mAP) and up to 6-fold improvements in Precision@k and Recall@k compared to most-popular-item, demographic, and Facebook friend cold-start recommenders. These results demonstrate the substantial predictive power of social network content, and its significant utility in a challenging problem – recommendation for cold-start users.</p>

    <h3>Recommending Tumblr Blogs to Follow with Inductive Matrix Completion (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donghyuk Shin, Suleyman Cetintas, Kuang-Chih Lee</p>
    <p>In microblogging sites, recommending blogs (users) to follow is one of the core tasks for enhancing user experience. In this paper, we propose a novel inductive matrix completion based blog recommendation method to effectively utilize multiple rich sources of evidence such as the social network and the content as well as the activity data from users and blogs. Experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset from Tumblr show the effectiveness of the proposed blog recommendation method.</p>
