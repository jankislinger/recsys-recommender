    <h3>Early Lessons from a Voice-Only Interface for Finding Movies (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua Wissbroecker, F. Maxwell Harper</p>
    <p>The current generation of streaming media players often allow users to speak commands (e.g., users can change the TV channel by pressing a button and saying “ESPN”). However, these devices typically support a narrow range of control- and search-oriented commands, and do not support deeper recommendation or exploration queries. To study spoken natural language interactions with recommenders, we have built MovieLens TV, a movie recommender system with no input modalities except voice. In this poster, we describe MovieLens TV, with a focus on lessons learned building a prototype system around an off-the-shelf Amazon Echo.</p>

    <h3>pyRecLab: A Software Library for Quick Prototyping of Recommender Systems (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Parra, Gabriel Sepulveda</p>
    <p>This paper introduces pyRecLab, a software library written in C++ with Python bindings which allows to quickly train, test and develop recommender systems. Although there are several software libraries for this purpose, only a few let developers to get quickly started with the most traditional methods, permitting them to try different parameters and approach several tasks without a significant loss of performance. Among the few libraries that have all these features, they are available in languages such as Java, Scala or C#, what is a disadvantage for less experienced programmers more used to the popular Python programming language. In this article we introduce details of pyRecLab, showing as well performance analysis in terms of error metrics (MAE and RMSE) and train/test time. We benchmark it against the popular Java-based library LibRec, showing similar results. We expect programmers with little experience and people interested in quickly prototyping recommender systems to be benefited from pyRecLab.</p>

    <h3>Idomaar: A Framework for Multi-dimensional Benchmarking of Recommender Algorithms (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andras Sereny, Davide Malagoli, Till Plumbaum, Andreas Lommatzsch, Benjamin Kille, Martha Larson, Frank Hopfgartner, Mario Scriminaci</p>
    <p>In real-world scenarios, recommenders face non-functional requirements of technical nature and must handle dynamic data in the form of sequential streams. Evaluation of recommender systems must take these issues into account in order to be maximally informative. In this paper, we present a framework called Idomaar which enables the efficient multi-dimensional benchmarking of recommender algorithms. Idomaar goes beyond current academic research practices by creating a realistic evaluation environment and computing both effectiveness and technical metrics for stream-based as well as set based evaluation. The potentials of the framework are illustrated in a scenario that focuses on the “research to prototyping to productization” cycle at a company. We show that Idomaar simplifies the testing with different configurations and supports the flexible integration of different data.</p>
