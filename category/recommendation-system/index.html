    <h3>Integrating Offline Reinforcement Learning with Transformers for Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xumei Xi, Yang Wu, Liwen Ouyang, Yuke Zhao, Quan Liu</p>
    <p>We consider the problem of sequential recommendation, where the current recommendation is made based on past interactions. This recommendation task requires efficient processing of the sequential data and aims to provide recommendations that maximize the long-term reward. To this end, we train a farsighted recommender by using an offline RL algorithm with the policy network in our model architecture that has been initialized from a pre-trained transformer model. The pre-trained model leverages the superb ability of the transformer to process sequential information. Compared to prior works that rely on online interaction via simulation, we focus on implementing a fully offline RL framework that is able to converge in a fast and stable way. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we show that our method is robust across various recommendation regimes, including e-commerce and movie suggestions. Compared to state-of-the-art supervised learning algorithms, our algorithm yields recommendations of higher quality, demonstrating the clear advantage of combining RL and transformers.</p>

    <h3>Exploring Clustering of Bandits for Online Recommendation System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Xia, Qiang Yang, Bo Liu, Kai Chen, Leyu Lin, Liu Yang</p>
    <p>Cluster-of-bandit policy leverages contextual bandits in a collaborative filtering manner and aids personalized services in the online recommendation system (RecSys). When facing insufficient observations, the cluster-of-bandit policy could achieve more outstanding performance because of knowledge sharing. Cluster-of-bandit policy aims to maximize the cumulative feedback, e.g., clicks, from users. Nevertheless, in the way of their goal exist two kinds of uncertainties. First, cluster-of-bandit algorithms make recommendations according to their uncertain estimation of user interests. Second, cluster-of-bandit algorithms transfer relevant knowledge upon uncertain and noisy user clusters. Existing algorithms only consider the first one, while leaving the latter one untouched. To address the two challenges together, in this paper, we propose the ClexB policy for online RecSys. On the one hand, ClexB estimates user clustering more accurately and with less uncertainty via explorable-clustering. On the other hand, ClexB also exploits and explores user interests by sharing information within and among user clusters. In summary, ClexB explores knowledge transfer and further aids the inferences about user interests. Besides, we provide extensive empirical experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets and regret analysis, further consolidating the superiority of ClexB.</p>

    <h3>Deep Social Collaborative Filtering (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiliang Tang, Yao Ma, Dawei Yin, Jianping Wang, Wenqi Fan, Qing Li</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are crucial to alleviate the information overload problem in online worlds. Most of the modern recommender systems capture users’ preference towards items via their interactions based on collaborative filtering techniques. In addition to the user-item interactions, social networks can also provide useful information to understand users’ preference as suggested by the social theories such as homophily and influence. Recently, deep neural networks have been utilized for social recommendations, which facilitate both the user-item interactions and the social network information. However, most of these models cannot take full advantage of the social network information. They only use information from direct neighbors, but distant neighbors can also provide helpful information. Meanwhile, most of these models treat neighbors’ information equally without considering the specific recommendations. However, for a specific recommendation case, the information relevant to the specific item would be helpful. Besides, most of these models do not explicitly capture the neighbor’s opinions to items for social recommendations, while different opinions could affect the user differently. In this paper, to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose DSCF, a Deep Social Collaborative Filtering framework, which can exploit the social relations with various aspects for recommender systems. Comprehensive experiments on two-real world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

    <h3>AnnoMathTeX – a Formula Identifier Annotation Recommender System for STEM Documents (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bela Gipp, Corinna Breitinger, Joeran Beel, Ian Mackerracher, Philipp Scharpf, Moritz Schubotz</p>
    <p>Documents from science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) often contain a large number of mathematical formulae alongside text. Semantic search, recommender, and question answering systems require the occurring formula constants and variables (identifiers) to be disambiguated. We present a first implementation of a recommender system that enables and accelerates formula annotation by displaying the most likely candidates for formula and identifier names from four different sources (arXiv, Wikipedia, Wikidata, or the surrounding text). A first evaluation shows that in total, 78% of the formula identifier name recommendations were accepted by the user as a suitable annotation. Furthermore, document-wide annotation saved the user the annotation of ten times more other identifier occurrences. Our long-term vision is to integrate the annotation recommender into the edit-view of Wikipedia and the online LaTeX editor Overleaf.</p>

    <h3>ComfRide: A Smartphone based System for Comfortable Public Transport Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surjya Ghosh, Niloy Ganguly, Sandip Chakraborty, Bivas Mitra, Rohit Verma, Saketh Mahankali</p>
    <p>Passenger comfort is a major factor influencing a commuter’s decision to avail public transport. Existing studies suggest that factors like overcrowding, jerkiness, traffic congestion etc. correlate well to passenger’s (dis)comfort. An online survey conducted with more than 300 participants from 12 different countries reveals that different personalized and context dependent factors influence passenger comfort during a travel by public transport. Leveraging on these findings, we identify correlations between comfort level and these dynamic parameters, and implement a smartphone based application, ComfRide, which recommends the most comfortable route based on user’s preference honoring her travel time constraint. We use a ‘Dynamic Input/Output Automata’ based composition model to capture both the wide varieties of comfort choices from the commuters and the impact of environment on the comfort parameters. Evaluation of ComfRide, involving 50 participants over 28 routes in a state capital of India, reveals that recommended routes have on average 30% better comfort level than Google map recommended routes, when a commuter gives priority to specific comfort parameters of her choice.</p>

    <h3>An Insurance Recommendation System Using Bayesian Networks (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katie J. Meissner, Glenn M. Fung, Maleeha Qazi, Eduardo R. Fontes</p>
    <p>In this paper we describe a deployed recommender system to predict insurance products for new and existing customers. Our goal is to give our customers personalized recommendations based on what other similar people with similar portfolios have, in order to make sure they were adequately covered for their needs. Our system uses customer characteristics in addition to customer portfolio data. Since the number of possible recommendable products is relatively small compared to other recommender domains and missing data is relatively frequent, we chose to use Bayesian Networks for modeling our system. Experimental results show advantages of using probabilistic graphical models over the widely used low-rank matrix factorization model for the insurance domain.</p>

    <h3>Towards a Recommender System for Undergraduate Research (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Del Rio, Denis Parra, Erick Svec, Jovan Kuzmicic</p>
    <p>Several studies indicate that attracting students to research careers requires to engage them from early undergraduate years. Following this, the Engineering School at PUC Chile has developed an undergraduate research program that allows students to enroll in research in exchange for course credits. Moreover, we developed a web portal to inform students about the program, but participation remains lower than expected. In order to promote student engagement, we attempt to build a personalized recommender system of research opportunities to undergraduates. With this goal in mind we investigate two tasks. First, identifying students that are more willing to participate on this kind of program. A second task is generating a personalized list of recommendations of research opportunities for each student. To evaluate our approach, we perform a simulated prediction experiment with data from our school, which has more than 4,000 active undergraduate students nowadays. Results indicate that there is a big potential to create a personalized recommender system for this purpose. Our research can be used as a baseline for colleges seeking strategies to encourage research activities within undergraduate students.</p>

    <h3>Vista: A Visually, Socially, and Temporally-aware Model for Artistic Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaowen Wang, Ruining He, Chen Fang, Julian McAuley</p>
    <p>Understanding users’ interactions with highly subjective content—like artistic images—is challenging due to the complex semantics that guide our preferences. On the one hand one has to overcome `standard’ recommender systems challenges, such as dealing with large, sparse, and long-tailed datasets. On the other, several new challenges present themselves, such as the need to model content in terms of its visual appearance, or even social dynamics, such as a preference toward a particular artist that is independent of the art they create. In this paper we build large-scale recommender systems to model the dynamics of a vibrant digital art community, Behance, consisting of tens of millions of interactions (clicks and `appreciates’) of users toward digital art. Methodologically, our main contributions are to model (a) rich content, especially in terms of its visual appearance; (b) temporal dynamics, in terms of how users prefer `visually consistent’ content within and across sessions; and (c) social dynamics, in terms of how users exhibit preferences both towards certain art styles, as well as the artists themselves.</p>

    <h3>An Entity Graph Based Recommender System (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amos Azaria, Sneha Chaudhari, Tom Mitchell</p>
    <p>We propose a recommender system which exploits relations present between entities appearing in content from user’s history and entities appearing in candidate content. In order to identify such relations, we use the knowledge graph of NELL, which encodes entities and their relations. We present a novel normalized version of Personalized PageRank, to rank candidate content. We test our approach on the movie recommendation domain and show that the proposed method outperforms other baseline methods, including the standard Personalized PageRank.</p>

    <h3>Style Recommendation for Fashion Items using Heterogeneous Information Network (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang-Goo Lee, Hanbit Lee</p>
    <p>In the midst of vast amounts of available fashion items, consumers today require more efficient recommendation services. A system that sorts out items that form a stylish ensemble with already selected or possessed items would provide them with greater convenience. In this paper, we propose a fashion item recommendation method that learns the way the fashion items are matched from a large ensemble database. We empirically show that the proposed method can explain factors that affect item matching and recommend the most suitable items to the given set of items.</p>

    <h3>Image Discovery and Insertion for Custom Publishing (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerry Liu, Shanchan Wu, Lei Liu</p>
    <p>Images in reading materials make the content come alive. Aside from providing additional information to the text, reading material containing illustration engages our spatial memory, increases memory retention of the material. However, despite the plethora of available multimedia, adding illustrations to text continues to be a difficult task for the amateur content publisher. To address this problem, we present a semantic-aware image discovery and insertion system for custom publishing. Compared to image search engines, our system has the advantage of being able to discern among different topics within a long text passage and recommend the most relevant images for each detected topic with semantic “visual words” based relevance.</p>
