    <h3>Transfer Learning in Collaborative Recommendation for Bias Reduction (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weike Pan, Dugang Liu, Zinan Lin, Zhong Ming</p>
    <p>In a recommender system, a user’s interaction is often biased by the items’ displaying positions and popularity, as well as the user’s self-selection. Most existing recommendation models are built using such a biased user-system interaction data. In this paper, we first additionally introduce a specially collected unbiased data and then propose a novel transfer learning solution, i.e., transfer via joint reconstruction (TJR), to achieve knowledge transfer and sharing between the biased data and unbiased data. Specifically, in our TJR, we refine the prediction via the latent features containing bias information in order to obtain a more accurate and unbiased prediction. Moreover, we integrate the two data by reconstructing their interaction in a joint learning manner. We then adopt three representative methods as the backbone models of our TJR and conduct extensive empirical studies on two public datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of our transfer learning solution over some very competitive baselines.</p>

    <h3>Eliciting Pairwise Preferences in Recommender Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Ricci, Saikishore Kalloori, Rosella Gennari</p>
    <p>Preference data in the form of ratings or likes for items are widely used in many Recommender Systems (RSs). However, previous research has shown that even item comparisons, which generate pairwise preference data, can be used to model user preferences. Moreover, pairwise preferences can be effectively combined with ratings to compute recommendations. In such hybrid approaches, the RS requires to elicit from the user both types of preference data. In this work, we aim at identifying how and when to elicit pairwise preferences, i.e., when this form of user preference data is more meaningful for the user to express and more beneficial for the system. We conducted an online A/B test and compared a rating-only based system variant with another variant that allows the user to enter both types of preferences. Our results demonstrate that pairwise preferences are valuable and useful especially when the user is focusing on a specific type of items and by incorporating pairwise preferences, the system can generate better recommendations than a state of the art rating-only based solution. Additionally, our results indicate that there exists a dependency between the user’s personality and the perceived system usability and the satisfaction for the preference elicitation procedure, which varies if only ratings or a combination of ratings and pairwise preferences are elicited.</p>

    <h3>Practical Lessons from Developing a Large-Scale Recommender System at Zalando (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonino Freno</p>
    <p>Developing a real-world recommender system, i.e. for use in large-scale online retail, poses a number of different challenges. Interestingly, only a small part of these challenges are of algorithmic nature, such as how to select the most accurate model for a given use case. Instead, most technical problems usually arise from operational constraints, such as: adaptation to novel use cases; cost and complexity of system maintenance; capability of reusing pre-existing signal and integrating heterogeneous data sources. In this paper, we describe the system we developed in order to address those constraints at Zalando, which is one of the most popular online fashion retailers in Europe. In particular, we explain how moving from a collaborative filtering approach to a learning-to-rank model helped us to effectively tackle the challenges mentioned above, while improving at the same time the quality of our recommendations. A fairly detailed description of our software architecture is provided, along with an overview of the algorithmic approach. On the other hand, we present some of the offline and online experiments that we ran in order to validate our models.</p>

    <h3>Idomaar: A Framework for Multi-dimensional Benchmarking of Recommender Algorithms (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andras Sereny, Davide Malagoli, Till Plumbaum, Andreas Lommatzsch, Benjamin Kille, Martha Larson, Frank Hopfgartner, Mario Scriminaci</p>
    <p>In real-world scenarios, recommenders face non-functional requirements of technical nature and must handle dynamic data in the form of sequential streams. Evaluation of recommender systems must take these issues into account in order to be maximally informative. In this paper, we present a framework called Idomaar which enables the efficient multi-dimensional benchmarking of recommender algorithms. Idomaar goes beyond current academic research practices by creating a realistic evaluation environment and computing both effectiveness and technical metrics for stream-based as well as set based evaluation. The potentials of the framework are illustrated in a scenario that focuses on the “research to prototyping to productization” cycle at a company. We show that Idomaar simplifies the testing with different configurations and supports the flexible integration of different data.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation with the Right Slice: Speeding Up Collaborative Filtering with Factorization Machines (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Babak Loni, Alan Hanjalic, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Martha Larson</p>
    <p>We propose an alternative way to efficiently exploit rating data for collaborative filtering with Factorization Machines (FMs). Our approach partitions user-item matrix into ‘slices’ which are mutually exclusive with respect to items. The training phase makes direct use of the slice of interest ( slice), while incorporating information from other slices indirectly. FMs represent user-item interactions as feature vectors, and they offer the advantage of easy incorporation of complementary information. We exploit this advantage to integrate information from other slices. We demonstrate, using experiments on two benchmark datasets, that improved performance can be achieved, while the time complexity of training can be reduced significantly.</p>
