    <h3>Large Language Models as Evaluators for Recommendation Explanations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yishan Li, Bowen Sun, Weizhi Ma, Peijie Sun, Xiaoyu Zhang, Min Zhang, Jiayin Wang</p>
    <p>The explainability of recommender systems has attracted significant attention in academia and industry. Many efforts have been made for explainable recommendations, yet evaluating the quality of the explanations remains a challenging and unresolved issue. In recent years, leveraging LLMs as evaluators presents a promising avenue in Natural Language Processing tasks (e.g., sentiment classification, information extraction), as they perform strong capabilities in instruction following and common-sense reasoning. However, evaluating recommendation explanatory texts is different from these NLG tasks, as its criteria are related to human perceptions and are usually subjective. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can serve as evaluators of recommendation explanations. To answer the question, we utilize real user feedback on explanations given from previous work and additionally collect third-party annotations and LLM evaluations. We design and apply a 3-level meta-evaluation strategy to measure the correlation between evaluator labels and the ground truth provided by users. Our experiments reveal that LLMs, such as GPT4, can provide comparable evaluations with appropriate prompts and settings. We also provide further insights into combining human labels with the LLM evaluation process and utilizing ensembles of multiple heterogeneous LLM evaluators to enhance the accuracy and stability of evaluations. Our study verifies that utilizing LLMs as evaluators can be an accurate, reproducible and cost-effective solution for evaluating recommendation explanation texts.

    <h3>Towards Empathetic Conversational Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingfei Liang, Yougang Lyu, Zhaochun Ren, Zhanhui Kang, Pengjie Ren, Xin Xin, Xiaoyu Zhang, Bo Zhang, Maarten de Rijke, Ruobing Xie</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) are able to elicit user preferences through multi-turn dialogues. They typically incorporate external knowledge and pre-trained language models to capture the dialogue context. Most CRS approaches, trained on benchmark datasets, assume that the standard items and responses in these benchmarks are optimal. However, they overlook that users may express negative emotions with the standard items and may not feel emotionally engaged by the standard responses. This issue leads to a tendency to replicate the logic of recommenders in the dataset instead of aligning with user needs. To remedy this misalignment, we introduce empathy within a CRS. With empathy we refer to a systemâ€™s ability to capture and express emotions. We propose an empathetic conversational recommender (ECR) framework. ECR contains two main modules: emotion-aware item recommendation and emotion-aligned response generation. Specifically, we employ user emotions to refine user preference modeling for accurate recommendations. To generate human-like emotional responses, ECR applies retrieval-augmented prompts to fine-tune a pre-trained language model aligning with emotions and mitigating hallucination. To address the challenge of insufficient supervision labels, we enlarge our empathetic data using emotion labels annotated by large language models and emotional reviews collected from external resources. We propose novel evaluation metrics to capture user satisfaction in real-world CRS scenarios. Our experiments on the ReDial dataset validate the efficacy of our framework in enhancing recommendation accuracy and improving user satisfaction.</p>
