    <h3>Personalizing Benefits Allocation Without Spending Money (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmitri Goldenberg</p>
    <p>Modern e-commerce platforms make use of promotional offers such as discounts and rewards to encourage customers to complete purchases. While offering the promotions has a great effect on the sales, it also generates a monetary loss. By utilizing causal machine learning and optimization, our team at Booking.com was able to personalize the promotions allocation to customers, while efficiently controlling the spend within a given budget. In this talk we’ll share the personalized promotion assignment techniques, such as uplift modeling and constrained optimization, which helped us to predict the outcomes of discounts offering and allocate them efficiently. This solution allowed us to unlock promotional campaigns to bring more value to the customers and grow our business.</p>

    <h3>Recommending for a Multi-Sided Marketplace with Heterogeneous Contents (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian Xing Zhang, Yuyan Wang, Long Tao</p>
    <p>Many online personalization platforms today are recommending heterogeneous contents in a multi-sided marketplace consisting of consumers, merchants and other partners. For a recommender system to be successful in these contexts, it faces two main challenges. First, each side in the marketplace has different and potentially conflicting utilities. Recommending for a multi-sided marketplace therefore entails jointly optimizing multiple objectives with trade-offs. Second, the off-the-shelf recommendation algorithms are not applicable to the heterogeneous content space, where a recommendation item could be an aggregation of other recommendation items. In this work, we develop a general framework for recommender systems in a multi-sided marketplace with heterogeneous and hierarchical contents. We propose a constrained optimization framework with machine learning models for each objective as inputs, and a probabilistic structural model for users’ engagement patterns on heterogeneous contents. Our proposed structural modeling approach ensures consistent user experience across different levels of aggregation of the contents, and provides levels of transparency to the merchants and content providers. We further develop an efficient optimization solution for ranking and recommendation in large-scale online systems in real time. We implement the framework at Uber Eats, one of the largest online food delivery platforms in the world and a three-sided marketplace consisting of eaters, restaurant partners and delivery partners. Online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in ranking heterogeneous contents and optimizing for the three sides in the marketplace. Our framework has been deployed globally as the recommendation algorithm for Uber Eats’ homepage.</p>

    <h3>A Constrained Optimization Approach for Calibrated Recommendations (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sinan Seymen, Himan Abdollahpouri, Edward C. Malthouse</p>
    <p>In recommender systems (RS) it is important to ensure that the various (past) areas of interest of a user are reflected with their corresponding proportions in the recommendation lists. In other words, when a user has watched, say, 60 romance movies and 40 Comedy movies, then it is reasonable to expect the personalized list of recommended movies to contain about 60% romance and 40% comedy movies as well. This property is known as calibration, and it has recently received much attention in the RS community. Greedy heuristic approaches have been proposed to calibrate recommendations, and although they provide great improvements, they can result in inefficient solutions in that a better one can be missed because of the myopic nature of these algorithms. This paper addresses the calibration problem from a constrained optimization perspective and provides a model to combine both accuracy and calibration. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristics for calibration in most cases on both accuracy of the recommendations and the level of calibrations the recommendation lists achieve. We give a small example to illustrate why the heuristic fails to find the optimal solution.</p>
