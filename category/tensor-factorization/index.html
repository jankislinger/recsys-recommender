    <h3>Adversarial Tensor Factorization for Context-aware Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huiyuan Chen, Jing Li</p>
    <p>Contextual factors such as time, location, or tag, can affect user preferences for a particular item. Context-aware recommendations are thus critical to improve both quality and explainability of recommender systems, compared to traditional recommendations solely based on user-item interactions. Tensor factorization machines have achieved state-of-the-art performance  due to their generic integration of users, items, and contextual factors in one unify way. However,  few work has focused on the robustness of a context-aware recommender system. Improving the robustness of a tensor-based model is challenging due to the sparsity of the observed tensor and the multi-linear nature of tensor factorization. In this paper, we propose ATF, a model that combines tensor factorization and adversarial learning for context-aware recommendations. Doing so allows us to reap the benefits of tensor factorization, while enhancing the robustness of a recommender model, and thus improves its performance. Empirical studies on two real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms standard tensor-based  methods. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Metalearning for Context-aware Filtering: Selection of Tensor Factorization Algorithms (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiago Cunha, André C.P.L.F. de Carvalho, Carlos Soares</p>
    <p>This work addresses the problem of selecting Tensor Factorization algorithms for the Context-aware Filtering recommendation task using a metalearning approach. The most important challenge of applying metalearning on new problems is the development of useful measures able to characterize the data, i.e. metafeatures. We propose an extensive and exhaustive set of metafeatures to characterize Context-aware Filtering recommendation task. These metafeatures take advantage of the tensor’s hierarchical structure via slice operations. The algorithm selection task is addressed as a Label Ranking problem, which ranks the Tensor Factorization algorithms according to their expected performance, rather than simply selecting the algorithm that is expected to obtain the best performance. A comprehensive experimental work is conducted on both levels, baselevel and metalevel (Tensor Factorization and Label Ranking, respectively). The results show that the proposed metafeatures lead to metamodels that tend to rank Tensor Factorization algorithms accurately and that the selected algorithms present high recommendation performance.</p>

    <h3>Addressing Cold Start for Next-song Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Hsuan Yang, Jyh-Shing Roger Jang, Szu-Yu Chou, Yu-Ching Lin</p>
    <p>The cold start problem arises in various recommendation applications. In this paper, we propose a tensor factorization-based algorithm that exploits content features extracted from music audio to deal with the cold start problem for the emerging application next-song recommendation. Specifically, the new algorithm learns sequential behavior to predict the next song that a user would be interested in based on the last song the user just listened to. A unique characteristic of the algorithm is that it learns and updates the mapping between the audio feature space and the item latent space each time during the iterations of the factorization process. This way, the content features can be better exploited in forming the latent features for both users and items, leading to more effective solutions for cold-start recommendation. Evaluation on a large-scale music recommendation dataset shows that the recommendation result of the proposed algorithm exhibits not only higher accuracy but also better novelty and diversity, suggesting its applicability in helping a user explore new items in next-item recommendation. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/fearofchou/ALMM.</p>

    <h3>TAPER: A Contextual Tensor-Based Approach for Personalized Expert Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hancheng Ge, Haokai Lu, James Caverlee</p>
    <p>We address the challenge of personalized recommendation of high quality content producers in social media. While some candidates are easily identifiable (say, by being “favorited” many times), there is a long-tail of potential candidates for whom we have little evidence. Through careful modeling of contextual factors like the geo-spatial, topical, and social preferences of users, we propose a tensor-based personalized expert recommendation framework that integrates these factors for revealing latent connections between homogeneous entities (e.g., users and users) and between heterogeneous entities (e.g., users and experts). Through extensive experiments over geo-tagged Twitter data, we find that the proposed framework can improve the quality of recommendation by over 30% in both precision and recall compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

    <h3>Fifty Shades of Ratings: How to Benefit from a Negative Feedback in Top-N Recommendations Tasks (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evgeny Frolov, Ivan Oseledets</p>
    <p>Conventional collaborative filtering techniques treat a top-n recommendations problem as a task of generating a list of the most relevant items. This formulation, however, disregards an opposite — avoiding recommendations with completely irrelevant items. Due to that bias, standard algorithms, as well as commonly used evaluation metrics, become insensitive to negative feedback. In order to resolve this problem we propose to treat user feedback as a categorical variable and model it with users and items in a ternary way. We employ a third-order tensor factorization technique and implement a higher order folding-in method to support online recommendations. The method is equally sensitive to entire spectrum of user ratings and is able to accurately predict relevant items even from a negative only feedback. Our method may partially eliminate the need for complicated rating elicitation process as it provides means for personalized recommendations from the very beginning of an interaction with a recommender system. We also propose a modification of standard metrics which helps to reveal unwanted biases and account for sensitivity to a negative feedback. Our model achieves state-of-the-art quality in standard recommendation tasks while significantly outperforming other methods in the cold-start “no-positive-feedback” scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Modeling the Dynamics of User Preferences in Coupled Tensor Factorization (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandros Nanopoulos, Dimitrios Rafailidis</p>
    <p>In several applications, user preferences can be fairly dynamic, since users tend to exploit a wide range of items and modify their tastes accordingly over time. In this paper, we model continuous user-item interactions over time using a tensor that has time as a dimension (mode). To account for the fact that user preferences are dynamic and change individually, we propose a new measure of user-preference dynamics (UPD) that captures the rate with which the current preferences of each user have been shifted. We generate recommendations based on factorizing the tensor, by weighting the importance of past user preferences according to their UPD values. We additionally exploit users’ side data, such as demographics, which can help improving the accuracy of recommendations based on a coupled, tensor-matrix factorization scheme. Our empirical evaluation uses a real data set from last.fm, which allows us to demonstrate that user preferences can become very dynamic. Our experimental results show that the proposed method, by taking into account these dynamics, outperforms several baselines.</p>
