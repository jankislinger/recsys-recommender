    <h3>Variational Low Rank Multinomials for Collaborative Filtering with Side-Information (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ehtsham Elahi, Dave Ray, Aish Fenton, Wei Wang, Tony Jebara</p>
    <p>We are interested in Bayesian models for collaborative filtering that incorporate side-information or metadata about items in addition to user-item interaction data. We present a simple and flexible framework to build models for this task that exploit the low-rank structure in user-item interaction datasets. Although the resulting models are non-conjugate, we develop an efficient technique for approximating posteriors over model parameters using variational inference. We borrow the ‘re-parameterization trick’ from Bayesian deep learning literature to enable variational inference in our models. The resulting approximate Bayesian inference algorithm is scalable and can handle large scale datasets. We demonstrate our ideas on three real world datasets where we show competitive performance against widely used baselines</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Poisson Factorization (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David M. Blei, Laurent Charlin, James McInerney, Rajesh Ranganath</p>
    <p>Models for recommender systems use latent factors to explain the preferences and behaviors of users with respect to a set of items (e.g., movies, books, academic papers). Typically, the latent factors are assumed to be static and, given these factors, the observed preferences and behaviors of users are assumed to be generated without order. These assumptions limit the explorative and predictive capabilities of such models, since users’ interests and item popularity may evolve over time. To address this, we propose dPF, a dynamic matrix factorization model based on the recent Poisson factorization model for recommendations. dPF models the time evolving latent factors with a Kalman filter and the actions with Poisson distributions. We derive a scalable variational inference algorithm to infer the latent factors. Finally, we demonstrate dPF on 10 years of user click data from arXiv.org, one of the largest repository of scientific papers and a formidable source of information about the behavior of scientists. Empirically we show performance improvement over both static and, more recently proposed, dynamic recommendation models. We also provide a thorough exploration of the inferred posteriors over the latent variables.</p>

    <h3>Bayesian Binomial Mixture Model for Collaborative Prediction with Non-Random Missing Data (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seungjin Choi, Yong-Deok Kim</p>
    <p>In real-world datasets, the presence of a certain amount of missing data is inevitable. If the data is not missing at random (MAR), the missing mechanism can not be ignored, and has to be modelled precisely as to obtain correct results. However, although there are strong possibilities of violation of MAR assumption on rating datasets collected from recommendation systems, most prior researches on collaborative prediction ignore the missing data mechanism. Exceptions are recent works on multinomial mixture model with CPT-v and Logit-vd, which employ conditional Bernoulli selection models for the response variables. In this paper, we present a Bayesian binomial mixture model for collaborative prediction with non-random missing data. We consider three factors for reason of observation: user, item, and rating value. Each factor is modelled by Bernoulli random variable, and the observation of rating is determined by the OR operation of three binary variables. Because of the property of OR operation, one of three factors can override others, hence it naturally models the 80-20 rule, which commonly arise in the recommendation systems. We develop efficient variational inference algorithms with closed-form update rules for all variational parameters, where the computational complexity depends on the number of observation, not on the size of the rating data matrix. Finally, we present experimental results showing that 1) binomial mixture model is more suitable than multinomial mixture model for modelling discrete, finite, and ordered rating values; 2) our model find meaningful solutions instead of boundary solutions, if hyper-parameters are estimated by empirical Bayes; 3) our model can capture different rating trend between domain (e.g. songs and movies).</p>
