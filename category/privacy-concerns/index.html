    <h3>A New Perspective in Health Recommendations: Integration of Human Pose Estimation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaetano Dibenedetto</p>
    <p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in multimodal and multi-source data due to their ability to introduce heterogeneous information. Studies have demonstrated that combining such information enhances the performance of Recommender Systems across various scenarios. In the context of Health Recommendation Systems (HRS), different types of data are utilized, primarily focusing on patient-based information, but data from Pose Estimations (PE) are not incorporated. The objective of my Ph.D. is to investigate methods to design and develop HRS that treat the PE as one of the input sources, taking into account aspects such as privacy concerns and balancing the trade-off between system quality and responsiveness. By leveraging the combination of diverse information sources, I intend to create a new model in the area of HRS capable of providing more precise and explainable recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Data Masking for Recommender Systems: Prediction Performance and Rating Hiding (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martha Larson, Alan Hanjalic, Manel Slokom</p>
    <p>Data science challenges allow companies, and other data holders, to collaborate with the wider research community. In the area of recommender systems, the potential of such challenges to move forward the state of the art is limited due to concerns about releasing user interaction data. This paper investigates the potential of privacy-preserving data publishing for supporting recommender system challenges. We propose a data masking algorithm, Shuffle-NNN, with two steps: Neighborhood selection and value swapping. Neighborhood selection preserves valuable item similarity information. The data shuffling technique hides (ie, changes) ratings of users for individual items. Our experimental results demonstrate that the relative performance of algorithms, which is the key property that a data science challenge must measure, is comparable between the original data and the data masked with Shuffle-NNN.</p>

    <h3>Efficient Privacy-Preserving Recommendations based on Social Graphs (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jörg Daubert, Aidmar Wainakh, Tim Grube, Max Mühlhäuser</p>
    <p>Many recommender systems use association rules mining, a technique that captures relations between user interests and recommends new probable ones accordingly. Applying association rule mining causes privacy concerns as user interests may contain sensitive personal information (e.g., political views). This potentially even inhibits the user from providing information in the first place. Current distributed privacy-preserving association rules mining (PPARM) approaches use cryptographic primitives that come with high computational and communication costs, rendering PPARM unsuitable for large-scale applications such as social networks. We propose improvements on the efficiency and the privacy of PPARM approaches by minimizing the required data. We propose and compare sampling strategies to sample the data based on social graphs in a privacy-preserving manner. The results on real-world datasets show that our sampling-based approach can achieve a high average precision score with as low as 50% sampling rate and, therefore, with a 50% reduction of communication cost.</p>

    <h3>Surveying User Reactions to Recommendations Based on Inferences Made by Face Detection Technology (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jason Wiese, Jennifer Marlow</p>
    <p>It is increasingly possible to use cameras and sensors to detect and analyze human appearance for the purposes of personalizing user experiences. Such systems are already deployed in some public places to personalize advertisements and recommend items. However, since these technologies are not yet widespread, we do not have a good sense of the perceived benefits and drawbacks of public display systems that use face detection as an input for personalized recommendations. We conducted a user study with a system that inferred a user’s gender and age from a facial detection and analysis algorithm and used this to present recommendations in two scenarios (finding stores to visit in a mall and finding a pair of sunglasses to buy).  This work provides an initial step towards understanding user reactions to a new and emerging form of implicit recommendation based on physical appearance.</p>

    <h3>Tell Me Where to Go and What to Do Next, but Do Not Bother Me (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Liu, Gang Wu</p>
    <p>In this demonstration, we present a system that recommends to the user the locations and activities she/he might be interested in according to history GPS trajectories and public places of interest (POI) data. Its innovation lies in the acceptable performance of recommendations in cases where no user comments on activity types are available. Such situations are more realistic considering the restrictions on mobile devices' abilities, users' privacies, or business secret. For this purpose, we first extract stay points according to uses' trajectories, and label them with the top-k common activities which have the most possibility in terms of the POI dataset. Then, by taking stay points as observations, and activities as hidden states, a Hidden Markov model is built to learn the transfer possibilities between activities and the generation probabilities between activities and stay points. Finally, with the obtained model, our system can perform two types of recommendation, i.e. the history based recommendation and the similarity based recommendation. The results of former type are those stay points from user's own history positions. While, the latter one conducts collaborative filtering by taking history based recommendation results from similar users. The demonstration shows the running effects of the implemented prototype system, in which the Microsoft GeoLife trajectories dataset and the "DianPing.com" POI dataset were loaded. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate the feasibility.</p>
