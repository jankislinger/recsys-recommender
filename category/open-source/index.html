    <h3>Democratizing Urban Mobility Through an Open-Source, Multi-Criteria Route Recommendation System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Eggerth, Javier Argota Sánchez-Vaquerizo, Sachit Mahajan, Dirk Helbing</p>
    <p>Urban navigation systems traditionally optimize for efficiency, thereby overlooking environmental factors and personal preferences. This paper introduces Routify, a novel multi-criteria recommender system for personalized urban route selection. Routify advances the state-of-the-art in route recommendation through: (1) integration of diverse environmental data (air quality, noise levels, green spaces) with real-time IoT inputs; (2) a dynamic weighting algorithm allowing fine-grained user control over routing parameters; (3) transparent decision-making via an interactive interface displaying edge-level information; and (4) a community-driven feedback mechanism that continuously refines recommendations. We have implemented Routify as an open-source platform, facilitating further research and development. Experimental results from 1000 origin-destination pairs demonstrate significant improvements in user-defined environmental metrics (up to 32.98% increase in green index for walking and 16.91% reduction in noise levels for cycling) compared to traditional routing systems. These improvements come with slight trade-offs in distance, especially in walking mode. Our research contributes a comprehensive framework for multi-criteria route recommendation, balancing individual preferences, environmental factors, and community insights in urban navigation.</p>

    <h3>Informfully – Research Platform for Reproducible User Studies (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian A. Croci, Madhav Sachdeva, Abraham Bernstein, Lucien Heitz</p>
    <p>This paper presents Informfully, a research platform for content distribution and user studies. Informfully allows to push algorithmically curated text, image, audio, and video content to users and automatically generates a detailed log of their consumption history. As such, it serves as an open-source platform for conducting user experiments to investigate the impact of item recommendations on users’ consumption behavior. The platform was designed to accommodate different experiment types through versatility, ease of use, and scalability. It features three core components: 1) a front end for displaying and interacting with recommended items, 2) a back end for researchers to create and maintain user experiments, and 3) a simple JSON-based exchange format for ranked item recommendations  to interface with third-party frameworks. We provide a system overview and outline the three core components of the platform. A sample workflow is shown for conducting field studies incorporating multiple user groups, personalizing recommendations, and measuring the effect of algorithms on user engagement. We present evidence for the versatility, ease of use, and scalability of Informfully by showcasing previous studies that used our platform.</p>

    <h3>Reproducibility Analysis of Recommender Systems relying on Visual Features: traps, pitfalls, and countermeasures (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elio Musacchio, Marco Polignano, Antonio Silletti, Pasquale Lops, Giovanni Semeraro, Cataldo Musto</p>
    <p>Reproducibility is an important requirement for scientific progress, and the lack of reproducibility for a large amount of published research can hinder the progress over the state-of-the-art. This concerns several research areas, and recommender systems are witnessing the same reproducibility crisis. Even solid works published at prestigious venues might not be reproducible for several reasons: data might not be public, source code for recommendation algorithms might not be available or well documented, and evaluation metrics might be computed using parameters not explicitly provided. In addition, recommendation pipelines are becoming increasingly complex due to the use of deep neural architectures or representations for multimodal side information involving text, images, audio, or video. This makes the reproducibility of experiments even more challenging. In this work, we describe an extension of an already existing open-source recommendation framework, called ClayRS, with the aim of providing the foundation for future reproducibility of recommendation processes involving images as side information. This extension, called ClayRS Can See, is the starting point for reproducing state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms exploiting images. We have provided our implementation of one of these algorithms, namely VBPR – Visual Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback, and we have discussed all the issues related to the reproducibility of the study to deeply understand the main traps and pitfalls, along with solutions to deal with such complex environments. We conclude the work by proposing a checklist for recommender systems reproducibility as a guide for the research community.</p>

    <h3>Reproducibility of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning Recommendation: Interplay between Effectiveness and Beyond-Accuracy Perspectives (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Paparella, Ludovico Boratto, Vito Walter Anelli, Tommaso Di Noia</p>
    <p>Providing effective suggestions is of predominant importance for successful Recommender Systems (RSs). Nonetheless, the need of accounting for additional multiple objectives has become prominent, from both the final users’ and the item providers’ points of view. This need has led to a new class of RSs, called Multi-Objective Recommender Systems (MORSs). These systems are designed to provide suggestions by considering multiple (conflicting) objectives simultaneously, such as diverse, novel, and fairness-aware recommendations. In this work, we reproduce a state-of-the-art study on MORSs that exploits a reinforcement learning agent to satisfy three objectives, i.e., accuracy, diversity, and novelty of recommendations. The selected study is one of the few MORSs where the source code and datasets are released to ensure the reproducibility of the proposed approach. Interestingly, we find that some challenges arise when replicating the results of the original work, due to the nature of multiple-objective problems. We also extend the evaluation of the approach to analyze the impact of improving user-centred objectives of recommendations (i.e., diversity and novelty) in terms of algorithmic bias. To this end, we take into consideration both popularity and category of the items. We discover some interesting trends in the recommendation performance according to different evaluation metrics. In addition, we see that the multi-objective reinforcement learning approach is responsible for increasing the bias disparity in the output of the recommendation algorithm for those items belonging to positively/negatively biased categories. We publicly release datasets and codes in the following GitHub repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MORS_reproducibility-BD60</p>

    <h3>RecAD: Towards A Unified Library for Recommender Attack and Defense (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chongming Gao, Wenjie Wang, Jianbai Ye, Xiangnan He, Changsheng Wang, Fuli Feng</p>
    <p>In recent years, recommender systems have become a ubiquitous part of our daily lives, while they suffer from a high risk of being attacked due to the growing commercial and social values. Despite significant research progress in recommender attack and defense, there is a lack of a widely-recognized benchmarking standard in the field, leading to unfair performance comparison and limited credibility of experiments. To address this, we propose RecAD, a unified library aiming at establishing an open benchmark for recommender attack and defense. RecAD takes an initial step to set up a unified benchmarking pipeline for reproducible research by integrating diverse datasets, standard source codes, hyper-parameter settings, running logs, attack knowledge, attack budget, and evaluation results. The benchmark is designed to be comprehensive and sustainable, covering both attack, defense, and evaluation tasks, enabling more researchers to easily follow and contribute to this promising field. RecAD will drive more solid and reproducible research on recommender systems attack and defense, reduce the redundant efforts of researchers, and ultimately increase the credibility and practical value of recommender attack and defense. The project and documents are released at https://github.com/gusye1234/recad.</p>

    <h3>RepSys: Framework for Interactive Evaluation of Recommender Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel Kordík, Jan Šafařík, Vojtěch Vančura</p>
    <p>Making recommender systems more transparent and auditable is crucial for the future adoption of these systems. Available tools typically present mostly errors of models aggregated over all test users, which is often insufficient to uncover hidden biases and problems. Moreover, the emphasis is primarily on the accuracy of recommendations but less on other important metrics, such as the diversity of recommended items, the extent of catalog coverage, or the opportunity to discover novel items at bestsellers’ expense. In this work, we propose RepSys, a framework for evaluating recommender systems. Our work offers a set of highly interactive approaches for investigating various scenario recommendations, analyzing a dataset, and evaluating distributions of various metrics that combine visualization techniques with existing offline evaluation methods. RepSys framework is available under an open-source license to other researchers.</p>

    <h3>A Federated Recommender System for Online Services (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Tan, Qiang Yang, Vincent Zheng, Bo Liu</p>
    <p>Due to privacy and security constraints, directly sharing user data between parties is undesired. Such decentralized data silo issues commonly exist in recommender systems. In general, recommender systems are data-driven. The more data it uses, the better performance it obtains. The data silo issues is a severe limitation of the recommender’s performance. Federated learning is an emerging technology, which bridges the data silos and builds machine learning models without compromising user privacy and data security. We design a recommender system based on federated learning. It is known as the federated recommender system. The system implements plenty of popular algorithms to support various online recommendation services. The algorithm implementation is open-sourced. We also deploy the system on a real-world content recommendation application, achieving significant performance improvement. In this demonstration, we present the architecture of the federated recommender system and give an online demo to show its detailed working procedures and results in content recommendations.</p>

    <h3>DRecPy: A Python Framework for Developing Deep Learning-Based Recommenders (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Márcia Barros, Francisco M. Couto, Fábio Colaço</p>
    <p>Frameworks that aid the development of Recommender Systems (RSs) are extremely important, since they reduce their development cost by offering reusable tools, as well as implementations of common strategies and popular models. However, it is still hard to find a framework that also provides full abstraction over data set conversion, support for deep learning-based approaches, extensible models and reproducible evaluations. This work introduces a new framework that not only provides several modules to avoid repetitive development work, but also to assist practitioners with these existing challenges. Our evaluation procedure ensures that RSs developed using this new approach are consistent and extensible, by analysing their predictive performance and certain characteristics of their implementation.</p>

    <h3>rrecsys: an R-package for prototyping recommendation algorithms (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Zanker, Ludovik Çoba</p>
    <p>We introduce rrecsys, an open source extension package in R for rapid prototyping and intuitive assessment of recommender system algorithms. As the only currently available R package for recommender algorithms (recommenderlab) did not include popular algorithm implementations such as matrix factorization or One-class Collaborative Filtering algorithms we developed rrecsys as an easily accessible tool that can, for instance, be employed for interactive demonstrations when teaching. This package replicates state-of-the-art Collaborative Filtering algorithms for rating and binary data and we compare results with the Java-based LensKit implementation and recommederlab for the purpose of benchmarking the implementation. Therefore this work can also be seen as a contribution in the context of replication of algorithm implementations and reproduction of evaluation results.</p>
