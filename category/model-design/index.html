    <h3>DNS-Rec: Data-aware Neural Architecture Search for Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Zhang, Xiangyu Zhao, Ruocheng Guo, Sheng Zhang, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu, Yao Zhao, Hongzhi Yin, Maolin Wang</p>
    <p>In the era of data proliferation, efficiently sifting through vast information to extract meaningful insights has become increasingly crucial. This paper addresses the computational and resource inefficiencies prevalent in existing Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs). However, existing SRSs are often plagued by significant computational overhead and resource inefficiency during the inference stage. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative approach combining pruning methods with advanced model designs. Furthermore, we delve into resource-constrained Neural Architecture Search (NAS), an emerging technique in recommender systems, to optimize models in terms of FLOPs, latency, and energy consumption while maintaining or enhancing accuracy. Our principal contribution is the development of a Data-aware Neural Architecture Search for Recommender System (DNS-Rec). DNS-Rec is specifically designed to tailor compact network architectures for attention-based SRS models, thereby ensuring accuracy retention. It incorporates data-aware gates to enhance the performance of the recommendation network by learning information from historical user-item interactions. Moreover, DNS-Rec employs a dynamic resource constraint strategy, stabilizing the search process and yielding more suitable architectural solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through rigorous experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets, which highlight the superiority of DNS-Rec in SRSs. Our findings set a new standard for future research in efficient and accurate recommendation systems, marking a significant step forward in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

    <h3>STRec: Sparse Transformer for Sequential Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lixin Zou, Yiqi Wang, Qidong Liu, Wanyu Wang, Wenqi Fan, Yejing Wang, Chengxi Li, Qing Li, Xiangyu Zhao</p>
    <p>With the rapid evolution of transformer architectures, an increasing number of researchers are exploring their application in sequential recommender systems (SRSs). Compared with the former SRS models, the transformer-based models get promising performance on SRS tasks. Existing transformer-based SRS frameworks, however, retain the vanilla attention mechanism, which calculates the attention scores between all item-item pairs in each layer, i.e., item interactions. Consequently, redundant item interactions may downgrade the inference speed and cause high memory costs for the model. In this paper, we first identify the sparse information phenomenon in transformer-based SRS scenarios and propose an efficient model, i.e., Sparse Transformer sequential Recommendation model (STRec). First, we devise a cross-attention-based sparse transformer for efficient sequential recommendation. Then, a novel sampling strategy is derived to  preserve the necessary interactions. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our framework, which could outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing 54% inference time and 70% memory cost. Besides, we provide massive extended experiments to further investigate the property of our framework. Our code is available to ease reproducibility.</p>

    <h3>Mood-Sensitive Truth Discovery For Reliable Recommendation Systems in Social Sensing (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jermaine Marshall, Dong Wang</p>
    <p>This work is motivated by the need to provide reliable information recommendation to users in social sensing. Social sensing has become an emerging application paradigm that uses humans as sensors to observe and report events in the physical world. These human sensed observations are often viewed as binary claims (either true or false). A fundamental challenge in social sensing is how to ascertain the credibility of claims and the reliability of sources without knowing either of them a priori. We refer to this challenge as truth discovery. While prior works have made progress on addressing this challenge, an important limitation exists: they did not explore the mood sensitivity aspect of the problem. Therefore, the claims identified as correct by current solutions can be completely biased in regards to the mood of human sources and lead to useless or even misleading recommendations. In this paper, we present a new analytical model that explicitly considers the mood sensitivity feature in the solution of truth discovery problem. The new model solves a multi-dimensional estimation problem to jointly estimate the correctness and mood neutrality of claims as well as the reliability and mood sensitivity of sources. We compare our model with state-of-the-art truth discovery solutions using four real world datasets collected from Twitter during recent disastrous and emergent events: Brussels Bombing, Paris Attack, Oregon Shooting, Baltimore Riots, which occurred in 2015 and 2016. The results show that our model has significant improvements over the compared baselines by finding more correct and mood neutral claims.</p>
