    <h3>RecExp: A Semantic Recommender System with Explanation Based on Heterogeneous Information Network (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip Yu, Jiawei Hu, Jian Liu, Chuan Shi, Zhiqiang Zhang, Bai Wang</p>
    <p>In recent years, there is a surge of research on recommender system to alleviate the information overload. Many recommendation techniques have been proposed and they have achieved great successes in many applications. However, the explanation of recommendation results is an important but seldom addressed problem. In this paper, we organize the objects and relations in a recommender system with a heterogeneous information network, which integrates more informations and contains rich semantics. Then we employ a semantic meta path based personalized recommendation model and design a recommender system with explanation, called RecExp. The RecExp system has two unique features. (1) Semantic recommendation. RecExp provides different recommendation models to comply with usersâ€™ requirements through setting of meta paths. (2) Interpretive recommendation. Under a hybrid recommendation model, RecExp provides the explanations for the recommendation results.</p>

    <h3>HyPER: A Flexible and Extensible Probabilistic Framework for Hybrid Recommender Systems (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lise Getoor, Magdalini Eirinaki, James Foulds, Pigi Kouki, Shobeir Fakhraei</p>
    <p>As the amount of recorded digital information increases, there is a growing need for flexible recommender systems which can incorporate richly structured data sources to improve recommendations. In this paper, we show how a recently introduced statistical relational learning framework can be used to develop a generic and extensible hybrid recommender system. Our hybrid approach, HyPER (HYbrid Probabilistic Extensible Recommender), incorporates and reasons over a wide range of information sources. Such sources include multiple user-user and item-item similarity measures, content, and social information. HyPER automatically learns to balance these different information signals when making predictions. We build our system using a powerful and intuitive probabilistic programming language called probabilistic soft logic, which enables efficient and accurate prediction by formulating our custom recommender systems with a scalable class of graphical models known as hinge-loss Markov random fields. We experimentally evaluate our approach on two popular recommendation datasets, showing that HyPER can effectively combine multiple information types for improved performance, and can outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p>
