    <h3>Recommendation Systems for Ad Creation: A View from the Trenches (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manisha Verma, Shaunak Mishra</p>
    <p>Creative design is one of the key components of generating engaging content on the web. E-commerce websites need engaging product descriptions, social networks require user posts to have different types of content such as videos, images and hashtags, and traditional media formats such as blogs require content creators to constantly innovate their writing style, and choice of content they publish to engage with their intended audience. Designing the right content, irrespective of the industry, is a time consuming task, often requires several iterations of content selection and modification. Advertising is one such industry where content is the key to capture user interest and generate revenue. Designing engaging and attention grabbing advertisements requires extensive domain knowledge and market trend awareness. This motivates companies to hire marketing specialists to design specific advertising content, most often tasked to create text, image or video advertisements. This process is tedious and iterative which limits the amount of content that can be produced manually. In this talk, we summarize our work focused on automating ad creative design by leveraging state of the art approaches in text mining, ranking, generation, multimodal (visual-linguistic) representations, multilingual text understanding, and recommendation. We discuss how such approaches can help to reduce the time spent on designing ads, and showcase their impact on real world advertising systems and metrics.</p>

    <h3>Designing Online Advertisements via Bandit and Reinforcement Learning (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yusuke Narita, Shota Yasui, Kohei Yata</p>
    <p>Efficient methods to evaluate new algorithms are critical for improving reinforcement learning systems such as ad recommendation systems. A/B tests are reliable, but are time- and money-consuming, and entail a risk of failure. In this paper, we develop a new method of 	extit{off-policy evaluation}, predicting the performance of an algorithm given historical data generated by a different algorithm. Our estimator converges in probability to the true value of a counterfactual algorithm at a rate of √N. We also show how to correctly estimate the variance of our estimator. In a special-case setting which covers contextual bandits, we show that our estimator achieves the lowest variance among a wide class of estimators. These properties hold even when the analyst does not know which among a large number of state variables are actually important, or when the baseline policy is unknown. We validate our method with a simulation experiment and on real-world data from a major advertisement company. We apply our method to improve an ad policy for the aforementioned company. We find that our method produces smaller mean squared errors than state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>A Joint Dynamic Ranking System with DNN and Vector-based Clustering Bandit (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changping Peng, Jincheng Wang, Xiaoxiao Xu, Weipeng Yan, Yong Li, Yongjun Bao, Yu Liu</p>
    <p>The ad-ranking module is the core of the advertising recommender system. Existing ad-ranking modules are mainly based on the deep neural network click-through rate prediction model. Recently an innovative ad-ranking paradigm called DNN-MAB has been introduced to address DNN-only paradigms’ weakness in perceiving highly dynamic user intent over time. We introduce the DNN-MAB paradigm into our ad-ranking system to alleviate the Matthew effect that harms the user experience. Due to data sparsity, however, the actual performance of DNN-MAB is lower than expected. In this paper, we propose an innovative ad-ranking paradigm called DNN-VMAB to solve these problems. Based on vectorization and clustering, it utilizes latent collaborative information in user behavior data to find a set of ads with higher relativity and diversity. As an integration of the essences of classical collaborative filtering, deep click-through rate prediction model, and contextual multi-armed bandit, it can improve platform revenue and user experience. Both offline and online experiments show the advantage of our new algorithm over DNN-MAB and some other existing algorithms.</p>

    <h3>Guiding Creative Design in Online Advertising (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaunak Mishra, Manisha Verma, Jelena Gligorijevic</p>
    <p>Ad creatives (text and images) for a brand play an influential role in online advertising. To design impactful ads, creative strategists employed by the brands (advertisers)typically go through a time consuming process of market research and ideation. Such a process may involve knowing more about the brand, and drawing inspirationfrom prior successful creatives for the brand, and its competitors in the same product category. To assist strategists towards faster creative development, we introduce a recommender system which provides a list of desirable keywords for a given brand. Such keywords can serve as underlying themes, and guide the strategist in finalizing the image and text for the brand’s ad creative. We explore the potential of distributed representations of Wikipedia pages along with a labeled dataset of keywords for 900 brands by using deep relevance matching for recommending a list of keywords for a given brand. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed recommender system over several  baselines for relevance matching; although end-to-end automation of ad creative development still remains an open problem in the advertising industry, the proposed recommender system is a stepping stone by providing valuable insights to creative strategists and advertisers. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Selection and Ordering of Linear Online Video Ads (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Viswanathan Swaminathan, Wreetabrata Kar, Paulo Albuquerque</p>
    <p>This paper studies the selection and ordering of in-stream ads in videos shown in online content publishers. We propose an allocation algorithm that uses a collective measure of price and quality for each ad and factors in slot-specific continuation probabilities to maximize publisher revenue. The algorithm is based on cascade models and uses a dynamic programming method to assign linear (video) ads to slots in an online video. The approach accounts for the negative externality created by lower quality ads placed in a video, leading to viewer exit and thereby preventing the publisher from showing the subsequent ads scheduled in that session. Our algorithm is scalable and suited for real-time applications. A large log of viewer activity from a video ad platform is used to empirically test the algorithm. A series of simulations show that our algorithm, when compared to other algorithms currently practiced in industry, generates more revenue for the publisher and increases viewer retention.</p>

    <h3>Scalable Audience Targeted Models for Brand Advertising on Social Networks (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kunpeng Zhang</p>
    <p>People are using social media to generate, share, and communicate information with each other. Finding actionable insights from such big data has attracted a lot of research attentions on, for example, finding targeted user groups based on their historical on-line activities. However, existing machine learning algorithms fail to keep up with the increasing large data volume. In this paper, we develop a scalable regression-based algorithm called distributed iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (DISTA) that can identify potential users. Our experiments conducted on Facebook data containing billions of users and associated activities show that DISTA with feature selection not only enables on-line audience-targeted approach for precise marketing but also performs efficiently on parallel computers.</p>
