    <h3>Learned Ranking Function: From Short-term Behavior Predictions to Long-term User Satisfaction (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Wu, Jennifer She, Daryl Chang, Lukasz Heldt, Zhe Zhao, Li Wei</p>
    <p>We present the Learned Ranking Function (LRF), a system that takes short-term user-item behavior predictions as input and outputs a slate of recommendations directly optimizing for long-term user satisfaction. Most previous work is based on optimizing hyper-parameters of a heuristic function. We propose to model the problem directly as a slate optimization problem with the objective of maximizing long-term user satisfaction. We also develop a new constraint optimization method that is able to improve the stability for multi-objective optimization. We evaluate our approach with live experiments and describe its deployment on YouTube.</p>

    <h3>Multi-Objective Recommendation via Multivariate Policy Learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Potapov, Sourabh Vaid, Wenzhe Shi, Nakul Agarwal, Olivier Jeunen, Jatin Mandav, Aleksei Ustimenko</p>
    <p>Real-world recommender systems often need to balance multiple objectives when deciding which recommendations to present to users. These include behavioural signals (e.g. clicks, shares, dwell time), as well as broader objectives (e.g. diversity, fairness). Scalarisation methods are commonly used to handle this balancing task, where a weighted average of per-objective reward signals determines the final score used for ranking. Naturally, <i>how</i> these weights are computed exactly, is key to success for any online platform. We frame this as a decision-making task, where the scalarisation weights are <i>actions</i> taken to maximise an overall North Star reward (e.g. long-term user retention or growth). We extend existing policy learning methods to the continuous multivariate action domain, proposing to maximise a pessimistic lower bound on the North Star reward that the learnt policy will yield. Typical lower bounds based on normal approximations suffer from insufficient coverage, and we propose an efficient and effective policy-dependent correction for this. We provide guidance to design stochastic data collection policies, as well as highly sensitive reward signals. Empirical observations from simulations, offline and online experiments highlight the efficacy of our deployed approach.</p>

    <h3>Pareto Front Approximation for Multi-Objective Session-Based Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timo Wilm, Philipp Normann, Felix Stepprath</p>
    <p>This work introduces MultiTRON, an approach that adapts Pareto front approximation techniques to multi-objective session-based recommender systems using a transformer neural network. Our approach optimizes trade-offs between key metrics such as click-through and conversion rates by training on sampled preference vectors. A significant advantage is that after training, a single model can access the entire Pareto front, allowing it to be tailored to meet the specific requirements of different stakeholders by adjusting an additional input vector that weights the objectives. We validate the model’s performance through extensive offline and online evaluation. For broader application and research, the source code is made available. The results confirm the model’s ability to manage multiple recommendation objectives effectively, offering a flexible tool for diverse business needs.</p>

    <h3>Promoting Two-sided Fairness with Adaptive Weights for Providers and Customers in Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen, Lanling Xu, Sheng Chen, Zihan Lin, Jinpeng Wang</p>
    <p>At present, most recommender systems involve two stakeholders, providers and customers. Apart from maximizing the recommendation accuracy, the fairness issue for both sides should also be considered. However, there is a trade-off for multi-objective optimization problems, where optimizing one objective (e.g. provider-side fairness) may degrade the performance of others (e.g. accuracy). Most of previous studies try to improve two-sided fairness with post-processing algorithms or fairness-aware loss constraints, which are highly dependent on the heuristic adjustments without respect to the optimization goal of accuracy. In contrast, we propose a novel training framework, adaptive weighting  towards two-sided fairness-aware recommendation (named Ada2Fair), which lies in the extension of the accuracy-focused objective to a controllable preference learning loss over the interaction data. Specifically, we adjust the optimization scale of an interaction sample with an adaptive weight generator, and estimate the two-sided fairness-aware weights within model training. During the training process, the recommender is trained with two-sided fairness-aware weights to boost the utility of niche providers and inactive customers in a unified way. Extensive experiments on three public datasets verify the effectiveness of Ada2Fair, which can achieve Pareto improvements in two-sided fairness-aware recommendation. Our code implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Ada2Fair.</p>

    <h3>AMBAR: A dataset for Assessing Multiple Beyond-Accuracy Recommenders (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Contreras, Ludovico Boratto, Elizabeth Gómez, Maria Salamo</p>
    <p>Nowadays a recommendation model should exploit additional information from both the user and item perspectives, in addition to utilizing user-item interaction data. Datasets are central in offering the required information for evaluating new models or algorithms. Although there are many datasets in the literature with user and item properties, there are several issues not covered yet: (i) it is difficult to perform cross-analysis of properties at user and item level as they are not related in most cases; and (ii) on top of that, in many occasions datasets do not allow analysis at different granularity levels. In this paper, we propose a new dataset in the music domain, named AMBAR, that includes the above-mentioned issues. Besides detailing in depth the structure of the new dataset, we also show its application in contexts (i.e., multi-objective, fair, and calibrated recommendations) where both the effectiveness and the beyond-accuracy perspectives of recommendation are assessed.</p>

    <h3>Looks Can Be Deceiving: Linking User-Item Interactions and User’s Propensity Towards Multi-Objective Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Boratto, Patrik Dokoupil, Ladislav Peska</p>
    <p>Multi-objective recommender systems (MORS) provide suggestions to users according to multiple (and possibly conflicting) goals. When a system optimizes its results at the individual-user level, it tailors them on a user’s propensity towards the different objectives. Hence, the capability to understand users’ fine-grained needs towards each goal is crucial. In this paper, we present the results of a user study in which we monitored the way users interacted with recommended items, as well as their self-proclaimed propensities towards relevance, novelty and diversity objectives. The study was divided into several sessions, where users evaluated recommendation lists originating from a relevance-only single-objective baseline as well as MORS. We show that despite MORS-based recommendations attracted less selections, its presence in the early sessions is crucial for users’ satisfaction in the later stages. Surprisingly, the self-proclaimed willingness of users to interact with novel and diverse items is not always reflected in the recommendations they accept. Post-study questionnaires provide insights on how to deal with this matter, suggesting that MORS-based results should be accompanied by elements that allow users to understand the recommendations, so as to facilitate their acceptance.</p>

    <h3>Learning the True Objectives of Multiple Tasks in Sequential Behavior Modeling (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiawei Zhang</p>
    <p>Multi-task optimization is an emerging research field in recommender systems that focuses on improving the recommendation performance of multiple tasks. Various methods have been proposed in the past to address task weight balancing, gradient conflict resolution, Pareto optimality, etc, yielding promising results in specific contexts. However, when it comes to real-world scenarios involving user sequential behaviors, these methods are not well suited. To address this gap, we propose AcouRec, a novel and effective approach for sequential behavior modeling in multi-task recommender systems inspired by acoustic attenuation. Specifically, AcouRec introduces an impact attenuation mechanism to mitigate the uncertain task interference in multi-task optimization. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AcouRec.</p>

    <h3>Reproducibility of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning Recommendation: Interplay between Effectiveness and Beyond-Accuracy Perspectives (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Paparella, Ludovico Boratto, Vito Walter Anelli, Tommaso Di Noia</p>
    <p>Providing effective suggestions is of predominant importance for successful Recommender Systems (RSs). Nonetheless, the need of accounting for additional multiple objectives has become prominent, from both the final users’ and the item providers’ points of view. This need has led to a new class of RSs, called Multi-Objective Recommender Systems (MORSs). These systems are designed to provide suggestions by considering multiple (conflicting) objectives simultaneously, such as diverse, novel, and fairness-aware recommendations. In this work, we reproduce a state-of-the-art study on MORSs that exploits a reinforcement learning agent to satisfy three objectives, i.e., accuracy, diversity, and novelty of recommendations. The selected study is one of the few MORSs where the source code and datasets are released to ensure the reproducibility of the proposed approach. Interestingly, we find that some challenges arise when replicating the results of the original work, due to the nature of multiple-objective problems. We also extend the evaluation of the approach to analyze the impact of improving user-centred objectives of recommendations (i.e., diversity and novelty) in terms of algorithmic bias. To this end, we take into consideration both popularity and category of the items. We discover some interesting trends in the recommendation performance according to different evaluation metrics. In addition, we see that the multi-objective reinforcement learning approach is responsible for increasing the bias disparity in the output of the recommendation algorithm for those items belonging to positively/negatively biased categories. We publicly release datasets and codes in the following GitHub repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MORS_reproducibility-BD60</p>

    <h3>ReCon: Reducing Congestion in Job Recommendation using Optimal Transport (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jefrey Lijffijt, Tijl de Bie, Yoosof Mashayekhi, Bo Kang</p>
    <p>Recommender systems may suffer from congestion, meaning that there is an unequal distribution of the items in how often they are recommended. Some items may be recommended much more than others. Recommenders are increasingly used in domains where items have limited availability, such as the job market, where congestion is especially problematic: Recommending a vacancy—for which typically only one person will be hired—to a large number of job seekers may lead to frustration for job seekers, as they may be applying for jobs where they are not hired. This may also leave vacancies unfilled and result in job market inefficiency. We propose a novel approach to job recommendation called ReCon, accounting for the congestion problem. Our approach is to use an optimal transport component to ensure a more equal spread of vacancies over job seekers, combined with a job recommendation model in a multi-objective optimization problem. We evaluated our approach on two real-world job market datasets. The evaluation results show that ReCon has good performance on both congestion-related (e.g., Congestion) and desirability (e.g., NDCG) measures.</p>

    <h3>Broadening the Scope: Evaluating the Potential of Recommender Systems beyond prioritizing Accuracy (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vito Walter Anelli, Dario Di Palma, Vincenzo Paparella, Tommaso Di Noia</p>
    <p>Although beyond-accuracy metrics have gained attention in the last decade, the accuracy of recommendations is still considered the gold standard to evaluate Recommender Systems (RSs). This approach prioritizes the accuracy of recommendations, neglecting the quality of suggestions to enhance user needs, such as diversity and novelty, as well as trustworthiness regulations in RSs for user and provider fairness. As a result, single metrics determine the success of RSs, but this approach fails to consider other criteria simultaneously. A downside of this method is that the most accurate model configuration may not excel in addressing the remaining criteria. This study seeks to broaden RS evaluation by introducing a multi-objective evaluation that considers all model configurations simultaneously under several perspectives. To achieve this, several hyper-parameter configurations of an RS model are trained, and the Pareto-optimal ones are retrieved. The Quality Indicators (QI) of Pareto frontiers, which are gaining interest in Multi-Objective Optimization research, are adapted to RSs. QI enables evaluating the model’s performance by considering various configurations and giving the same importance to each metric. The experiments show that this multi-objective evaluation overturns the ranking of performance among RSs, paving the way to revisit the evaluation approaches of the RecSys research community.

    <h3>Multiobjective Evaluation of Reinforcement Learning Based Recommender Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantin Vorontsov, Anastasia Ianina, Alexey Grishanov</p>
    <p>Movielens dataset has become a default choice for recommender systems evaluation. In this paper we analyze the best strategies of a Reinforcement Learning agent on Movielens (1M) dataset studying the balance between precision and diversity of recommendations. We found that trivial strategies are able to maximize ranking quality criteria, but useless for users of the recommendation system due to the lack of diversity in final predictions. Our proposed method stimulates the agent to explore the environment using the stochasticity of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Experiments show that optimization of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process drift coefficient improves the diversity of recommendations while maintaining high nDCG and HR criteria. To the best of our knowledge, the analysis of agent strategies in recommendation environments has not been studied excessively in previous works.</p>

    <h3>MARRS: A Framework for multi-objective risk-aware route recommendation using Multitask-Transformer (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bhumika ., Debasis Das</p>
    <p>One of the most significant map services in navigation applications is route recommendation. However, most route recommendation systems only recommend trips based on time and distance, impacting quality-of-experience and route selection. This paper introduces a novel framework, namely MARRS, a multi-objective route recommendation system based on heterogeneous urban sensing open data (i.e., crime, accident, traffic flow, road network, meteorological, calendar event, and point of interest distributions). We introduce a wide, deep, and multitask-learning (WD-MTL) framework that uses a transformer to extract spatial, temporal, and semantic correlation for predicting crime, accident, and traffic flow of particular road segment. Later, for a particular source and destination, the adaptive epsilon constraint technique is used to optimize route satisfying multiple objective functions. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of figuring out the safest and efficient route selection.</p>

    <h3>Recommending for a Multi-Sided Marketplace with Heterogeneous Contents (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian Xing Zhang, Yuyan Wang, Long Tao</p>
    <p>Many online personalization platforms today are recommending heterogeneous contents in a multi-sided marketplace consisting of consumers, merchants and other partners. For a recommender system to be successful in these contexts, it faces two main challenges. First, each side in the marketplace has different and potentially conflicting utilities. Recommending for a multi-sided marketplace therefore entails jointly optimizing multiple objectives with trade-offs. Second, the off-the-shelf recommendation algorithms are not applicable to the heterogeneous content space, where a recommendation item could be an aggregation of other recommendation items. In this work, we develop a general framework for recommender systems in a multi-sided marketplace with heterogeneous and hierarchical contents. We propose a constrained optimization framework with machine learning models for each objective as inputs, and a probabilistic structural model for users’ engagement patterns on heterogeneous contents. Our proposed structural modeling approach ensures consistent user experience across different levels of aggregation of the contents, and provides levels of transparency to the merchants and content providers. We further develop an efficient optimization solution for ranking and recommendation in large-scale online systems in real time. We implement the framework at Uber Eats, one of the largest online food delivery platforms in the world and a three-sided marketplace consisting of eaters, restaurant partners and delivery partners. Online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in ranking heterogeneous contents and optimizing for the three sides in the marketplace. Our framework has been deployed globally as the recommendation algorithm for Uber Eats’ homepage.</p>

    <h3>Pursuing Optimal Trade-Off Solutions in Multi-Objective Recommender Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Paparella</p>
    <p>Traditional research in Recommender Systems (RSs) often solely focuses on accuracy and a limited number of beyond-accuracy dimensions. Nonetheless, real-world RSs need to consider several other aspects, such as customer satisfaction or stakeholders’ interests. Consequently, the evaluation criteria must comprehend other dimensions, like click rate, or revenue, to cite a few of them. However, what objective should the system optimize, and what objective should it sacrifice? An emerging approach to tackle the problem and aim to blend different (sometimes conflicting) objectives is Multi-Objective Recommender Systems (MORSs). This proposal sketches a strategy to exploit the Pareto optimality to introduce a new optimal solution selection approach and investigate how existing RSs perform with multi-objective tasks. The goals are twofold: (i) discovering how to rank the solutions lying on the Pareto frontier to find the best trade-off solution and (ii) comparing the Pareto frontiers of different recommendation approaches to assess whether one performs better for the considered objectives. These measures could lead to a new class of MORSs that train an RS on multiple objectives to reach the best trade-off solution directly.</p>

The design and the optimization of our systems are guided by various, partially competing objectives and are, therefore, influenced by various factors. Similarly to commercial video on demand services, ZDF is interested in binding its audience by providing personalized recommendations in its streaming media service. However, more importantly, as a Public Service Media provider, we are committed to offer diverse, universal, unbiased, and transparent recommendations while following established editorial guidelines and strict privacy regulations. Additionally, we are committed to provide environmentally-friendly or green recommendations optimizing our systems for run time and power consumption.
