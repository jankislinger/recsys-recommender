    <h3>Supporting Knowledge Workers through Personal Information Assistance with Context-aware Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahta Bakhshizadeh</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are extensively employed across various domains to mitigate information overload by providing personalized content. Despite their widespread use in sectors such as streaming, social networks, and e-commerce, utilizing them for personal information assistance is a comparatively novel application. This emerging application aims to develop intelligent systems capable of proactively providing knowledge workers with the most relevant information based on their context to enhance productivity. In this paper, we explore this innovative application by first defining the scope of our study, outlining the key objectives, and introducing main challenges. We then present our current results and progress, including a comprehensive literature review, the proposal of a framework, the collection of a pioneering dataset, and the establishment of a benchmark for evaluating a recommendation scenario on our published dataset. We also discuss our ongoing efforts and future research directions.</p>

    <h3>Demystifying Recommender Systems: A Multi-faceted Examination of Explanation Generation, Impact, and Perception (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Balloccu</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have become an integral component of the digital landscape, impacting a multitude of services and industries ranging from e-commerce to entertainment and beyond. By offering personalised suggestions, these systems challenge a fundamental problem in our modern information society named information overload. As users face a deluge of choices, recommender systems help sift through this immense sea of possibilities, delivering a personalised subset of options that align with user preferences and historical behaviour. However, despite their considerable utility, recommender systems often operate as “black boxes,” obscuring the rationale behind recommendations. This opacity can engender mistrust and undermine user engagement, thus attenuating the overall effectiveness of the system. Researchers have emphasized the importance of explanations in recommender systems, highlighting how explanations can enhance system transparency, foster user trust, and improve decision-making processes, thereby enriching user experiences and yielding potential business benefits. Yet, a significant gap persists in the current state of human-understandable explanations research. While recommender systems have grown increasingly complex, our capacity to generate clear, concise, and relevant explanations that reflect this complexity remains limited. Crafting explanations that are both understandable and reflective of sophisticated algorithmic decision-making processes poses a significant challenge, especially in a manner that meets the user’s cognitive and contextual needs.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation of High Quality Representative Reviews in e-commerce (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chetan Kalyan, Sudeshna Sarkar, Muthusamy Chelliah, Debanjan Paul, Prajit Prashant Sinai Nadkarni</p>
    <p>Users of ecommerce portals commonly use customer reviews for making purchase decisions. Many products contain tens or hundreds of reviews which makes it impossible for the customer to read all of them in order to get a good idea about the product. A review recommendation system that can recommend a subset of the reviews is thus useful for e-commerce websites. However customer reviews are of varied quality and different reviews cover different aspects or issues about the product. We follow previous work that maintain the statistical distribution of product aspects along with their associated sentiments of the entire review set for that particular product. However we address the challenge which arises due to the fact that similar aspects are mentioned in different reviews using different natural language expressions (e.g. camera, photo and picture refers to the same product aspect of camera). We use vector representations to identify mentions of similar aspects and group them together under single product aspect. Review helpfulness score may act as a proxy for quality of reviews, but this approach suffers from cold start problem as new reviews do not have any helpfulness score. We measure the quality of the review based on its content by doing supervised training using a convolutional neural network. Though  our neural network model is trained with reviews from Amazon dataset which have helpfulness score, our model can be used to predict the quality score of new reviews which do not have any helpfulness score. The recommended subset of reviews have high content score and the coverage of the product aspects, issues and sentiments are representative of the entire review set. The system is evaluated on datasets from Amazon and is found to be more useful than the competing methods.</p>
