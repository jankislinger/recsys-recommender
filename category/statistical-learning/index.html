    <h3>Using Learnable Physics for Real-Time Exercise Form Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gautam Chauhan, Abhishek Jaiswal, Nisheeth Srivastava</p>
    <p>Good posture and form are essential for safe and productive exercising. Even in gym settings, trainers may not be readily available for feedback. Rehabilitation therapies and fitness workouts can thus benefit from recommender systems that provide real-time evaluation. In this paper, we present an algorithmic pipeline that can diagnose problems in exercises technique and offer corrective recommendations, with high sensitivity and specificity, in real-time. We use MediaPipe for pose recognition, count repetitions using peak-prominence detection, and use a learnable physics simulator to track motion evolution for each exercise. A test video is diagnosed based on deviations from the prototypical learned motion using statistical learning. The system is evaluated on six full and upper body exercises. These real-time interactive suggestions counseled via low-cost equipment like smartphones will allow exercisers to rectify potential mistakes making self-practice feasible while reducing the risk of workout injuries.</p>

    <h3>Modeling Users and Items for Recommenders: There Is More than Semantics (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mete Sertkan</p>
    <p>Recommender systems aim to help us to take better decisions and thus to save resources and increase satisfaction. Personalized recommendations are their main asset. In some domains, such as tourism or news, recommender systems rely more on content-based approaches to give personalized recommendations, due to domain-specific challenges. Content-based methods tend to recommend items semantically similar to the usersâ€™ previous consumptions. However, the content of items (e.g., text, visuals, categories, etc.) usually contains more than semantic properties.<br>In this PhD work we focus on the multifaceted nature of the recommendation items. Besides the mentioned semantic properties, we also take into account visual and textual style elements and more complex concepts such as emotions and personality. Our aim is to address people also on a non-rational, non-verbal, and rather emotional level; and thus, to improve recommendations. We propose a statistical-learning-based characterization of items, a picture-based approach to profile users and items, and a neural end-to-end approach, where we learn to represent users and items, and simultaneously to recommend. In all of the proposed methods we consider in addition to the semantic content either stylistic elements and/or more complex concepts like personality, and observe their impact. To contribute the community, we plan to open source our code and the datasets (to the extent our collaborators agree).</p>
