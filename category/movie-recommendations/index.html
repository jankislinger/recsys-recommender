    <h3>Towards Understanding The Gaps of Offline And Online Evaluation Metrics: Impact of Series vs. Movie Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashok Chandrashekar, Puja Das, Bora Edizel, Tim Sweetser, Kamilia Ahmadi</p>
    <p>In the realm of recommender systems research, offline evaluation metrics like NDCG, Recall, or Precision are often used to measure the impact. On the other hand, common industry practices suggest evaluating new ideas/models through A/B tests where decisions are made based on business metrics like the overall engagement of users. A new model may show improvement in offline metrics but performance loss in online metrics. One reason that leads to this phenomenon is the counterfactual nature of the recommendation problem which can be addressed by off-policy evaluation methods. Another reason is the degree of causal connection between offline evaluation metrics and observed online metrics. In this work, we will share our learnings from two sets of A/B tests that we conducted at Max1 where we observed a mismatch between online and offline metrics due to a weak causal connection between online and offline metrics. Thanks to learnings from A/B tests, we discovered and quantified the impact of series to movie ratio at recommendations. Our experiments show that there is an optimal amount of series to movies ratio that provides the best possible results for user engagement</p>

    <h3>Towards a Taxonomy of User Feedback Intents for Conversational Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Chen, Wanling Cai</p>
    <p>Understanding users’ feedback on recommendation in natural language is crucially important for assisting the system to refine its understanding of the user’s preferences and provide more accurate recommendations in the subsequent interactions. In this paper, we report the results of an exploratory study on a human-human dialogue dataset centered around movie recommendations. In particular, we manually labeled a set of over 200 dialogues at the utterance level, and then conducted descriptive analysis on them from both seekers’ and recommenders’ perspectives. The results reveal not only seekers’ feedback intents as well as the types of preferences they have expressed, but also the reactions of human recommenders that have finally led to successful recommendation. A taxonomy for feedback intents is established along with the results, which could be constructive for improving conversational recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Audio-Visual Encoding of Multimedia Content to Enhance Movie Recommendations (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Schedl, Bogdan Ionescu, Paolo Cremonesi, Yashar Deldjoo, Mihai Gabriel Constantin, Hamid Eghbal-zadeh</p>
    <p>We propose a multi-modal content-based movie recommender system that replaces human-generated metadata by content descriptions automatically extracted from the visual and audio channels of a video. Content descriptors improve over traditional metadata in terms of both richness (it is possible to extract hundreds of meaningful features covering various modalities) and quality (content features are consistent across different systems and immune to human errors). Our recommender system integrates state-of-the-art aesthetic and deep visual features as well as block-level and i-vector audio features. For fusing the different modalities, we propose a rank aggregation strategy extending the Borda count approach. We evaluate the proposed multi-modal recommender system comprehensively against metadata-based baselines. To this end, we conduct two empirical studies: (i) a system-centric study to measure the offline quality of recommendations in terms of accuracy-related and beyond-accuracy performance measures (novelty, diversity, and coverage), and (ii) a user-centric online experiment, measuring different subjective metrics, including relevance, satisfaction, and diversity. In both studies, we use a dataset of more than 4,000 movie trailers, which makes our approach versatile. Our results shed light on the accuracy and beyond-accuracy performance of audio, visual, and textual features in content-based movie recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Recommender Systems in the Internet of Talking Things (IoTT) (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco De Gemmis, Fedelucio Narducci, Pasquale Lops, Giovanni Semeraro</p>
    <p>In the Internet of Things, smart devices are connected to collect and to exchange data. In our vision, in the Internet of Talking Things, objects such as intelligent fridges will be able to communicate with humans to set up preferences and profiling options which allow a personalized usage of the object. In this paper, we present a recommender system implemented as a Telegram Bot, that can fit with the previous scenario. The system is a movie recommender which exploits the information available in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud for generating the recommendations and leading the conversation with the user. It can be easily seen as an intelligent component of a connected TV.</p>

    <h3>Topical Semantic Recommendations for Auteur Films (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Till Plumbaum, Andreas Lommatzsch, Christian Rakow</p>
    <p>With the ubiquity of fast internet connections and the growing availability of Video-On-Demand (VOD) services powerful recommender systems are needed. Traditionally, movie recommender systems apply user-based collaborative filtering providing high quality recommendations if users maintain user profiles describing preferences and movie ratings. The shortcomings of Collaborative Filtering are that comprehensive user profiles are required and users tend to get recommendations very similar to the user profile (filter bubble). In addition, CF-based recommenders neither consider current trends nor the context. In order to overcome these weaknesses, we develop a system identifying interesting events in the stream of current news and deploying this information for computing recommendations. Our system gathers topics of interest from Twitter and RSS-Feeds, extracts relevant Named Entities, and uses semantic relations for recommending movies closely related to these topics. We explain the used algorithms and show that our system provides highly relevant recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Crowd-Based Personalized Natural Language Explanations for Recommendations (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Maxwell Harper, Shuo Chang, Loren Gilbert Terveen</p>
    <p>Explanations are important for users to make decisions on whether to take recommendations. However, algorithm generated explanations can be overly simplistic and unconvincing. We believe that humans can overcome these limitations. Inspired by how people explain word-of-mouth recommendations, we designed a process, combining crowdsourcing and computation, that generates personalized natural language explanations. We modeled key topical aspects of movies, asked crowdworkers to write explanations based on quotes from online movie reviews, and personalized the explanations presented to users based on their rating history. We evaluated the explanations by surveying 220 MovieLens users, finding that compared to personalized tag-based explanations, natural language explanations: 1) contain a more appropriate amount of information, 2) earn more trust from users, and 3) make users more satisfied. This paper contributes to the research literature by describing a scalable process for generating high quality and personalized natural language explanations, improving on state-of-the-art content-based explanations, and showing the feasibility and advantages of approaches that combine human wisdom with algorithmic processes.</p>

    <h3>Letting Users Choose Recommender Algorithms: An Experimental Study (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Maxwell Harper, Daniel Kluver, Joseph A. Konstan, Michael D. Ekstrand</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are not one-size-fits-all; different algorithms and data sources have different strengths, making them a better or worse fit for different users and use cases. As one way of taking advantage of the relative merits of different algorithms, we gave users the ability to change the algorithm providing their movie recommendations and studied how they make use of this power. We conducted our study with the launch of a new version of the MovieLens movie recommender that supports multiple recommender algorithms and allows users to choose the algorithm they want to provide their recommendations. We examine log data from user interactions with this new feature to understand whether and how users switch among recommender algorithms, and select a final algorithm to use. We also look at the properties of the algorithms as they were experienced by users and examine their relationships to user behavior. We found that a substantial portion of our user base (25%) used the recommender-switching feature. The majority of users who used the control only switched algorithms a few times, trying a few out and settling down on an algorithm that they would leave alone. The largest number of users prefer a matrix factorization algorithm, followed closely by item-item collaborative filtering; users selected both of these algorithms much more often than they chose a non-personalized mean recommender. The algorithms did produce measurably different recommender lists for the users in the study, but these differences were not directly predictive of user choice.</p>

    <h3>Improving IMDb Movie Recommendations with Interactive Settings and Filters (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Dooms, Luc Martens, Toon De Pessemier</p>
    <p>IMDb is a widely known online movie platform that offers movie information, allows to rate movies and recommends interesting movies to users. The IMDb movie recommendations do not however offer any means for interactivity or user control, which inherently limits their contextual adaptability. In this work we describe our Google Chrome extension – called MovieBrain – which offers interactive movie recommendations and integrates the IMDb website for user rating data. Dynamic settings and genre filters are available, allowing users to manually fine-tune the recommendation process and its results.</p>
