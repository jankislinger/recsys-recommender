    <h3>Putting Popularity Bias Mitigation to the Test: A User-Centric Evaluation in Music Recommenders (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Ungruh, Karlijn Dinnissen, Maria Soledad Pera, Hanna Hauptmann, Anja Volk</p>
    <p>Popularity bias is a prominent phenomenon in recommender systems (RS), especially in the music domain. Although popularity bias mitigation techniques are known to enhance the fairness of RS while maintaining their high performance, there is a lack of understanding regarding users’ actual perception of the suggested music. To address this gap, we conducted a user study (n=40) exploring user satisfaction and perception of personalized music recommendations generated by algorithms that explicitly mitigate popularity bias. Specifically, we investigate item-centered and user-centered bias mitigation techniques, aiming to ensure fairness for artists or users, respectively. Results show that neither mitigation technique harms the users’ satisfaction with the recommendation lists despite promoting underrepresented items. However, the item-centered mitigation technique impacts user perception; by promoting less popular items, it reduces users’ familiarity with the items. Lower familiarity evokes discovery—the feeling that the recommendations enrich the user’s taste. We demonstrate that this  can ultimately lead to higher satisfaction, highlighting the potential of less-popular recommendations to improve the user experience.</p>

    <h3>Scaling Session-Based Transformer Recommendations using Optimized Negative Sampling and Loss Functions (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Normann, Timo Wilm, Paul-Vincent Kobow, Sophie Baumeister</p>
    <p>This work introduces TRON, a scalable session-based Transformer Recommender using Optimized Negative-sampling. Motivated by the scalability and performance limitations of prevailing models such as SASRec and GRU4Rec+, TRON integrates top-k negative sampling and listwise loss functions to enhance its recommendation accuracy. Evaluations on relevant large-scale e-commerce datasets show that TRON improves upon the recommendation quality of current methods while maintaining training speeds similar to SASRec. A live A/B test yielded an 18.14% increase in click-through rate over SASRec, highlighting the potential of TRON in practical settings. For further research, we provide access to our source code and an anonymized dataset.</p>

    <h3>RADio – Rank-Aware Divergence Metrics to Measure Normative Diversity in News Recommendations (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mateo Gutierrez Granada, Sanne Vrijenhoek, Maarten de Rijke, Gabriel Bénédict, Daan Odijk</p>
    <p>In traditional recommender system literature, diversity is often seen as the opposite of similarity, and typically defined as the distance between identified topics, categories or word models. However, this is not expressive of the social science’s interpretation of diversity, which accounts for a news organization’s norms and values and which we here refer to as normative diversity. We introduce RADio, a versatile metrics framework to evaluate recommendations according to these normative goals. RADio introduces a rank-aware Jensen Shannon (JS) divergence. This combination accounts for (i) a user’s decreasing propensity to observe items further down a list and (ii) full distributional shifts as opposed to point estimates. We evaluate RADio’s ability to reflect five normative concepts in news recommendations on the Microsoft News Dataset and six (neural) recommendation algorithms, with the help of our metadata enrichment pipeline. We find that RADio provides insightful estimates that can potentially be used to inform news recommender system design.</p>

    <h3>Multiobjective Evaluation of Reinforcement Learning Based Recommender Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantin Vorontsov, Anastasia Ianina, Alexey Grishanov</p>
    <p>Movielens dataset has become a default choice for recommender systems evaluation. In this paper we analyze the best strategies of a Reinforcement Learning agent on Movielens (1M) dataset studying the balance between precision and diversity of recommendations. We found that trivial strategies are able to maximize ranking quality criteria, but useless for users of the recommendation system due to the lack of diversity in final predictions. Our proposed method stimulates the agent to explore the environment using the stochasticity of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Experiments show that optimization of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process drift coefficient improves the diversity of recommendations while maintaining high nDCG and HR criteria. To the best of our knowledge, the analysis of agent strategies in recommendation environments has not been studied excessively in previous works.</p>

    <h3>FISSA: Fusing Item Similarity Models with Self-Attention Networks for Sequential Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing Lin, Zhong Ming, Weike Pan</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation has been a hot research topic because of its practicability and high accuracy by capturing the sequential information. As deep learning (DL) based methods being widely adopted to model the local and dynamic preferences beneath users’ behavior sequences, the modeling of users’ global and static preferences tends to be underestimated that usually, only some simple and crude users’ latent representations are introduced. Moreover, most existing methods hold an assumption that users’ intention can be fully captured by considering the historical behaviors, while neglect the possible uncertainty of users’ intention in reality, which may be influenced by the appearance of the candidate items to be recommended. In this paper, we thus focus on these two issues, i.e., the imperfect modeling of users’ global preferences in most DL-based sequential recommendation methods and the uncertainty of users’ intention brought by the candidate items, and propose a novel solution named fusing item similarity models with self-attention networks (FISSA) for sequential recommendation. Specifically, we treat the state-of-the-art self-attentive sequential recommendation (SASRec) model as the local representation learning module to capture the dynamic preferences beneath users’ behavior sequences in our FISSA, and further propose a global representation learning module to improve the modeling of users’ global preferences and a gating module that balances the local and global representations by taking the information of the candidate items into account. The global representation learning module can be seen as a location-based attention layer, which is effective to fit in well with the parallelization training process of the self-attention framework. The gating module calculates the weight by modeling the relationship among the candidate item, the recently interacted item and the global preference of each user using an MLP layer. Extensive empirical studies on five commonly used datasets show that our FISSA significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines in terms of two commonly used metrics.</p>

    <h3>Human-Recommender Systems: From Benchmark Data to Benchmark Cognitive Models (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Shafto, Olfa Nasraoui</p>
    <p>We bring to the fore of the recommender system research community, an inconvenient truth about the current state of understanding how recommender system algorithms and humans influence one another, both computationally and cognitively. Unlike the great variety of supervised machine learning algorithms which traditionally rely on expert input labels and are typically used for decision making by an expert, recommender systems specifically rely on data input from non-expert or casual users and are meant to be used directly by these same non-expert users on an every day basis. Furthermore, the advances in online machine learning, data generation, and predictive model learning have become increasingly interdependent, such that each one feeds on the other in an iterative cycle. Research in psychology suggests that people’s choices are (1) contextually dependent, and (2) dependent on interaction history. Thus, while standard methods of training and assessing performance of recommender systems rely on benchmark datasets, we suggest that a critical step in the evolution of recommender systems is the development of benchmark of human behavior that capture contextual and dynamic aspects of human behavior. It is important to emphasize that even extensive real life user-tests may not be sufficient to make up for this gap in benchmarking validity because user tests are typically done with either a focus on user satisfaction or engagement (clicks, sales, likes, etc) with whatever the recommender algorithm suggests to the user, and thus ignore the human cognitive aspect. We conclude by highlighting the interdisciplinary implications of this endeavor.</p>
