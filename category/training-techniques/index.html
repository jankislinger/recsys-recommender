    <h3>Sliding Window Training – Utilizing Historical Recommender Systems Data for Foundation Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ko-Jen Hsiao, Yesu Feng, Sudarshan Lamkhede, Swanand Joshi, Zhe Zhang</p>
    <p>Long-lived recommender systems (RecSys) often encounter lengthy user-item interaction histories that span many years. To effectively learn long term user preferences, Large RecSys foundation models (FM) need to encode this information in pretraining. Usually, this is done by either generating a long enough sequence length to take all history sequences as input at the cost of large model input dimension or by dropping some parts of the user history to accommodate model size and latency requirements on the production serving side. In this paper, we introduce a sliding window training technique to incorporate long user history sequences during training time without increasing the model input dimension. We show the quantitative \& qualitative improvements this technique brings to the RecSys FM in learning user long term preferences. We additionally show that the average quality of items in the catalog learnt in pretraining also improves.</p>

    <h3>Effective and Efficient Training for Sequential Recommendation using Recency Sampling (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandr Petrov, Craig Macdonald</p>
    <p>Many modern sequential recommender systems use deep neural networks, which can effectively estimate the relevance of items but require a lot of time to train. Slow training increases expenses, hinders product development timescales and prevents the model from being regularly updated to adapt to changing user preferences. Training such sequential models involves appropriately sampling past user interactions to create a realistic training objective. The existing training objectives have limitations. For instance, next item prediction never uses the beginning of the sequence as a learning target, thereby potentially discarding valuable data. On the other hand, the item masking used by BERT4Rec is only weakly related to the goal of the sequential recommendation; therefore, it requires much more time to obtain an effective model. Hence, we propose a novel Recency-based Sampling of Sequences training objective that addresses both limitations. We apply our method to various recent and state-of-the-art model architectures – such as GRU4Rec, Caser, and SASRec. We show that the models enhanced with our method can achieve performances exceeding or very close to state-of-the-art BERT4Rec, but with much less training time.</p>
