    <h3>One-class recommendation systems  with  the hinge pairwise distance loss and orthogonal representations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramin Raziperchikolaei, Young-joo Chung</p>
    <p>In one-class recommendation systems, the goal is to learn a model from a small set of interacted users and items and then identify the positively-related (i.e., similar) user-item pairs among a large number of pairs with unknown interactions. Most loss functions in the literature rely on dissimilar pairs of users and items, which are selected from the ones with unknown interactions, to obtain better prediction performance. The main issue of this strategy is that it needs a large number of dissimilar pairs, which increases the training time significantly. In this paper, the goal is to only use the similar set to train the models and discard the dissimilar set.  We highlight three trivial solutions that the models converge to when they are trained only on similar pairs: collapsed, dimensional collapsed, and shrinking solutions. We propose a hinge pairwise loss and an orthogonality term that can be added to the objective functions in the literature to avoid these trivial solutions. We conduct experiments on various tasks on public and real-world datasets, which show that our approach using only similar pairs can be trained several times faster than the state-of-the-art methods while achieving competitive results.</p>

    <h3>Neighborhood-Based Collaborative Filtering for Conversational Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Mcauley, Zhouhang Xie, Nathan Kallus, Dawen Liang, Rahul Jha, Hyunsik Jeon, Zhankui He, Harald Steck, Junda Wu</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) should understand users’ expressed interests that are frequently semantically rich and knowledge intensive. Prior works attempt to address this challenge by making use of external knowledge bases or parametric knowledge in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we study a complementary solution, exploiting item knowledge in the training data. We hypothesise that many inference-time user requests can be answered via reusing popular crowd-written answers associated with similar training queries. Following this intuition, we define a class of neighborhood-based CRS that make recommendations by identifying popular items associated with similar training dialogue contexts. Experiments on Inspired, Redial, and Reddit benchmarks show that despite its simplicity, our method achieves comparable to better performance than state-of-the-art LLM-based methods with over 200 times more parameters. We also show neighborhood and model-based predictions can be combined to achieve further performance improvements over both components.</p>

    <h3>Investigating Multimodal Features for Video Recommendations at Globoplay (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Ferreira</p>
    <p>Globoplay is Globo Group’s digital video streaming platform and offers a very diverse video content catalogue ranging from international to brazilian productions such as movies, series, soap operas, and TV programs produced by Globo Group. One of the challenges with such large and diverse content collection is its distribution to the user base in order to help our subscribers with finding relevant content that meets their expectations and to increase their engagement with the product. In this work, we show the result of a content-based recommendation approach based on multi-modal features such as visual characteristics and audio patterns found in the video content. Using techniques applied to short videos, we model it as a similarity problem based on the content of the video, where, given a video, we establish the top-n videos most similar to it in the collection. For the evaluation, we conducted a study through interviews with a group of users to understand their perception of recommendations based on audiovisual characteristics. For the future, we plan to: explore and define the best approach to combine text, audio and video features for video recommendations; explore audiovisual features with other recommendation approaches such as session based and collaborative filtering; perform AB testing in production; and evaluate the proposal impact in business metrics.</p>
