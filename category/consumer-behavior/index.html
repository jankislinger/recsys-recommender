    <h3>Modeling the Assimilation-Contrast Effects in Online Product Rating Systems: Debiasing and Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junzhou Zhao, Xiaoying Zhang, John C.S. Lui</p>
    <p>The unbiasedness of online product ratings, an important property to ensure that users’ ratings indeed reflect their true evaluations to products, is vital both in shaping consumer purchase decisions and providing reliable recommendations. Recent experimental studies showed that distortions from historical ratings would ruin the unbiasedness of subsequent ratings. How to “discover” the distortions from historical ratings in each single rating (or at the micro-level), and perform the “de-biasing operations” in real rating systems are the main objectives of this work. Using 42 million real customer ratings, we first show that users either “assimilate” or “contrast” to historical ratings under different scenarios: users conform to historical ratings if historical ratings are not far from the product quality (assimilation), while users deviate from historical ratings if they are significantly different from the product quality (contrast). This phenomenon can be explained by the well-known psychological argument: the “Assimilate-Contrast” theory. However, none of the existing works on modeling historical ratings’ influence have taken this into account, and this motivates us to propose the Historical Influence Aware Latent Factor Model (HIALF), the first model for real rating systems to capture and mitigate historical distortions in each single rating. HIALF also allows us to study the influence patterns of historical ratings from a modeling perspective, and it perfectly matches the assimilation and contrast effects we previously observed. Also, HIALF achieves significant improvements in predicting subsequent ratings, and accurately predicts the relationships revealed in previous empirical measurements on real ratings. Finally, we show that HIALF can contribute to better recommendations by decoupling users’ real preference from distorted ratings, and reveal the intrinsic product quality for wiser consumer purchase decisions.</p>

    <h3>How Diverse Is Your Audience? Exploring Consumer Diversity in Recommender Systems (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacek Wasilewski, Neil Hurley</p>
    <p>On-line recommender systems have different challenges to overcome to provide content to users. One of these is the potential of isolating users from a diverse set of items by recommending very narrow content. In this paper we propose an item-centric view of a recommender system, looking at the exposure of items to groups of consumers, and how diverse those groups are, to identify if items are recommended to narrower groups of consumers. This is opposite to current practice where diversity of content is typically analysed. Preliminary results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that recommender systems expose items to narrower groups of consumers, and these groups are less diverse.</p>

    <h3>The Value of Online Customer Reviews (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward C. Malthouse, Georgios Askalidis</p>
    <p>We study the effect of the volume of consumer reviews on the purchase likelihood (conversion rate) of users browsing a product page. We propose using the exponential learning curve model to study how conversion rates change with the number of reviews. We call the difference in conversion rate between having no reviews and an infinite number the value of reviews. We find that, on average, the conversion rate of a product can increase by as much as 270% as it accumulates reviews, amongst the users that choose to display them. We also find diminishing marginal value as a product accumu- lates reviews, with the first five reviews driving the bulk of the aforementioned increase. To address the problem of si- multaneity of increase of reviews and conversion rate, we use customer sessions in which reviews were not displayed as a control for trends that would have happened regardless of the increase in the review volume. Using our framework, we further find that high priced items have a higher value for reviews than lower priced items. High priced items can see their conversion rate increase by as much as 380% as they accumulate reviews compared to 190% for low priced items.We infer that the existence of reviews provides valu- able signals to the customers, increasing their propensity to purchase. We also infer that users usually don’t pay atten- tion to the entire set of reviews, especially if there are a lot of them, but instead they focus on the first few available. Our approach can be extended and applied in a variety of settings to gain further insights.</p>
