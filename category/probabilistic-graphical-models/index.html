    <h3>An Insurance Recommendation System Using Bayesian Networks (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katie J. Meissner, Glenn M. Fung, Maleeha Qazi, Eduardo R. Fontes</p>
    <p>In this paper we describe a deployed recommender system to predict insurance products for new and existing customers. Our goal is to give our customers personalized recommendations based on what other similar people with similar portfolios have, in order to make sure they were adequately covered for their needs. Our system uses customer characteristics in addition to customer portfolio data. Since the number of possible recommendable products is relatively small compared to other recommender domains and missing data is relatively frequent, we chose to use Bayesian Networks for modeling our system. Experimental results show advantages of using probabilistic graphical models over the widely used low-rank matrix factorization model for the insurance domain.</p>

    <h3>Joint User Modeling across Aligned Heterogeneous Sites (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuezhi Cao, Yong Yu</p>
    <p>An accurate and comprehensive user modeling technique is crucial for the quality of recommender systems. Traditionally, we model user preferences using only actions from the target site and may suffer from cold-start problem. As nowadays people normally engage in multiple online sites for various needs, we consider leveraging the cross-site actions to improve the user modeling accuracy. Specifically, in this paper we aim at achieving a more comprehensive and accurate user modeling by modeling userâ€™s actions in multiple aligned heterogeneous sites simultaneously. To do so, we propose a modularized probabilistic graphical model framework JUMA. We further integrate topic model and matrix factorization into JUMA for joint user modeling over text-based and item-based sites. We assemble and publish large-scale dataset for comprehensive analyzing and evaluation. Experimental results show that our framework JUMA out performs traditional within-site user modeling techniques, especially for cold-start scenarios. For cold-start users, we achieve relative improvements of 9.3% and 12.8% comparing to existing within-site approaches for recommendation in item-based and text-based sites respectively. Thus we draw the conclusion that aligning heterogeneous sites and modeling users jointly do help to improve the quality of online recommender systems.</p>
