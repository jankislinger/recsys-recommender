    <h3>Towards Sustainable Recommendations in Urban Tourism (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel Merinov</p>
    <p>In the context of urban tourism promotion, I am exploring how recommender systems (RSs) can personalise information in order to shift tourists behaviour from typically popularity-biased towards more niche and urban-friendly. This problem has a great importance in sustainability online promotion campaigns. Urban destination managers strive to prevent overcrowding at popular points of interest (POIs), by attracting visitors to less popular POIs, while still providing personalised access to information. It is assumed, that this approach will maintain a healthy distribution of tourists in a city; both reducing tourist congestion, and, considering each POI as a local business, maintaining the long-term economic viability in a city. This problem has already received some attention in the literature, targeting major European touristic cities. However, many complex issues still need to be resolved for a comprehensive solution. In this extended abstract, I highlight open research problems, and identify key research questions (RQs) that are crucial for advancing sustainable tourism development leveraging RSs. Although the proposed methods are focused on urban tourism, their application extends to different areas of recommendations because the RQs and the proposed methods and techniques are general.</p>

    <h3>Adversarial Collaborative Filtering for Free (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chin-Chia Michael Yeh, Vivian Lai, Yan Zheng, Hao Yang, Mahashweta Das, Yujie Fan, Xiaoting Li, Huiyuan Chen</p>
    <p>Collaborative Filtering (CF) has been successfully applied to help users discover the items of interest. Nevertheless, existing CF methods suffer from noisy data issue, which negatively impacts the quality of personalized recommendation. To tackle this problem, many  prior studies leverage the adversarial learning principle to regularize the representations of users and items, which  has shown great ability in improving both generalizability and robustness. Generally, those methods  learn adversarial perturbations and model parameters using min-max optimization framework. However, there still have two major limitations: 1) Existing methods lack theoretical guarantees of why adding perturbations improve the model generalizability and robustness since noisy data is naturally different from adversarial attacks; 2)  Solving min-max optimization is time-consuming.  In addition to updating the model parameters, each iteration requires additional computations to update the perturbations, making them not scalable for industry-scale datasets. In this paper, we present Sharpness-aware Matrix Factorization (SharpMF), a simple yet effective method that conducts adversarial training without extra computational cost over the base optimizer. To achieve this goal, we first revisit the existing adversarial collaborative filtering and discuss its connection with recent Sharpness-aware Minimization. This analysis shows that adversarial training actually seeks model parameters that lie in neighborhoods having uniformly low loss values, resulting in better generalizability. To reduce the computational overhead, SharpMF introduces a novel trajectory loss to measure sharpness between current weights and past weights. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our SharpMF achieves superior performance with almost zero additional computational cost comparing to adversarial training.</p>

    <h3>Generic Automated Lead Ranking in Dynamics CRM (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Royi Ronen, Edan Hauon, Gopal Kasturi, AJ Ezzour, Oron Nir, Hilik Berezin, Rotem Preizler, Sayalee Bhanavase</p>
    <p>We developed a generic framework which enables Customer Relationship Management (CRM) organizations to deploy an automated ranking system for leads (commonly known as ‘lead scoring’). Leads are records that represent non-customers who might become customers. Lead ranking is a fundamental CRM problem with many flavors. Ranking serves as a prioritization management tool for CRM organizations, with many characteristics similar to those of recommender systems.<br>We present the system with its most recent developments, emphasizing challenges that go beyond the core of the learning algorithm, and that have played an instrumental role in maturing the system into a trustable feature, robust to different types of organizations and datasets. Particularly, we present features which enable Human in the Loop [1], a dominant concept in both configuration and result consumption. Another type of features demonstrates the addition of domain knowledge into the machine learning based process.<br>We present the concepts of feature selection, with and without human help, prediction explanations, insights on model inputs, data quality issues, training for UX consistency, and actionability for each individual prediction.</p>

    <h3>A Pareto-Efficient Algorithm for Multiple Objective Optimization in E-Commerce Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Jiang, Hongjie Chen, Yongfeng Zhang, Hanxiao Sun, Wenwu Ou, Xuanji Xiao, Xiao Lin, Changhua Pei, Fei Sun</p>
    <p>Recommendation with multiple objectives is an important but difficult problem, where the coherent difficulty lies in the possible conflicts between objectives. In this case, multi-objective optimization is expected to be Pareto efficient, where no single objective can be further improved without hurting the others. However existing approaches to Pareto efficient multi-objective recommendation still lack good theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a general framework for generating Pareto efficient recommendations. Assuming that there are formal differentiable formulations for the objectives, we coordinate these objectives with a weighted aggregation. Then we propose a condition ensuring Pareto efficiency theoretically and a two-step Pareto efficient optimization algorithm. Meanwhile the algorithm can be easily adapted for Pareto Frontier generation and fair recommendation selection. We specifically apply the proposed framework on E-Commerce recommendation to optimize GMV and CTR simultaneously. Extensive online and offline experiments are conducted on the real-world E-Commerce recommender system and the results validate the Pareto efficiency of the framework. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to provide a Pareto efficient framework for multi-objective recommendation with theoretical guarantees. Moreover, the framework can be applied to any other objectives with differentiable formulations and any model with gradients, which shows its strong scalability.</p>

    <h3>Categorical-Attributes-Based Item Classification for Recommender Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jilin Chen, Minmin Chen, Alex Beutel, Ed Chi, Francois Belletti, Sagar Jain, Qian Zhao</p>
    <p>Many techniques to utilize side information of users and/or items as inputs to recommenders to improve recommendation, especially on cold-start items/users, have been developed over the years. In this work, we test the approach of utilizing item side information, specifically categorical attributes, in the output of recommendation models either through multi-task learning or hierarchical classification. We first demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches for both matrix factorization and neural networks with a medium-size real-word data set. We then show that they improve a neural-network based production model in an industrial-scale recommender system. We demonstrate the robustness of the hierarchical classification approach by introducing noise in building the hierarchy. Lastly, we investigate the generalizability of hierarchical classification on a simulated dataset by building two user models in which we can fully control the generative process of user-item interactions.</p>
