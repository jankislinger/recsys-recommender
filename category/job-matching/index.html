    <h3>ConFit: Improving Resume-Job Matching using Data Augmentation and Contrastive Learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhou Yu, Jinzhong Zhang, Xiao Yu</p>
    <p>A reliable resume-job matching system helps a company find suitable candidates from a pool of resumes, and helps a job seeker find relevant jobs from a list of job posts. However, since job seekers apply only to a few jobs, interaction records in resume-job datasets are sparse. Different from many prior work that use complex modeling techniques, we tackle this sparsity problem using data augmentations and a simple contrastive learning approach. ConFit first formulates resume-job datasets as a sparse bipartite graph, and creates an augmented dataset by paraphrasing specific sections in a resume or a job post. Then, ConFit finetunes pre-trained encoders with contrastive learning to further increase training samples from B pairs per batch to O(B^2) per batch. We evaluate ConFit on two real-world datasets and find it outperforms prior methods (including BM25 and OpenAI text-ada-002) by up to 19% and 31% absolute in nDCG@10 for ranking jobs and ranking resumes, respectively. We believe ConFit’s simple yet highly performant approach lays a strong foundation for future research in modeling person-job fit.</p>

    <h3>An Exploration of Sentence-Pair Classification for Algorithmic Recruiting (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toine Bogers, Mesut Kaya</p>
    <p>Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the application of computational approaches to different HR tasks, such as algorithmic hiring, skill extraction, and monitoring of employee satisfaction. Much of the recent work on estimating the fit between a person and a job has used representation learning to represent both resumes and job vacancies computationally and determine the degree to which they match. A common approach to this task is Sentence-BERT, which uses a Siamese network to encode resumes and job descriptions into fixed-length vectors and estimates how well they match based on the similarity between those vectors. In our paper, we adapt BERT’s next-sentence prediction task—predicting whether one sentence is likely to follow another in a given context—to the task of matching resumes with job descriptions. Using historical data on past (mis)matches between job-resume pairs, we fine-tune BERT for this downstream task. Through a combination of offline and online experiments on data from a large Scandinavian job portal, we show that this approach performs significantly better than Sentence-BERT and other state-of-the-art approaches for determining person-job fit.</p>
