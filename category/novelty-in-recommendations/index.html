    <h3>Leveraging Multi-Faceted User Preferences for Improving Click-Through Rate Predictions (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan Li</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have been widely adopted by many firms across various industries over the past decade, as they could provide numerous economic benefits to the industry, such as influencing consumer choices, generating the lift in sales, and enhancing consumer trust. Many currently-deployed recommender systems primiarily optimize the similarity measure following the Collaborative Filtering paradigm during the recommendation performance, which focuses on the matching between targeted users and items of their interests. Although effective and useful in many cases, these still face several important challenges to fully address consumers’ concerns. In particular, they usually provide recommendations of the most similar items related to the consumption records, without taking into account the multi-faceted consumer preferences. For example, some consumers would be satisfied to receive recommendations that are novel and unexpected to broaden their horizons, while others might be interested to receive recommendations from other product categories to expand their interests. Falling to do so would lead to the filter bubble and exploration-exploitation trade-off phenomenon, which is undesirable because it would significantly reduce sales diversity and deteriorate user satisfaction with recommender systems.<br>In my thesis proposal, I will describe new methods to design recommender systems following two research streams to tackle the aforementioned challenges, namely unexpected recommender system and cross-domain system. In particular, unexpected recommender systems address consumers’ desire for variety, and aim at providing novel and useful recommendations simultaneously, while cross-domain recommender systems learn consumer preferences from their behaviors in other domains to better predict their behaviors in the target domain. The proposed models are capable of significantly improving recommendation performance and user satisfaction, as demonstrated through extensive offline and online experiments discussed in this proposal.</p>

    <h3>Style Conditioned Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamelia Aryafar, Murium Iqbal, Timothy Anderton</p>
    <p>We propose Style Conditioned Recommendations (SCR) and introduce style injection as a method to diversify recommendations. We use Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) architecture, where both the encoder and decoder are conditioned on a user profile learned from item content data. This allows us to apply style transfer methodologies to the task of recommendations, which we refer to as injection. To enable style injection, user profiles are learned to be interpretable such that they express users’ propensities for specific predefined styles. These are learned via label-propagation from a dataset of item content, with limited labeled points. To perform injection, the condition on the encoder is learned while the condition on the decoder is selected per explicit feedback. Explicit feedback can be taken either from a user’s response to a style or interest quiz, or from item ratings. In the absence of explicit feedback, the condition at the encoder is applied to the decoder. We show a 12% improvement on NDCG@20 over the traditional VAE based approach on the task of recommendations. We show an average 22% improvement on AUC across all classes for predicting user style profiles against our best performing baseline. After injecting styles we compare the user style profile to the style of the recommendations and show that injected styles have an average +133% increase in presence. Our results show that style injection is a powerful method to diversify recommendations while maintaining personal relevance. Our main contribution is an application of a semi-supervised approach that extends item labels to interpretable user profiles.</p>

    <h3>Harnessing A Generalised User Behaviour Model for Next-POI Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Massimo, Francesco Ricci</p>
    <p>Recommender Systems (RSs) are commonly used in web applications to support users in finding items of their interest. In this paper we propose a novel RS approach to support human decision making by leveraging data acquired in the physical world. We focus on the tourism domain and we consider a scenario in which users’ choices, i.e., visit to points of interests (POIs), are tracked and used to generate recommendations for not yet visited POIs. We propose a novel approach to behaviour modelling that is based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). On top of this we propose two, non trivial, strategies for generating interesting recommendations, i.e., that differ from the straight next action prediction usually performed by state of the art models. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach outperforms state of the art models in terms of overall utility the user gains by following the provided recommendations and novelty of the newly recommended items.</p>

    <h3>‘I like to explore sometimes’: Adapting to Dynamic User Novelty Preferences (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vikas Kumar, Joseph A. Konstan, Loren Terveen, Paul Schrater, Komal Kapoor</p>
    <p>Studies have shown that the recommendation of unseen, novel or serendipitous items is crucial for a satisfying and engaging user experience. As a result, recent developments in recommendation research have increasingly focused towards introducing novelty in user recommendation lists. While, existing solutions aim to ﬁnd the right balance between the similarity and novelty of the recommended items, they largely ignore the user needs for novelty. In this paper, we show that there are large individual and temporal differences in the users’ novelty preferences. We develop a regression model to predict these dynamic novelty preferences of users using features derived from their past interactions. Finally, we describe an adaptive recommender, , that adapts to the user needs for novel items and show that the model achieves better recommendation performance on a metric that considers both novel and familiar items.</p>

    <h3>User Perception of Differences in Movie Recommendation Algorithms (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martijn Willemsen, F. Maxwell Harper, Michael Ekstrand, Joseph Konstan</p>
    <p>Recent developments in user evaluation of recommender systems have brought forth powerful new tools for understanding what makes recommendations effective and useful. We apply these methods to understand how users evaluate recommendation lists for the purpose of selecting an algorithm for finding movies. This paper reports on an experiment in which we asked users to compare lists produced by three common collaborative filtering algorithms on the dimensions of novelty, diversity, accuracy, satisfaction, and degree of personalization, and to select a recommender that they would like to use in the future. We find that satisfaction is negatively dependent on novelty and positively dependent on diversity in this setting, and that satisfaction predicts the user’s final selection. We also compare users’ subjective perceptions of recommendation properties with objective measures of those same characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first study that applies modern survey design and analysis techniques to a within-subjects, direct comparison study of recommender algorithms.</p>
