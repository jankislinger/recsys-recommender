    <h3>Context-based Entity Recommendation for Knowledge Workers: Establishing a Benchmark on Real-life Data (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahta Bakhshizadeh, Heiko Maus, Andreas Dengel</p>
    <p>In recent decades, recommender systems have undergone significant advancements, particularly in popular domains like movies, music, and product recommendations. Yet, progress has been notably slower in leveraging these systems for personal information management and knowledge assistance. In addition to challenges that complicate the adoption of recommender systems in this domain (such as privacy concerns, heterogeneous recommendation items, and frequent context switching), a significant barrier to progress in this area has been the absence of a standardized benchmark for researchers to evaluate their approaches. In response to this gap, this paper presents a benchmark built upon a publicly available dataset of real-life knowledge work in context (RLKWiC). This benchmark focuses on evaluating context-based entity recommendation, a use case for leveraging recommender systems to support knowledge workers in their daily digital tasks. By providing this benchmark, it is aimed to facilitate and accelerate research efforts in enhancing personal knowledge assistance through recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Exploring Unlearning Methods to Ensure the Privacy, Security, and Usability of Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jens Leysen</p>
    <p>Machine learning algorithms have proven highly effective in analyzing large amounts of data and identifying complex patterns and relationships. One application of machine learning that has received significant attention in recent years is recommender systems, which are algorithms that analyze user behavior and other data to suggest items or content that a user may be interested in. However useful, these systems may unintentionally retain sensitive, outdated, or faulty information. Posing a risk to user privacy, system security, and limiting a system’s usability. In this research proposal, we aim to address these challenges by investigating methods for machine “unlearning”, which would allow information to be efficiently “forgotten” or “unlearned” from machine learning models. The main objective of this proposal is to develop the foundation for future machine unlearning methods. We first evaluate current unlearning methods and explore novel adversarial attacks on these methods’ verifiability, efficiency, and accuracy to gain new insights and further develop the theory of machine unlearning. Using our gathered insights, we seek to create novel unlearning methods that are verifiable, efficient, and limit unnecessary accuracy degradation. Through this research, we seek to make significant contributions to the theoretical foundations of machine unlearning while also developing unlearning methods that can be applied to real-world problems.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Global Sensitivity for Differentially Private Contextual Bandits (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongning Wang, David B. Zhao, Huazheng Wang</p>
    <p>Bandit algorithms have become a reference solution for interactive recommendation. However, as such algorithms directly interact with users for improved recommendations, serious privacy concerns have been raised regarding its practical use. In this work, we propose a differentially private linear contextual bandit algorithm, via a tree-based mechanism to add Laplace or Gaussian noise to model parameters. Our key insight is that as the model converges during online update, the global sensitivity of its parameters shrinks over time (thus named dynamic global sensitivity). Compared with existing solutions, our dynamic global sensitivity analysis allows us to inject less noise to obtain (ϵ, δ)-differential privacy with added regret caused by noise injection in . We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis over the amount of noise added via dynamic global sensitivity and the corresponding upper regret bound of our proposed algorithm. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets confirmed the algorithm’s advantage against existing solutions.</p>

    <h3>A Federated Recommender System for Online Services (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Tan, Qiang Yang, Vincent Zheng, Bo Liu</p>
    <p>Due to privacy and security constraints, directly sharing user data between parties is undesired. Such decentralized data silo issues commonly exist in recommender systems. In general, recommender systems are data-driven. The more data it uses, the better performance it obtains. The data silo issues is a severe limitation of the recommender’s performance. Federated learning is an emerging technology, which bridges the data silos and builds machine learning models without compromising user privacy and data security. We design a recommender system based on federated learning. It is known as the federated recommender system. The system implements plenty of popular algorithms to support various online recommendation services. The algorithm implementation is open-sourced. We also deploy the system on a real-world content recommendation application, achieving significant performance improvement. In this demonstration, we present the architecture of the federated recommender system and give an online demo to show its detailed working procedures and results in content recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Find My Next Job Labor Market Recommendations Using Administrative Big Data (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Snorre S. Frid-Nielsen</p>
    <p>Labor markets are undergoing change due to factors such as automatization and globalization, motivating the development of occupational recommender systems for jobseekers and caseworkers. This study generates occupational recommendations by utilizing a novel data set consisting of administrative records covering the entire Danish workforce. Based on actual labor market behavior in the period 2012-2015, how well can different models predict each users’ next occupation in 2016? Through offline experiments, the study finds that gradient-boosted decision tree models provide the best recommendations for future occupations in terms of mean reciprocal ranking and recall. Further, gradient-boosted decision tree models offer distinct advantages in the labor market domain due to their interpretability and ability to harness additional background information on workers. However, the study raises concerns regarding trade-offs between model accuracy and ethical issues, including privacy and the social reinforcement of gender divides. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>A Secure Shopping Experience Based on Blockchain and Beacon Technology (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Vučkovac, Remo Manuel Frey, Alexander Ilic</p>
    <p>The present work proposes a novel approach for a future shopping system. Customers’ personal data are protected by a blockchain-based storage network. Based on the bitcoin protocol, the system transacts encrypted data in a tamper-proof way and is able to run secure multiparty computations while no one but the data owner has access to the input data. Thus, a potential customer is able to allow a company to apply functions like a recommendation algorithm without revealing personal data. In combination with a low-energy transmitter (beacon), a completely new shopping experience arises. The beacon automatically triggers a recommendation process based on encrypted personal data. The resulting outcome is a recommendation system, a self-checkout system, and a payment system all in one, thereby full anonymity is guaranteed and the customer never lose control on her data.</p>

    <h3>Recommending with an Agenda: Active Learning of Private Attributes using Matrix Factorization (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Smriti Bhagat, Nina Taft, Udi Weinsberg, Stratis Ioannidis</p>
    <p>Recommender systems leverage user demographic information, such as age, gender, etc., to personalize recommendations and better place their targeted ads. Oftentimes, users do not volunteer this information due to privacy concerns, or due to a lack of initiative in filling out their online profiles. We illustrate a new threat in which a recommender learns private attributes of users who do not voluntarily disclose them. We design both passive and active attacks that so- licit ratings for strategically selected items, and could thus be used by a recommender system to pursue this hidden agenda. Our methods are based on a novel usage of Bayesian matrix factorization in an active learning setting. Evaluations on multiple datasets illustrate that such attacks are indeed feasible and use significantly fewer rated items than static inference methods. Importantly, they succeed without sacrificing the quality of recommendations to users.</p>
