    <h3>Enhanced Privacy Preservation for Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziqing Wu</p>
    <p>My research focuses on privacy preservation for recommender systems specifically in the following aspects: first, how to better address users’ realistic privacy concerns and offer enhanced privacy control by considering what and with whom to share sensitive information for decentralized recommender systems; second, how to enhance the privacy preservation capability of LLM-based recommender systems; last, how to formulate uniform metrics to compare the privacy-preservation efficacy of the recommender system.</p>

    <h3>Accelerating Creator Audience Building through Centralized Exploration (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilherme Dinis Junior, Olayinka S. Folorunso, Gösta Forsum, Maksym Lefarov, Lucas Maystre, Antonina Danylenko, Buket Baran, Yu Zhao</p>
    <p>On Spotify, multiple recommender systems enable personalized user experiences across a wide range of product features. These systems are owned by different teams and serve different goals, but all of these systems need to explore and learn about new content as it appears on the platform. In this work, we describe ongoing efforts at Spotify to develop an efficient solution to this problem, by centralizing content exploration and providing signals to existing, decentralized recommendation systems (a.k.a. exploitation systems). We take a creator-centric perspective, and argue that this approach can dramatically reduce the time it takes for new content to reach its full potential.</p>

    <h3>A Secure Shopping Experience Based on Blockchain and Beacon Technology (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Vučkovac, Remo Manuel Frey, Alexander Ilic</p>
    <p>The present work proposes a novel approach for a future shopping system. Customers’ personal data are protected by a blockchain-based storage network. Based on the bitcoin protocol, the system transacts encrypted data in a tamper-proof way and is able to run secure multiparty computations while no one but the data owner has access to the input data. Thus, a potential customer is able to allow a company to apply functions like a recommendation algorithm without revealing personal data. In combination with a low-energy transmitter (beacon), a completely new shopping experience arises. The beacon automatically triggers a recommendation process based on encrypted personal data. The resulting outcome is a recommendation system, a self-checkout system, and a payment system all in one, thereby full anonymity is guaranteed and the customer never lose control on her data.</p>
