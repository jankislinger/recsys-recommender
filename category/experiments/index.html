    <h3>Long-tail Session-based Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyi Liu, Yujia Zheng</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendation focuses on the prediction of user actions based on anonymous sessions and is a necessary method in the lack of user historical data. However, none of the existing session-based recommendation methods explicitly takes the long-tail recommendation into consideration, which plays an important role in improving the diversity of recommendation and producing the serendipity. As the distribution of items with long-tail is prevalent in session-based recommendation scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, music, and TV program recommendations), more attention should be put on the long-tail session-based recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture, namely TailNet, to improve long-tail recommendation performance, while maintaining competitive accuracy performance compared with other methods. We start by classifying items into short-head (popular) and long-tail (niche) items based on click frequency. Then a novel preference mechanism is proposed and applied in TailNet to determine user preference between two types of items, so as to softly adjust and personalize recommendations. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art works.</p>

    <h3>Preference Elicitation as an Optimization Problem (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filip Radlinski, Maarten de Rijke, Julia Kiseleva, Anna Sepliarskaia</p>
    <p>The new user cold-start problem arises when a recommender system does not yet have any information about a user. A common solution to this problem is to generate a user profile as part of the sign-up process, by asking the user to rate several items. We propose a new elicitation method to generate a static preference questionnaire (SPQ) that asks a new user to make pairwise comparisons between items by posing relative preference questions. Using a latent factor model, SPQ improves personalized recommendations by choosing a minimal and diverse set of static preference questions to ask any new user. We are the first to rigorously prove which optimization task should be solved in order to select the next preference question for static questionnaires. Our theoretical results are confirmed by extensive experimentation. We test the performance of SPQ on two real-world datasets, under two experimental conditions: simulated, when users behave according to LFM, and real, in which there is no user rating model. SPQ reduces the questionnaire length that is necessary to make accurate recommendations for new users by up to a factor of three compared to state-of-the-art preference elicitation methods. Moreover, solving the right optimization task, SPQ shows better performance than baselines with dynamically generated questions.</p>

    <h3>Quality-Aware Neural Complementary Item Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Caverlee, Wei Niu, Haokai Lu, Yin Zhang</p>
    <p>Complementary item recommendation finds products that go well with one another (e.g., a camera and a specific lens). While they are ubiquitous, the dimensions by which items go together can vary by both product and category, making it difficult to detect complementary items at scale. Moreover, in practice, user preferences for complementary items can be complex combinations of item quality and evidence of complementarity. Hence, we propose a new neural complementary recommender Encore that can jointly learn complementary item relationships and user preferences. Specifically, Encore (i) effectively combines and balances both stylistic and functional evidence of complementary items across item categories; (ii) naturally models item latent quality for complementary items through Bayesian inference of customer ratings; and (iii) builds a novel neural network model to learn the complex (non-linear) relationships between items for flexible and scalable complementary product recommendations. Through experiments over large Amazon datasets, we find that Encore effectively learns complementary item relationships, leading to an improvement in accuracy of 15.5% on average versus the next-best alternative.</p>

    <h3>Personalized Recommendations using Knowledge Graphs: A Probabilistic Logic Programming Approach (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William Cohen, Rose Catherine</p>
    <p>Improving the performance of recommender systems using knowledge graphs is an important task. There have been many hybrid systems proposed in the past that use a mix of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to boost the performance. More recently, some work has focused on recommendations that use external knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement content-based recommendation. In this paper, we investigate three methods for making KG based recommendations using a general-purpose probabilistic logic system called ProPPR. The simplest of the models, EntitySim, uses only the links of the graph. We then extend the model to TypeSim that also uses the types of the entities to boost its generalization capabilities. Next, we develop a graph based latent factor model, GraphLF, which combines the strengths of latent factorization with graphs. We compare our approaches to a recently proposed state-of-the-art graph recommendation method on two large datasets, Yelp and MovieLens-100K. The experiments illustrate that our approaches can give large performance improvements. Additionally, we demonstrate that knowledge graphs give maximum advantage when the dataset is sparse, and gradually become redundant as more training data becomes available, and hence are most useful in cold-start settings.</p>
