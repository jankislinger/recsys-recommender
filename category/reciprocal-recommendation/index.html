    <h3>Fair Reciprocal Recommendation in Matching Markets (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoji Tomita, Tomohiko Yokoyama</p>
    <p>Recommender systems play an increasingly crucial role in shaping people’s opportunities, particularly in online dating platforms. It is essential from the user’s perspective to increase the probability of matching with a suitable partner while ensuring an appropriate level of fairness in the matching opportunities. We investigate reciprocal recommendation in two-sided matching markets between agents divided into two sides (e.g., men and women). We assume that a successful match requires mutual interest from both men and women involved, and agents would desire to be positioned favorably in the others’ the recommendation lists. We define each agent’s opportunity to be recommended and introduce its fairness criterion, envy-freeness, from the perspective of the fair division theory. The recommendations that approximately maximize the expected number of matches between men and women, empirically obtained by heuristic algorithms, are likely to result in significant unfairness of opportunity. Therefore, there can be a trade-off between maximizing the expected matches and ensuring fairness of opportunity. We propose a method to find a policy that is close to being envy-free by leveraging the Nash social welfare function. Experiments on synthetic and a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving both relatively high expected matches and fairness for opportunities of both men and women in reciprocal recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Reciprocal Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Zheng, Hengshu Zhu, Yang Song, Wayne Xin Zhao, Yupeng Hou</p>
    <p>Reciprocal recommender system (RRS), considering a two-way matching between two parties, has been widely applied in online platforms like online dating and recruitment. Existing RRS models mainly capture static user preferences, which have neglected the evolving user tastes and the dynamic matching relation between the two parties. Although dynamic user modeling has been well-studied in sequential recommender systems, existing solutions are developed in a user-oriented manner. Therefore, it is non-trivial to adapt sequential recommendation algorithms to reciprocal recommendation. In this paper, we formulate RRS as a distinctive sequence matching task, and further propose a new approach ReSeq for RRS, which is short for Reciprocal Sequential recommendation. To capture duel-perspective matching, we propose to learn fine-grained sequence similarities by co-attention mechanism across different time steps. Further, to improve the inference efficiency, we introduce the self-distillation technique to distill knowledge from the fine-grained matching module into the more efficient student module. In the deployment stage, only the efficient student module is used, greatly speeding up the similarity computation. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets from two scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReSeq/.</p>

    <h3>Fast and Examination-agnostic Reciprocal Recommendation in Matching Markets (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoji Tomita, Riku Togashi, Yuriko Hashizume, Naoto Ohsaka</p>
    <p>n matching markets such as job posting and online dating platforms, the recommender system plays a critical role in the success of the platform. Unlike standard recommender systems that suggest items to users, reciprocal recommender systems (RRSs) that suggest other users must take into account the mutual interests of users. In addition, ensuring that recommendation opportunities do not disproportionately favor popular users is essential for the total number of matches and for fairness among users. Existing recommendation methods in matching markets, however, face computational challenges on large-scale platforms and depend on specific examination functions in the position-based model (PBM). In this paper, we introduce the reciprocal recommendation method based on the matching with transferable utility (TU matching) model in the context of ranking recommendations in matching markets and propose a fast and examination-model-free algorithm. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach on experiments with synthetic data and real-world data from an online dating platform in Japan. Our method performs better than or as well as existing methods in terms of the number of total matches and works well even in a large-scale dataset for which one existing method does not work.</p>
