    <h3>Biased User History Synthesis for Personalized Long-Tail Item Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elan Markowitz, Greg Ver Steeg, Abdulla Alshabanah, Keshav Balasubramanian, Murali Annavaram</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems connect users to items and create value chains in the internet economy. Recommendation systems learn from past user-item interaction histories. As such, items that have short interaction histories, either because they are new or not popular, are disproportionately under-recommended. This long-tail item problem can exacerbate model bias, and reinforce poor recommendation of tail items. In this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm, <i>biased user history synthesis</i>, to not only address this problem but also achieve better personalization in recommendation systems. As a result, we concurrently improve tail and head item recommendation performance. Our approach is built on a tail item biased User Interaction History (UIH) sampling strategy and a synthesis model that produces an augmented user representation from the sampled user history. We provide a theoretical justification for our approach using information theory and demonstrate through extensive experimentation, that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on tail, head, and overall recommendation. the source code is available at https://github.com/lkp411/BiasedUserHistorySynthesis.</p>

    <h3>Weighted Random Walks for Meta-Path Expansion in Heterogeneous Networks (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fatemeh Vahedian, Bamshad Mobasher, Robin Burke</p>
    <p>In social networks, users and items are joined in a complex web of relations, which can be modeled as heterogeneous information networks. Such networks include a variety of object types and the rich relations among them. Recent research has shown that a hybrid recommendation approach combining components built from extended meta-paths in the network can improve the accuracy of recommendations in such networks. However most of this recent work is focused on unweighted heterogeneous networks, and simplifying relations by ignoring weight (including user ratings) loses important information. We propose a random walk based model to generate meta-paths in weighted heterogeneous network in which the frequency of edge sampling is a function of edge weight, and demonstrate that performance is improved using this method.</p>
