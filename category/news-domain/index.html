    <h3>Enhancing Cross-Domain Recommender Systems with LLMs: Evaluating Bias and Beyond-Accuracy Measures (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Elmar Kolb</p>
    <p>The research domain of recommender systems is rapidly evolving. Initially, optimization efforts focused primarily on accuracy. However, recent research has highlighted the importance of addressing bias and beyond-accuracy measures such as novelty, diversity, and serendipity. With the rise of multi-domain recommender systems, the need to re-examine bias and beyond-accuracy measures in cross-domain settings has become crucial. Traditional methods face challenges such as cold-start problems, which can potentially be mitigated by leveraging LLMs. This proposed work investigates how LLM-based recommendation methods can enhance cross-domain recommender systems, focusing on identifying, measuring, and mitigating bias while evaluating the impact of beyond-accuracy measures. We aim to provide new insights by comparing traditional and LLM-based systems within a real-world environment encompassing the domains of news, books, and various lifestyle areas. Our research seeks to address the outlined gaps and develop effective evaluation strategies for the unique challenges posed by LLMs in cross-domain recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Streaming Session-Based Recommendation: When Graph Neural Networks meet the Neighborhood (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sara Latifi, Dietmar Jannach</p>
    <p>Frequent updates and model retraining are important in various application areas of recommender systems, e.g., news recommendation. Moreover, in such domains, we may not only face the problem of dealing with a constant stream of new data, but also with anonymous users, leading to the problem of streaming session-based recommendation (SSR). Such problem settings have attracted increased interest in recent years, and different deep learning architectures were proposed that support fast updates of the underlying prediction models when new data arrive. In a recent paper, a method based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) was proposed as being superior than previous methods for the SSR problem. The baselines in the reported experiments included different machine learning models. However, several earlier studies have shown that often conceptually simpler methods, e.g., based on nearest neighbors, can be highly effective for session-based recommendation problems. In this work, we report a similar phenomenon for the streaming configuration. We first reproduce the results of the mentioned GNN method and then show that simpler methods are able to outperform this complex state-of-the-art neural method on two datasets. Overall, our work points to continued methodological issues in the academic community, e.g., in terms of the choice of baselines and reproducibility.1</p>

    <h3>Reducing Cross-Topic Political Homogenization in Content-Based News Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aron Culotta, Karthik Shivaram, Matthew Shapiro, Mustafa Bilgic, Ping Liu</p>
    <p>Content-based news recommenders learn words that correlate with user engagement and recommend articles accordingly. This can be problematic for users with diverse political preferences by topic — e.g., users that prefer conservative articles on one topic but liberal articles on another. In such instances, recommenders can have a homogenizing effect by recommending articles with the same political lean on both topics, particularly if both topics share salient, politically polarized terms like “far right” or “radical left.” In this paper, we propose attention-based neural network models to reduce this homogenization effect by increasing attention on words that are topic specific while decreasing attention on polarized, topic-general terms. We find that the proposed approach results in more accurate recommendations for simulated users with such diverse preferences.</p>

    <h3>Predictability Limits in Session-based Next Item Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priit Järv</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendations are based on the user’s recent actions, for example, the items they have viewed during the current browsing session or the sightseeing places they have just visited. Closely related is sequence-aware recommendation, where the choice of the next item should follow from the sequence of previous actions. We study seven benchmarks for session-based recommendation, covering retail, music and news domains to investigate how accurately user behavior can be predicted from the session histories. We measure the entropy rate of the data and estimate the limit of predictability to be between 44% and 73% in the included datasets. We establish some algorithm-specific limits on prediction accuracy for Markov chains, association rules and k-nearest neighbors methods. With most of the analyzed methods, the algorithm design limits their performance with sparse training data. The session based k-nearest neighbors are least restricted in comparison and have room for improvement across all of the analyzed datasets.</p>

    <h3>Designing for the Better by Taking Users into Account: A Qualitative Evaluation of User Control Mechanisms in (News) Recommender Systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaron Harambam, Mykola Makhortykh, Dimitrios Bountouridis, Joris van Hoboken</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RS) are on the rise in many domains. While they offer great promises, they also raise concerns: lack of transparency, reduction of diversity, little to no user control. In this paper, we align with the normative turn in computer science which scrutinizes the ethical and societal implications of RS. We focus and elaborate on the concept of user control because that mitigates multiple problems at once. Taking the news industry as our domain, we conducted four focus groups, or moderated think-aloud sessions, with Dutch news readers (N=21) to systematically study how people evaluate different control mechanisms (at the input, process, and output phase) in a News Recommender Prototype (NRP). While these mechanisms are sometimes met with distrust about the actual control they offer, we found that an intelligible user profile (including reading history and flexible preferences settings), coupled with possibilities to influence the recommendation algorithms is highly valued, especially when these control mechanisms can be operated in relation to achieving personal goals. By bringing (future) users’ perspectives to the fore, this paper contributes to a  richer understanding of why and how to design for user control in recommender systems.</p>
