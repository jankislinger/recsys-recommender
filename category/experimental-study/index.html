    <h3>How Can They Know That? A Study of Factors Affecting the Creepiness of Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Catalin-Mihai Barbu, Jürgen Ziegler, Helma Torkamaan</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RS) often use implicit user preferences extracted from behavioral and contextual data, in addition to traditional rating-based preference elicitation, to increase the quality and accuracy of personalized recommendations. However, these approaches may harm user experience by causing mixed emotions, such as fear, anxiety, surprise, discomfort, or creepiness. RS should consider users’ feelings, expectations, and reactions that result from being shown personalized recommendations. This paper investigates the creepiness of recommendations using an online experiment in three domains: movies, hotels, and health. We define the feeling of creepiness caused by recommendations and find out that it is already known to users of RS. We further find out that the perception of creepiness varies across domains and depends on recommendation features, like causal ambiguity and accuracy. By uncovering possible consequences of creepy recommendations, we also learn that creepiness can have a negative influence on brand and platform attitudes, purchase or consumption intention, user experience, and users’ expectations of‚ and their trust in, RS. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Effects of Personal Characteristics on the Music Recommender with Different Controllability (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nava Tintarev, Katrien Verbert, Yucheng Jin</p>
    <p>Previous research has found that enabling users to control the recommendation process increases user satisfaction with recommendations. However, providing additional controls also increases cognitive load, and different users have different needs for control. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the effect of two personal characteristics: musical sophistication and visual memory capacity. We designed a visual user interface, on top of a commercial music recommender, that incorporates different controls: interactions with recommendations (i.e., the output of a recommender system), the user profile (i.e., the top listened songs), and algorithm parameters (i.e., weights in an algorithm). We created eight experimental settings with all possible combinations of these three user controls and conducted a between-subjects study (N=240), to explore how these controls influence cognitive load and recommendation acceptance for different personal characteristics. We found that controlling recommendations is the most favorable single control element. In addition, controlling recommendations and algorithm parameters is the most beneficial setting with multiple controls. Moreover, the participants with high musical sophistication are more likely to accept recommendations, suggesting that they perceive recommendations to be of higher quality. However, we found no effect of visual working memory on either cognitive load or recommendation acceptance. This work contributes an understanding of how to design control that hit the sweet spot between the perceived quality of recommendations and acceptable cognitive load.</p>
