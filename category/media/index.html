    <h3>Bridging Viewpoints in News with Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia Hua Jeng</p>
    <p>News Recommender systems (NRSs) aid in decision-making in news media. However, undesired effects can emerge. Among these are selective exposures that may contribute to polarization, potentially reinforcing existing attitudes through belief perseverance—discounting contrary evidence due to their opposing attitudinal strength. This can be unsafe for people, making it difficult to accept information objectively. A crucial issue in news recommender system research is how to mitigate these undesired effects by designing recommender interfaces and machine learning models that enable people to consider to be more open to different perspectives. Alongside accurate models, the user experience is an equally important measure. Indeed, the core statistics are based on users’ behaviors and experiences in this research project. Therefore, this research agenda aims to steer the choices of readers’ based on altering their attitudes. The core methods plan to concentrate on the interface design and ML model building involving manipulations of cues, users’ behaviors prediction, NRSs algorithm and changing the nudges. In sum, the project aims to provide insight in the extent to which news recommender systems can be effective in mitigating polarized opinions.</p>

    <h3>AI-based Human-Centered Recommender Systems: Empirical Experiments and Research Infrastructure (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixuan Sun</p>
    <p>This is a dissertation plan built around human-centered empirical experiments evaluating recommender systems (RecSys). We see this as an important research theme since many AI-based RecSys algorithmic studies lack real human assessment. Therefore, we do not know how they work in the wild that only human experiments can tell us. We split this extended abstract into two parts — 1) A series of individual studies focusing on open questions about different human values or recommendation algorithms. Our completed works include user control over content diversity, user appreciation on DL-RecSys algorithms, and human-LLMRec interaction study. We also propose three future works to understand news recommendation depolarization, personalized news podcast, and interactive user representation; 2) An experimentation infrastructure named POPROX. As a personalized news recommendation platform, it aims to support the longitudinal study needs from the general AI and RecSys research community.</p>

    <h3>How Should We Measure Filter Bubbles? A Regression Model and Evidence for Online News (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Verachtert, Jens Leysen, Annelien Smets, Jorre Vannieuwenhuyze, Lien Michiels, Bart Goethals</p>
    <p>News media play an important role in democratic societies.  Central to fulfilling this role is the premise that users should be exposed to diverse news.  However, news recommender systems are gaining popularity on news websites, which has sparked concerns over filter bubbles. Editors, policy-makers and scholars are worried that news recommender systems may expose users to less diverse content over time.  To the best of our knowledge, this hypothesis has not been tested in a longitudinal observational study of real users that interact with a real news website. Such observational studies require the use of research methods that are robust and can account for the many covariates that may influence the diversity of recommendations at any given time. In this work, we propose an analysis model to study whether the variety of articles recommended to a user decreases over time, in observational studies of real news websites with real users. Further, we present results from two case studies using aggregated and anonymized data that were collected by two western European news websites employing a collaborative filtering-based news recommender system to serve (personalized) recommendations to their users. Through these case studies we validate empirically that our modeling assumptions are sound and supported by the data, and that our model obtains more reliable and interpretable results than analysis methods used in prior empirical work on filter bubbles. Our case studies provide evidence of a small decrease in the topic variety of a user’s recommendations in the first weeks after they sign up, but no evidence of a decrease in political variety.</p>

    <h3>Progressive Layered Extraction (PLE): A Novel Multi-Task Learning (MTL) Model for Personalized Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming Zhao, Hongyan Tang, Junning Liu, Xudong Gong</p>
    <p>Multi-task learning (MTL) has been successfully applied to many recommendation applications. However, MTL models often suffer from performance degeneration with negative transfer due to the complex and competing task correlation in real-world recommender systems. Moreover, through extensive experiments across SOTA MTL models, we have observed an interesting seesaw phenomenon that performance of one task is often improved by hurting the performance of some other tasks. To address these issues, we propose a Progressive Layered Extraction (PLE) model with a novel sharing structure design. PLE separates shared components and task-specific components explicitly and adopts a progressive routing mechanism to extract and separate deeper semantic knowledge gradually, improving efficiency of joint representation learning and information routing across tasks in a general setup. We apply PLE to both complicatedly correlated and normally correlated tasks, ranging from two-task cases to multi-task cases on a real-world Tencent video recommendation dataset with 1 billion samples, and results show that PLE outperforms state-of-the-art MTL models significantly under different task correlations and task-group size. Furthermore, online evaluation of PLE on a large-scale content recommendation platform at Tencent manifests 2.23% increase in view-count and 1.84% increase in watch time compared to SOTA MTL models, which is a significant improvement and demonstrates the effectiveness of PLE. Finally, extensive offline experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that PLE can be applied to a variety of scenarios besides recommendations to eliminate the seesaw phenomenon. PLE now has been deployed to the online video recommender system in Tencent successfully.</p>

    <h3>Interactive Recommendation via Deep Neural Memory Augmented Contextual Bandits (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Deng, Avik Ray, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin</p>
    <p>Personalized recommendation with user interactions has become increasingly popular nowadays in many applications with dynamic change of contents (news, media, etc.). Existing approaches model user interactive recommendation as a contextual bandit problem to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. However, these solutions require a large number of interactions with each user to provide high quality personalized recommendations. To mitigate this limitation, we design a novel deep neural memory augmented mechanism to model and track the history state for each user based on his previous interactions. As such, the user’s preferences on new items can be quickly learned within a small number of interactions. Moreover, we develop new algorithms to leverage large amount of all users’ history data for offline model training and online model fine tuning for each user with the focus of policy evaluation. Extensive experiments on different synthetic and real-world datasets validate that our proposed approach consistently outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art approaches.</p>
