    <h3>Evaluating The Effects of Calibrated Popularity Bias Mitigation: A Field Study (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Astrid Tessem, Anastasiia Klimashevskaia, Dietmar Jannach, Lars Skjærven, Christoph Trattner, Mehdi Elahi</p>
    <p>Despite their proven various benefits, Recommender Systems can cause or amplify certain undesired effects. In this paper, we focus on Popularity Bias, i.e., the tendency of a recommender system to utilize the effect of recommending popular items to the user. Prior research has studied the negative impact of this type of bias on individuals and society as a whole and proposed various approaches to mitigate this in various domains. However, almost all works adopted offline methodologies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Unfortunately, such offline simulations can potentially be rather simplified and unable to capture the full picture. To contribute to this line of research and given a particular lack of knowledge about how debiasing approaches work not only offline, but online as well, we present in this paper the results of user study on a national broadcaster movie streaming platform in [country]1, i.e., [platform], following the A/B testing methodology. We deployed an effective mitigation approach for popularity bias, called Calibrated Popularity (CP), and monitored its performance in comparison to the platform’s existing collaborative filtering recommendation approach as a baseline over a period of almost four months. The results obtained from a large user base interacting in real-time with the recommendations indicate that the evaluated debiasing approach can be effective in addressing popularity bias while still maintaining the level of user interest and engagement</p>

    <h3>Large-scale Interactive Conversational Recommendation System (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Allan, Ali Montazeralghaem, Philip S. Thomas</p>
    <p>We propose AC-CRS, a novel conversational recommendation system based on reinforcement learning that better models user interaction compared to prior work. Interactive recommender systems expect an initial request from a user and then iterate by asking questions or recommending potential matching items, continuing until some stopping criterion is achieved. Unlike most existing works that stop as soon as an item is recommended, we model the more realistic expectation that the interaction will continue if the item is not appropriate. Using this process, AC-CRS is able to support a more flexible conversation with users. Unlike existing models, AC-CRS is able to estimate a value for each question in the conversation to make sure that questions asked by the agent are relevant to the target item (i.e., user needs). We also model the possibility that the system could suggest more than one item in a given turn, allowing it to take advantage of screen space if it is present. AC-CRS also better accommodates the massive space of items that a real-world recommender system must handle. Experiments on real-world user purchasing data show the effectiveness of our model in terms of standard evaluation measures such as NDCG.</p>

    <h3>Recommending Personalised News in Short User Sessions (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sahin Albayrak, Rebecca Deneckere, Jon Espen Ingvaldsen, Camille Salinesi, Benjamin Kille, Elena Viorica Epure</p>
    <p>News organizations employ personalized recommenders to target news articles to specific readers and thus foster engagement. Existing approaches rely on extensive user profiles. However, though often available, authentication is a rare choice of readers consulting news publishers’ websites. This paper proposes an approach for such cases. It provides a basic degree of personalization while complying with the key characteristics of news recommendation including news popularity, recency and the dynamics of reading behavior. We extent existing research on the dynamics of news reading behavior by focusing not only on the progress of reading interests over time but also on their relations. Reading interests are considered in three categories: short, medium and long-term. Combinations of these are evaluated in terms of added value to the recommendation’s performance and ensured news variety. The experiments with 17-month data logs from a German news publisher show that most frequent relations between news reading interests are constant in time but their probabilities change. Also, recommendations based on short-term with long-term interests result in increased accuracy while recommendations based on short-term with medium-term interests yield a higher news variety.</p>
