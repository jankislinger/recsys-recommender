    <h3>Discerning Canonical User Representation for Cross-Domain Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sherry Sahebi, Siqian Zhao</p>
    <p>Cross-domain recommender systems have emerged, to address the cold-start problem and enhance recommendation outcomes by leveraging information transfer across different domains. Existing cross-domain recommender systems have investigated the learning of both domain-specific and domain-shared user preferences to enhance recommendation performance. However, these models typically allow the disparities between shared and distinct user preferences to emerge freely in any space, lacking sufficient constraints to identify differences between two domains and ensure that both domains are considered simultaneously. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) has shown promise for transferring information between domains, by mapping their user representations into the same space. But, CCA only models domain similarities, and fails to capture the potential differences between user preferences in different domains. In this paper, we propose Discerning Canonical User Representation Learning for Cross-Domain Recommendation (DICUCDR), a generative adversarial networks (GAN) based method that learns both domain-shared and domain-specific user representations. DICUCDR introduces Discerning Canonical Correlation User Representation Learning (DCCRL), a novel design of non-linear Canonical Correlation mappings that creates a shared transformation for simultaneously mapping similarities between different domains and separating domain differences from domains. We compare DICUCDR against several state-of-the-art approaches using two real-world datasets. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of separately learning shared and specific user representations via DCCRL.</p>

    <h3>Multi Cross Domain Recommendation Using Item Embedding And Canonical Correlation Analysis (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Kazama, Istvan Varga</p>
    <p>In a multi-service environment it is crucial to be able to leverage user behavior from one or more domains to create personalized recommendations in the other domain. In our paper, we present a robust transfer learning approach that successfully captures user behavior across multiple domains. First, we vectorize users and items in each domain independently. Second, using a handful of common users across domain pairs, we project each domain vector space into a common vector space using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Next, recommendations can be performed by recommending the items in any domains that are closest to the userâ€™s vector in the common space. We also experimented on what kind of domain combination works well.</p>

    <h3>It Takes Two to Tango: an Exploration of Domain Pairs for Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaghayegh Sahebi, Peter Brusilovsky</p>
    <p>As the heterogeneity of data sources are increasing on the web, and due to the sparsity of data in each of these data sources, cross-domain recommendation is becoming an emerging research topic in the recent years. Cross-domain collaborative filtering aims to transfer the user rating pattern from source (auxiliary) domains to a target domain for the purpose of alleviating the sparsity problem and providing better target recommendations. However, the studies so far have either focused on a limited number of domains that are assumed to be related to each other (such as books and movies), or a division of the same dataset (such as movies) into different domains based on an item characteristic (such as genre). In this paper, we study a broad set of domains and their characteristics to understand the factors that affect the success or failure of cross-domain collaborative filtering, the amount of improvement in cross-domain approaches, and the selection of best source domains for a specific target domain. We propose to use Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) as a significant major factor in finding the most promising source domains for a target domain, and suggest a cross-domain collaborative filtering based on CCA (CD-CCA) that proves to be successful in using the shared information between domains in the target recommendations.</p>
