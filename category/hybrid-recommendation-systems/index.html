    <h3>Boosting Local Recommendations With Partially Trained Global Model (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kexin Xie</p>
    <p>Building recommendation systems for enterprise software has many unique challenges that are different from consumer-facing systems. When applied to different organizations, the data used to power those recommendation systems vary substantially in both quality and quantity due to differences in their operational practices, marketing strategies, and targeted audiences. At Salesforce, as a cloud provider of such a system with data across many different organizations, naturally, it makes sense to pool data from different organizations to build a model that combines all values from different brands. However, multiple issues like how do we make sure a model trained with pooled data can still capture customer specific characteristics, how do we design the system to handle those data responsibly and ethically, i.e., respecting contractual agreements with our clients, legal and compliance requirements, and the privacy of all the consumers. In this proposal, We present a framework that not only utilizes enriched user-level data across organizations, but also boosts business-specific characteristics in generating personal recommendations. We will also walk through key privacy considerations when designing such a system.</p>

    <h3>HybridSVD: When Collaborative Information is Not Enough (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Oseledets, Evgeny Frolov</p>
    <p>We propose a new hybrid algorithm that allows incorporating both user and item side information within the standard collaborative filtering technique. One of its key features is that it naturally extends a simple PureSVD approach and inherits its unique advantages, such as highly efficient Lanczos-based optimization procedure, simplified hyper-parameter tuning and a quick folding-in computation for generating recommendations instantly even in highly dynamic online environments. The algorithm utilizes a generalized formulation of the singular value decomposition, which adds flexibility to the solution and allows imposing the desired structure on its latent space. Conveniently, the resulting model also admits an efficient and straightforward solution for the cold start scenario. We evaluate our approach on a diverse set of datasets and show its superiority over similar classes of hybrid models. ,</p>
