    <h3>Exploring the Semantic Gap for Movie Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehdi Elahi, Stefano Cereda, Paolo Cremonesi, Yashar Deldjoo, Farshad Bakhshandegan, Leonardo Cella</p>
    <p>In the last years, we have seen much attention given to the semantic gap problem in multimedia recommender systems. Much effort has been devoted to bridge this gap by building tools for the extraction of high-level, semantics-based features from multimedia content, as low-level features are not considered useful because they deal primarily with representing the perceived content rather than the semantics of it. In this paper, we explore a different point of view, by leveraging the gap between low-level and high-level features. We experiment with a recent approach for movie recommendations that extract low-level mise-en-scene features from multimedia content and combine it with high-level features provided by the wisdom of the crowd. For our purposes, we first designed an empirical study involving 100 subjects and implemented a movie recommender system with three different versions of the same algorithm, respectively based on (i) conventional movie attributes, (ii) mise-en-scene features, and (iii) a combination of mise-en-scene features and movie attributes. We collected data regarding the quality perceived by the users. In another study, we compared users’ perceived utility of recommendation with offline quality measures. Results from both studies show that the introduction of mise-en-scene features in conjunction with traditional attributes improves both offline and online quality of recommendations.</p>
