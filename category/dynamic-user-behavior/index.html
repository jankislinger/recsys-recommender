    <h3>RecGAN: Recurrent Generative Adversarial Networks for Recommendation Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Homin Park, Homanga Bharadhwaj, Brian Y. Lim</p>
    <p>Recent studies in recommendation systems emphasize the significance of modeling latent features behind temporal evolution of user preference and item state to make relevant suggestions. However, static and dynamic behaviors and trends of users and items, which highly influence the feasibility of recommendations, were not adequately addressed in previous works. In this work, we leverage the temporal and latent feature modelling capabilities of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), respectively, to propose a Recurrent Generative Adversarial Network (RecGAN). We use customized Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells to capture latent features of users and items observable from short-term and long-term temporal profiles. The modification also includes collaborative filtering mechanisms to improve the relevance of recommended items. To evaluated RecGAN using two datasets on food and movie recommendation. Results indicate that our model outperforms other baseline models irrespective of user behavior and density of training data.</p>

    <h3>‘I like to explore sometimes’: Adapting to Dynamic User Novelty Preferences (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vikas Kumar, Joseph A. Konstan, Loren Terveen, Paul Schrater, Komal Kapoor</p>
    <p>Studies have shown that the recommendation of unseen, novel or serendipitous items is crucial for a satisfying and engaging user experience. As a result, recent developments in recommendation research have increasingly focused towards introducing novelty in user recommendation lists. While, existing solutions aim to ﬁnd the right balance between the similarity and novelty of the recommended items, they largely ignore the user needs for novelty. In this paper, we show that there are large individual and temporal differences in the users’ novelty preferences. We develop a regression model to predict these dynamic novelty preferences of users using features derived from their past interactions. Finally, we describe an adaptive recommender, , that adapts to the user needs for novel items and show that the model achieves better recommendation performance on a metric that considers both novel and familiar items.</p>
