    <h3>Online Evaluation Methods for the Causal Effect of Recommendations (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Sato</p>
    <p>Evaluating the causal effect of recommendations is an important objective because the causal effect on user interactions can directly leads to an increase in sales and user engagement. To select an optimal recommendation model, it is common to conduct A/B testing to compare model performance. However, A/B testing of causal effects requires a large number of users, making such experiments costly and risky. We therefore propose the first interleaving methods that can efficiently compare recommendation models in terms of causal effects. In contrast to conventional interleaving methods, we measure the outcomes of both items on an interleaved list and items not on the interleaved list, since the causal effect is the difference between outcomes with and without recommendations. To ensure that the evaluations are unbiased, we either select items with equal probability or weight the outcomes using inverse propensity scores. We then verify the unbiasedness and efficiency of online evaluation methods through simulated online experiments. The results indicate that our proposed methods are unbiased and that they have superior efficiency to A/B testing.</p>

    <h3>Contextual User Browsing Bandits for Large-Scale Online Mobile Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xu He, Haikai Chen, Bo An, Qingyu Guo, Yanghua Li, Zhirong Wang, Xin Li</p>
    <p>Online recommendation services recommend multiple commodities to users. Nowadays, a considerable proportion of users visit e-commerce platforms by mobile devices. Due to the limited screen size of mobile devices, positions of items have a significant influence on clicks: 1) Higher positions lead to more clicks for one commodity. 2) The ‘pseudo-exposure’ issue: Only a few recommended items are shown at first glance and users need to slide the screen to browse other items. Therefore, some recommended items ranked behind are not viewed by users and it is not proper to treat this kind of items as negative samples. While many works model the online recommendation as contextual bandit problems, they rarely take the influence of positions into consideration and thus the estimation of the reward function may be biased. In this paper, we aim at addressing these two issues to improve the performance of online mobile recommendation. Our contributions are four-fold. First, since we concern the reward of a set of recommended items, we model the online recommendation as a contextual combinatorial bandit problem and define the reward of a recommended set. Second, we propose a novel contextual combinatorial bandit method called UBM-LinUCB to address two issues related to positions by adopting the User Browsing Model (UBM), a click model for web search. Third, we provide a formal regret analysis and prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret independent of the number of items. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on two real-world datasets by a novel unbiased estimator. An online experiment is also implemented in Taobao, one of the most popular e-commerce platforms in the world. Results on two CTR metrics show that our algorithm outperforms the other contextual bandit algorithms.</p>

    <h3>Unbiased Learning for the Causal Effect of Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janmajay Singh, Masahiro Sato, Tomoko Ohkuma, Sho Takemori</p>
    <p>Increasing users’ positive interactions, such as purchases or clicks, is an important objective of recommender systems. Recommenders typically aim to select items that users will interact with. If the recommended items are purchased, an increase in sales is expected. However, the items could have been purchased even without recommendation. Thus, we want to recommend items that results in purchases caused by recommendation. This can be formulated as a ranking problem in terms of the causal effect. Despite its importance, this problem has not been well explored in the related research. It is challenging because the ground truth of causal effect is unobservable, and estimating the causal effect is prone to the bias arising from currently deployed recommenders. This paper proposes an unbiased learning framework for the causal effect of recommendation. Based on the inverse propensity scoring technique, the proposed framework first constructs unbiased estimators for ranking metrics. Then, it conducts empirical risk minimization on the estimators with propensity capping, which reduces variance under finite training samples. Based on the framework, we develop an unbiased learning method for the causal effect extension of a ranking metric. We theoretically analyze the unbiasedness of the proposed method and empirically demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other biased learning methods in various settings.</p>
