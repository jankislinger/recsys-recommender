    <h3>Towards Sustainability-aware Recommender Systems: Analyzing the Trade-off Between Algorithms Performance and Carbon Footprint (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Semeraro, Giuseppe Spillo, Allegra De Filippo, Cataldo Musto, Michela Milano</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of the trade-off between the performance of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and their sustainability. In particular, we compared 18 popular recommendation algorithms in terms of both standard metrics (i.e., accuracy and diversity of the recommendations) as well as in terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint on three different datasets. In order to obtain a fair comparison, all the algorithms were run based on the implementations available in a popular recommendation library, i.e., RecBole, and used the same experimental settings. The outcomes of the experiments clearly showed that the choice of the optimal recommendation algorithm requires a thorough analysis, since more sophisticated algorithms often led to tiny improvements at the cost of an exponential increase of carbon emissions. Through this paper, we aim to shed light on the problem of carbon footprint and energy consumption of recommender systems, and we make the first step towards the development of sustainability-aware recommendation algorithms.</p>

    <h3>Reducing Energy Waste in Households Through Real-Time Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iraklis Varlamis, Akshay Anil Pagar, Janhavi Dahihande, Ajinkya Thakare, Magdalini Eirinaki, Akshay Anil Jaiswal</p>
    <p>The energy consumption of households has steadily increased over the last couple of decades. Research suggests that user behavior is the most influential factor in the energy waste of a household. Thus, there’s a need for helping consumers change their behavior to make it more energy efficient and environment friendly. In this work we propose a real-time recommender system that assists consumers in improving their household’s energy usage. By monitoring the power demand of each appliance in the household, the system detects the device status (on/off) at any moment, and using pattern mining creates a household profile comprising energy consumption patterns for different periods of the day. An intuitive UI allows users to set energy consumption goals and preferences on the appliances they’d like to save energy from. Based on the household profile, the user’s preferences and the actual power demand the system generates personalized real-time recommendations on which appliances should be turned off at a moment. We employ the UK-DALE (UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity) dataset to model and evaluate the entire process, from data preprocessing and transformation of the appliance power demand input to various pattern mining algorithms used to generate appliance usage profiles and recommendations, showing that even small changes in appliance usage behavior can lead to energy savings between 2-17%.</p>
