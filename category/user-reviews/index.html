    <h3>TAFA: Two-headed Attention Fused Autoencoder for Context-Aware Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin Peng Zhou, Felipe Perez, Maksims Volkovs, Zhaoyue Cheng</p>
    <p>Collaborative filtering with implicit feedback is a ubiquitous class of recommendation problems where only positive interactions such as purchases or clicks are observed. Autoencoder-based recommendation models have shown strong performance on many implicit feedback benchmarks. However, these models tend to suffer from popularity bias making recommendations less personalized. User-generated reviews contain a rich source of preference information, often with specific details that are important to each user, and can help mitigate the popularity bias. Since not all reviews are equally useful, existing work has been exploring various forms of attention to distill relevant information. In the majority of proposed approaches, representations from implicit feedback and review branches are simply concatenated at the end to generate predictions. This can prevent the model from learning deeper correlations between the two modalities and affect prediction accuracy. To address these problems, we propose a novel Two-headed Attention Fused Autoencoder (TAFA) model that jointly learns representations from user reviews and implicit feedback to make recommendations. We apply early and late modality fusion which allows the model to fully correlate and extract relevant information from both input sources. To further combat popularity bias, we leverage the Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) objective to “de-popularize” the fused user representation via a two-headed decoder architecture. Empirically, we show that TAFA outperforms leading baselines on multiple real-world benchmarks. Moreover, by tracing attention weights back to reviews we can provide explanations for the generated recommendations and gain further insights into user preferences. Full code for this work is available here: https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/TAFA.</p>

    <h3>A Ranking Optimization Approach to Latent Linear Critiquing in Conversational Recommender System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Scott Sanner, Kai Luo, Ga Wu, Hanze Li</p>
    <p>Critiquing is a method for conversational recommendation that incrementally adapts recommendations in response to user preference feedback. Specifically, a user is iteratively provided with item recommendations and attribute descriptions for those items; the user may then either accept the recommendation or choose to critique an attribute to generate a new recommendation. A recent direction known as latent linear critiquing (LLC) takes a modern embedding-based approach that seeks to optimize the combination of user preference embeddings with embeddings of critiques based on subjective item descriptions (i.e., keyphrases from user reviews); LLC does so by exploiting the linear structure of the embeddings to efficiently optimize their weights in a linear programming (LP) formulation. In this paper, we revisit LLC and note that it’s score-based optimization approach inherently encourages extreme weightings in order to maximize predicted score gaps between preferred and non-preferred items. Noting that the overall end task objective in critiquing is to re-rank rather than re-score, in this paper we take a ranking optimization approach that seeks to optimize embedding weights based on observed rank violations from earlier critiquing iterations. We evaluate the proposed framework on two recommendation datasets containing user reviews. Empirical results demonstrate that ranking-based LLC generally outperforms scoring-based LLC and other baselines across a variety of datasets, critiquing styles, and both satisfaction and session-length performance metrics.</p>

    <h3>Dish Discovery via Word Embeddings on Restaurant Reviews (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Fan Chu, Yi Ho, Ming-Feng Tsai, Chuan-Ju Wang, Chih-Yu Chao</p>
    <p>This paper proposes a novel framework for automatic dish discovery via word embeddings on restaurant reviews. We collect a dataset of user reviews from Yelp and parse the reviews to extract dish words. Then, we utilize the processed reviews as training texts to learn the embedding vectors of words via the skip-gram model. In the paper, a nearest- neighbor like score function is proposed to rank the dishes based on their learned representations. We brief some analyses on the preliminary experiments and present a web-based visualization at http://clip.csie.org/yelp/.</p>
