    <h3>Fairness Matters: A look at LLM-generated group recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonela Tommasel</p>
    <p>Recommender systems play a crucial role in how users consume information, with group recommendation receiving considerable attention. Ensuring fairness in group recommender systems entails providing recommendations that are useful and relevant to all group members rather than solely reflecting the majority’s preferences, while also addressing fairness concerns related to sensitive attributes (e.g., gender). Recently, the advancements on Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of new kinds of recommender systems. However, LLMs can perpetuate social biases present in training data, posing risks of unfair outcomes and harmful impacts. We investigated LLMs impact on group recommendation fairness, establishing and instantiating a framework that encompasses group definition, sensitive attribute combinations, and evaluation methodology. Our findings revealed the interactions patterns between sensitive attributes and LLMs and how they affected recommendation. This study advances the understanding of fairness considerations in group recommendation systems, laying the groundwork for future research.</p>

    <h3>Leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search for Group Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Andres Diaz-Pace, Antonela Tommasel</p>
    <p>Group recommenders aim to provide recommendations that satisfy the collective preferences of multiple users, a challenging task due to the diverse individual tastes and conflicting interests to be balanced. This is often accomplished by using aggregation techniques that select items on which the group can agree. Traditional aggregators struggle with these complexities, as items are chosen independently, leading to sub-optimal recommendations lacking diversity, novelty, or fairness. In this paper, we propose an aggregation technique that leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance group recommendations. MCTS is used to explore and evaluate candidate recommendation sequences to optimize overall group satisfaction. We also investigate the integration of MCTS with LLMs aiming at better understanding interactions between user preferences and recommendation sequences to inform the search. Experimental evaluations, although preliminary, showed that our proposal outperforms existing aggregation techniques in terms of relevance and beyond-accuracy aspects of recommendations. The LLM integration achieved positive results for recommendations’ relevance. Overall, this work highlights the potential of heuristic search techniques to tackle the complexities of group recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Improving Group Recommendations using Personality, Dynamic Clustering and Multi-Agent MicroServices (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> André Martins, Goreti Marreiros, Patrícia Alves, Paulo Novais</p>
    <p>The complexity associated to group recommendations needs strategies to mitigate several problems, such as the group’s heterogeinity and conflicting preferences, the emotional contagion phenomenon, the cold-start problem, and the group members’ needs and concerns while providing recommendations that satisfy all members at once. In this demonstration, we show how we implemented a Multi-Agent Microservice to represent the tourists in a mobile Group Recommender System for Tourism prototype. A novel dynamic clustering process is presented to help minimize the group’s heterogeneity and conflicting preferences. To help solve the cold-start problem, the preliminary tourist attractions preference and travel-related preferences & concerns are predicted using the tourists’ personality, while taking the tourists’ disabilities and fears into account. Although there is no need for previous interactions data to build the tourists’ profile since we predict the tourists’ preferences, the tourist agents learn with each other by using association rules to find patterns in the tourists’ profile and in the ratings given to Points of Interest to refine the recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Ensuring Fairness in Group Recommendations by Rank-Sensitive Balancing of Relevance (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Derek Bridge, Mesut Kaya, Nava Tintarev</p>
    <p>For group recommendations, one objective is to recommend an ordered set of items, a top-N, to a group such that each individual recommendation is relevant for everyone. A common way to do this is to select items on which the group can agree, using so-called ‘aggregation strategies’. One weakness of these aggregation strategies is that they select items independently of each other. They therefore cannot guarantee properties such as fairness, that apply to the set of recommendations as a whole.<br>In this paper, we give a definition of fairness that ‘balances’ the relevance of the recommended items across the group members in a rank-sensitive way. Informally, an ordered set of recommended items is considered fair to a group if the relevance of the items in the top-N is balanced across the group members for each prefix of the top-N. In other words, the first item in the top-N should, as far as possible, balance the interests of all group members; the first two items taken together must do the same; also the first three; and so on up to N. In this paper, we formalize this notion of rank-sensitive balance and provide a greedy algorithm (GFAR) for finding a top-N set of group recommendations that satisfies our definition.<br>We compare the performance of GFAR to five approaches from the literature on two datasets, one from each of the movie and music domains. We evaluate performance for 42 different configurations (two datasets, seven different group sizes, three different group types) and for ten evaluation metrics. We find that GFAR performs significantly better than all other algorithms around 43% of the time; in only 10% of cases are there algorithms that are significantly better than GFAR. Furthermore, GFAR performs particularly well in the most difficult cases, where groups are large and interests within the group diverge. We attribute GFAR’s success both to its rank-sensitivity and its way of balancing relevance. Current methods do not define fairness in a rank-sensitive way (although some achieve a degree of rank-sensitivity through the use of greedy algorithms) and none define balance in the way that we do.</p>

    <h3>User-Centered Evaluation of Strategies for Recommending Sequences of Points of Interest to Groups (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wolfgang Wörndl, Daniel Herzog</p>
    <p>Most recommender systems (RSs) predict the preferences of individual users; however, in certain scenarios, recommendations need to be made for a group of users. Tourism is a popular domain for group recommendations because people often travel in groups and look for point of interest (POI) sequences for their visits during a trip. In this study, we present different strategies that can be used to recommend POI sequences for groups. In addition, we introduce novel approaches, including a strategy called Split Group, which allows groups to split into smaller groups during a trip. We compared all strategies in a user study with 40 real groups. Our results proved that there was a significant difference in the quality of recommendations generated by using the different strategies. Most groups were willing to split temporarily during a trip, even when they were traveling with persons close to them. In this case, Split Group generated the best recommendations for different evaluation criteria. We use these findings to propose improvements for group recommendation strategies in the tourism domain.</p>

    <h3>TourRec — A Tourist Trip Recommender System for Individuals and Groups (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Laß, Daniel Herzog, Wolfgang Wörndl</p>
    <p>In this demo paper, we present TourRec, amobile Recommender System (RS) for tourist trips, sequences of points of interest (POIs) along enjoyable routes. The core of TourRec is a modular, multi-tier architecture facilitating the development and evaluation of new recommendation algorithms, clients and data sources. We show how the TourRec Android application can be used to recommend tourist trips to individuals and groups. Furthermore, we explain how TourRec supports the evaluation of different recommendation algorithms and group recommendation strategies.

    <h3>Observing Group Decision Making Processes (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laurens Rook, Markus Zanker, Hannes Werthner, Julia Neidhardt, Francesco Ricci, Amra Delic, Thuy Ngoc Nguyen</p>
    <p>Most research on group recommender systems relies on the assumption that individuals have conflicting preferences; in order to generate group recommendations the system should identify a fair way of aggregating these preferences. Both empirical studies and theoretical frameworks have tried to identify the most effective preference aggregation techniques without coming to definite conclusions. In this paper, we propose to approach group recommendation from the group dynamics perspective and analyze the group decision making process for a particular task (in the travel domain). We observe several individual and group properties and correlate them to choice satisfaction. Supported by these initial results we therefore advocate for the development of new group recommendation techniques that consider group dynamics and support the full group decision making process.</p>

    <h3>A Package Recommendation Framework for Trip Planning Activities (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominique Lenne, Idir Benouaret</p>
    <p>Classical recommender systems provide users with ranked lists of recommendations, where each one consists of a single item. However, these ranked lists are not suitable for applications such as trip planning, which deal with heterogeneous items. In this paper, we focus on the problem of recommending a set of packages to the user, where each package is constituted with a set of different Points of Interest that may constitute a tour. Given a collection of POIs, our goal is to recommend the most interesting packages for the user, where each package satisfies the budget constraints. We formally define the problem and we present a novel composite recommendation system, inspired from composite retrieval. Experimental evaluation of our proposed system, using a real-world dataset demonstrates its quality and its ability to improve both diversity and relevance of recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Preference-oriented Social Networks: Group Recommendation and Inference (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Craig Boutilier, Amirali Salehi-Abari</p>
    <p>Social networks facilitate a variety of social, economic, and political interactions. Homophily and social influence suggest that preferences (e.g., over products, services, political parties) are likely to be correlated among people whom directly interact in a social network. We develop a model, , that captures such correlations of individual preferences, where preferences take the form of rankings over a set of options. We develop probabilistic inference methods for predicting individual preferences given observed social connections and partial observations of the preferences of others in the network. We exploit these predictions in a context to make group decisions or recommendations even when the preferences of some group members are unobserved. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms and the improvements made possible by accounting for social ties.</p>

    <h3>Preference Elicitation for Narrowing the Recommended List for Groups (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lihi Naamani-Dery, Meir Kalech, Bracha Shapira, Lior Rokach</p>
    <p>A group may appreciate recommendations on items that fit their joint preferences. When the members’ actual preferences are unknown, a recommendation can be made with the aid of collaborative filtering methods. We offer to narrow down the recommended list of items by eliciting the users’ actual preferences. Our final goal is to output top-k preferred items to the group out of the top-N recommendations provided by the recommender system (k < N), where one of the items is a necessary winner. We propose an iterative preference elicitation method, where users are required to provide item ratings per request. We suggest a heuristic that attempts to minimize the preference elicitation effort under two aggregation strategies. We evaluate our methods on real-world Netflix data as well as on simulated data which allows us to study different cases. We show that preference elicitation effort can be cut in up to 90% while preserving the most preferred items in the narrowed list.</p>
