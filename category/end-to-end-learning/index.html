    <h3>Rethinking Personalized Ranking at Pinterest: An End-to-End Approach (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiajing Xu</p>
    <p>In this work, we present our journey to revolutionize the personalized recommendation engine through end-to-end learning from raw user actions. We encode user’s long-term interest in PinnerFormer, a user embedding optimized for long-term future actions via a new dense all-action loss, and capture user’s short-term intention by directly learning from the real-time action sequences. We conducted both offline and online experiments to validate the performance of the new model architecture, and also address the challenge of serving such a complex model using mixed CPU/GPU setup in production. The proposed system has been deployed in production at Pinterest and has delivered significant online gains across organic and Ads applications.</p>

    <h3>Generation-based vs. Retrieval-based Conversational Recommendation: A User-Centric Comparison (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Ahtsham Manzoor</p>
    <p>In the past few years we observed a renewed interest in conversational recommender systems (CRS) that interact with users in natural language. Most recent research efforts use neural models trained on recorded recommendation dialogs between humans, supporting an end-to-end learning process. Given the user’s utterances in a dialog, these systems aim to generate appropriate responses in natural language based on the learned models. An alternative to such language generation approaches is to retrieve and possibly adapt suitable sentences from the recorded dialogs. Approaches of this latter type are explored only to a lesser extent in the current literature.<br>In this work, we revisit the potential value of retrieval-based approaches to conversational recommendation. To that purpose, we compare two recent deep learning models for response generation with a retrieval-based method that determines a set of response candidates using a nearest-neighbor technique and heuristically reranks them. We adopt a user-centric evaluation approach, where study participants (N=60) rated the responses of the three compared systems. We could reproduce the claimed improvement of one of the deep learning methods over the other. However, the retrieval-based system outperformed both language generation based approaches in terms of the perceived quality of the system responses. Overall, our study suggests that retrieval-based approaches should be considered as an alternative or complement to modern language generation-based approaches.</p>

    <h3>KRED: Knowledge-Aware Document Representation for News Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing Xie, Ying Qiao, Shiyin Wang, Guangzhong Sun, Jianxun Lian, Danyang Liu, Jiun-Hung Chen</p>
    <p>News articles usually contain knowledge entities such as celebrities or organizations. Important entities in articles carry key messages and help to understand the content in a more direct way. An industrial news recommender system contains various key applications, such as personalized recommendation, item-to-item recommendation, news category classification, news popularity prediction and local news detection. We find that incorporating knowledge entities for better document understanding benefits these applications consistently. However, existing document understanding models either represent news articles without considering knowledge entities (e.g., BERT) or rely on a specific type of text encoding model (e.g., DKN) so that the generalization ability and efficiency is compromised. In this paper, we propose KRED, which is a fast and effective model to enhance arbitrary document representation with a knowledge graph. KRED first enriches entities’ embeddings by attentively aggregating information from their neighborhood in the knowledge graph. Then a context embedding layer is applied to annotate the dynamic context of different entities such as frequency, category and position. Finally, an information distillation layer aggregates the entity embeddings under the guidance of the original document representation and transforms the document vector into a new one. We advocate to optimize the model with a multi-task framework, so that different news recommendation applications can be united and useful information can be shared across different tasks. Experiments on a real-world Microsoft News dataset demonstrate that KRED greatly benefits a variety of news recommendation applications.</p>
