    <h3>Nonlinear Bandits Exploration for Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minmin Chen, Yi Su</p>
    <p>The paradigm of framing recommendations as (sequential) decision-making processes has gained significant interest. To achieve long-term user satisfaction, these interactive systems need to strikes a balance between exploitation (recommending high-reward items) and exploration (exploring uncertain regions for potentially better items). Classical bandit algorithms like Upper-Confidence-Bound and Thompson Sampling, and their contextual extensions with linear payoffs have exhibited strong theoretical guarantees and empirical success in managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Building efficient exploration-based systems for deep neural network powered real-world, large-scale industrial recommender systems remains under studied. In addition, these systems are often multi-stage, multi-objective and response time sensitive.  In this talk, we share our experience in addressing these challenges in building exploration based industrial recommender systems. Specifically, we adopt the Neural Linear Bandit algorithm, which effectively combines the representation power of deep neural networks, with the simplicity of linear bandits to incorporate exploration in DNN based recommender systems. We introduce  exploration capability to both the nomination and ranking stage of the industrial recommender system.  In the context of the ranking stage, we delve into the extension of this algorithm to accommodate the multi-task setup, enabling exploration in systems with multiple objectives. Moving on to the nomination stage, we will address the development of efficient bandit algorithms tailored to factorized bi-linear models. These algorithms play a crucial role in facilitating maximum inner product search, which is commonly employed in large-scale retrieval systems. We validate our algorithms and present findings from real-world live experiments.</p>

    <h3>Understanding User Interactions with Podcast Recommendations Delivered Via Voice (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longqi Yang, Christina Tsangouri, Deborah Estrin, Michael Sobolev</p>
    <p>Voice interfaces introduced by smart speakers present new opportunities and challenges for podcast content recommendations. Understanding how users interact with voice-based recommendations has the potential to inform better design of vocal recommenders. However, existing knowledge about user behavior is mostly for visual interfaces, such as the web, and is not directly transferable to voice interfaces, which rely on user listening and do not support skimming and browsing. To fill in the gap, in this paper, we conduct a controlled study to compare user interactions with recommendations delivered visually and vocally. Through an online A-B testing with 100 participants, we find that, when recommendations are vocally conveyed, users consume more slowly, explore less, and choose fewer long-tail items. The study also reveals the correlation between user choices and exploration via the voice interface. Our findings provide challenges to the design of voice interfaces, such as increasing the diversity of the top-ranked recommendations and designing better navigation mechanisms.</p>

    <h3>A Recommender System for Personalized Exploration of Majors, Minors, and Concentrations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Young Park</p>
    <p>Many students change their majors during college. Choosing the right academic majors, minors, and concentrations within a major in higher education is challenging but crucial in assuring studentsâ€™ overall academic and career success. Personalized prediction of student success in majors, minors, and concentrations will help students better find the right majors, minors, and concentrations for them, so as to timely achieve their academic goals. In this paper, we present a new recommender application for the academic major/minor/concentration selection problem in the educational domain. The proposed major/minor/concentration recommender system is a collaborative filtering-based recommender based on student grade prediction, and provides a variety of personalized predictions and recommendations on majors, minors, and concentrations. It is a useful tool to guide students, advisors, and administrators during the personalized major/minor/concentration exploration (declare/change) process.</p>
