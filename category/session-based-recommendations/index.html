    <h3>Pareto Front Approximation for Multi-Objective Session-Based Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timo Wilm, Philipp Normann, Felix Stepprath</p>
    <p>This work introduces MultiTRON, an approach that adapts Pareto front approximation techniques to multi-objective session-based recommender systems using a transformer neural network. Our approach optimizes trade-offs between key metrics such as click-through and conversion rates by training on sampled preference vectors. A significant advantage is that after training, a single model can access the entire Pareto front, allowing it to be tailored to meet the specific requirements of different stakeholders by adjusting an additional input vector that weights the objectives. We validate the model’s performance through extensive offline and online evaluation. For broader application and research, the source code is made available. The results confirm the model’s ability to manage multiple recommendation objectives effectively, offering a flexible tool for diverse business needs.</p>

    <h3>SPARE: Shortest Path Global Item Relations for Efficient Session-based Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Peintner, Eva Zangerle, Amir Reza Mohammadi</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendation aims to predict the next item based on a set of anonymous sessions. Capturing user intent from a short interaction sequence imposes a variety of challenges since no user profiles are available and interaction data is naturally sparse. Recent approaches relying on graph neural networks (GNNs) for session-based recommendation use global item relations to explore collaborative information from different sessions. These methods capture the topological structure of the graph and rely on multi-hop information aggregation in GNNs to exchange information along edges. Consequently, graph-based models suffer from noisy item relations in the training data and introduce high complexity for large item catalogs. We propose to explicitly model the multi-hop information aggregation mechanism over multiple layers via shortest-path edges based on knowledge from the sequential recommendation domain. Our approach does not require multiple layers to exchange information and ignores unreliable item-item relations. Furthermore, to address inherent data sparsity, we are the first to apply supervised contrastive learning by mining data-driven positive and hard negative item samples from the training data. Extensive experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms almost all of the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>Scaling Session-Based Transformer Recommendations using Optimized Negative Sampling and Loss Functions (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Normann, Timo Wilm, Paul-Vincent Kobow, Sophie Baumeister</p>
    <p>This work introduces TRON, a scalable session-based Transformer Recommender using Optimized Negative-sampling. Motivated by the scalability and performance limitations of prevailing models such as SASRec and GRU4Rec+, TRON integrates top-k negative sampling and listwise loss functions to enhance its recommendation accuracy. Evaluations on relevant large-scale e-commerce datasets show that TRON improves upon the recommendation quality of current methods while maintaining training speeds similar to SASRec. A live A/B test yielded an 18.14% increase in click-through rate over SASRec, highlighting the potential of TRON in practical settings. For further research, we provide access to our source code and an anonymized dataset.</p>

    <h3>Learning Recommendations from User Actions in the Item-poor Insurance Domain (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Borg Bruun, Christina Lioma, Maria Maistro</p>
    <p>While personalised recommendations are successful in domains like retail, where large volumes of user feedback on items are available, the generation of automatic recommendations in data-sparse domains, like insurance purchasing, is an open problem. The insurance domain is notoriously data-sparse because the number of products is typically low (compared to retail) and they are usually purchased to last for a long time. Also, many users still prefer the telephone over the web for purchasing products, reducing the amount of web-logged user interactions. To address this, we present a recurrent neural network recommendation model that uses past user sessions as signals for learning recommendations. Learning from past user sessions allows dealing with the data scarcity of the insurance domain. Specifically, our model learns from several types of user actions that are not always associated with items, and unlike all prior session-based recommendation models, it models relationships between input sessions and a target action (purchasing insurance) that does not take place within the input sessions. Evaluation on a real-world dataset from the insurance domain (ca. 44K users, 16 items, 54K purchases, and 117K sessions) against several state-of-the-art baselines shows that our model outperforms the baselines notably. Ablation analysis shows that this is mainly due to the learning of dependencies across sessions in our model. We contribute the first ever session-based model for insurance recommendation, and make available our dataset to the research community.</p>

    <h3>M2TRec: Metadata-aware Multi-task Transformer for Large-scale and Cold-start free Session-based Recommendations (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sejoon Oh, Amir Afsharinejad, Xiquan Cui, Walid Shalaby, Srijan Kumar</p>
    <p>Session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) have shown superior performance over conventional methods. However, they show limited scalability on large-scale industrial datasets since most models learn one embedding per item. This leads to a large memory requirement (of storing one vector per item) and poor performance on sparse sessions with cold-start or unpopular items. Using one public and one large industrial dataset, we experimentally show that state-of-the-art SBRSs have low performance on sparse sessions with sparse items. We propose M2TRec, a Metadata-aware Multi-task Transformer model for session-based recommendations. Our proposed method learns a transformation function from item metadata to embeddings, and is thus, item-ID free (i.e., does not need to learn one embedding per item). It integrates item metadata to learn shared representations of diverse item attributes. During inference, new or unpopular items will be assigned identical representations for the attributes they share with items previously observed during training, and thus will have similar representations with those items, enabling recommendations of even cold-start and sparse items. Additionally, M2TRec is trained in a multi-task setting to predict the next item in the session along with its primary category and subcategories. Our multi-task strategy makes the model converge faster and significantly improves the overall performance. Experimental results show significant performance gains using our proposed approach on sparse items on the two datasets.</p>

    <h3>Streaming Session-Based Recommendation: When Graph Neural Networks meet the Neighborhood (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sara Latifi, Dietmar Jannach</p>
    <p>Frequent updates and model retraining are important in various application areas of recommender systems, e.g., news recommendation. Moreover, in such domains, we may not only face the problem of dealing with a constant stream of new data, but also with anonymous users, leading to the problem of streaming session-based recommendation (SSR). Such problem settings have attracted increased interest in recent years, and different deep learning architectures were proposed that support fast updates of the underlying prediction models when new data arrive. In a recent paper, a method based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) was proposed as being superior than previous methods for the SSR problem. The baselines in the reported experiments included different machine learning models. However, several earlier studies have shown that often conceptually simpler methods, e.g., based on nearest neighbors, can be highly effective for session-based recommendation problems. In this work, we report a similar phenomenon for the streaming configuration. We first reproduce the results of the mentioned GNN method and then show that simpler methods are able to outperform this complex state-of-the-art neural method on two datasets. Overall, our work points to continued methodological issues in the academic community, e.g., in terms of the choice of baselines and reproducibility.1</p>

    <h3>Context-aware Graph Embedding for Session-based News Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heng-Shiou Sheu, Sheng Li</p>
    <p>Online news recommender systems aim to make personalized recommendations according to user preferences, which require modeling users’ short-term reading interest. However, due to the limited logged user interactions in practice, news recommendation at session-level becomes very challenging. Existing methods on session-based news recommendation mainly focus on extracting features from news articles and sequential user-item interactions, but they usually ignore the semantic-level structural information among news articles and do not explore external knowledge sources. In this paper, we propose a novel Context-Aware Graph Embedding (CAGE) framework for session-based news recommendation, which builds an auxiliary knowledge graph to enrich the semantic meaning of entities involved in articles, and further refines the article embeddings by graph convolutional networks. Experimental results on a real-world news dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods on session-based news recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Exploring Longitudinal Effects of Session-based Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xavier Serra, Dietmar Jannach, Andres Ferraro</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendation is a problem setting where the task of a recommender system is to make suitable item suggestions based only on a few observed user interactions in an ongoing session. The lack of long-term preference information about individual users in such settings usually results in a limited level of personalization, where a small set of popular items may be recommended to many users. This repeated exposure of such a subset of the items through the recommendations may in turn lead to a reinforcement effect over time, and to a system which is not able to help users discover new content anymore to the desirable extent.<br>In this work, we investigate such potential longitudinal effects of session-based recommendations in a simulation-based approach. Specifically, we analyze to what extent algorithms of different types may lead to concentration effects over time. Our experiments in the music domain reveal that all investigated algorithms—both neural and heuristic ones—may lead to lower item coverage and to a higher concentration on a subset of the items. Additional simulation experiments however also indicate that relatively simple re-ranking strategies, e.g., by avoiding too many repeated recommendations in the music domain, may help to deal with this problem.</p>

    <h3>A Ranking Optimization Approach to Latent Linear Critiquing in Conversational Recommender System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Scott Sanner, Kai Luo, Ga Wu, Hanze Li</p>
    <p>Critiquing is a method for conversational recommendation that incrementally adapts recommendations in response to user preference feedback. Specifically, a user is iteratively provided with item recommendations and attribute descriptions for those items; the user may then either accept the recommendation or choose to critique an attribute to generate a new recommendation. A recent direction known as latent linear critiquing (LLC) takes a modern embedding-based approach that seeks to optimize the combination of user preference embeddings with embeddings of critiques based on subjective item descriptions (i.e., keyphrases from user reviews); LLC does so by exploiting the linear structure of the embeddings to efficiently optimize their weights in a linear programming (LP) formulation. In this paper, we revisit LLC and note that it’s score-based optimization approach inherently encourages extreme weightings in order to maximize predicted score gaps between preferred and non-preferred items. Noting that the overall end task objective in critiquing is to re-rank rather than re-score, in this paper we take a ranking optimization approach that seeks to optimize embedding weights based on observed rank violations from earlier critiquing iterations. We evaluate the proposed framework on two recommendation datasets containing user reviews. Empirical results demonstrate that ranking-based LLC generally outperforms scoring-based LLC and other baselines across a variety of datasets, critiquing styles, and both satisfaction and session-length performance metrics.</p>

    <h3>Contextual and Sequential User Embeddings for Large-Scale Music Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Mehrotra, Christian Hansen, Casper Hansen, Brian Brost, Federico Tomasi, Lucas Maystre, Mounia Lalmas</p>
    <p>Recommender systems play an important role in providing an engaging experience on online music streaming services. However, the musical domain presents distinctive challenges to recommender systems: tracks are short, listened to multiple times, typically consumed in sessions with other tracks, and relevance is highly context-dependent. In this paper, we argue that modeling users’ preferences at the beginning of a session is a practical and effective way to address these challenges. Using a dataset from Spotify, a popular music streaming service, we observe that a) consumption from the recent past and b) session-level contextual variables (such as the time of the day or the type of device used) are indeed predictive of the tracks a user will stream—much more so than static, average preferences. Driven by these findings, we propose CoSeRNN, a neural network architecture that models users’ preferences as a sequence of embeddings, one for each session. CoSeRNN predicts, at the beginning of a session, a preference vector, based on past consumption history and current context. This preference vector can then be used in downstream tasks to generate contextually relevant just-in-time recommendations efficiently, by using approximate nearest-neighbour search algorithms. We evaluate CoSeRNN on session and track ranking tasks, and find that it outperforms the current state of the art by upwards of 10% on different ranking metrics. Dissecting the performance of our approach, we find that sequential and contextual information are both crucial.</p>

    <h3>From the Lab to Production: A Case Study of Session-Based Recommendations in the Home-Improvement Domain (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pigi Kouki, Xiquan Cui, Khalifeh Al Jadda, Ilias Fountalis, Edo Liberty, Nikolaos Vasiloglou</p>
    <p>E-commerce applications rely heavily on session-based recommendation algorithms to improve the shopping experience of their customers. Recent progress in session-based recommendation algorithms shows great promise. However, translating that promise to real-world outcomes is a challenging task for several reasons, but mostly due to the large number and varying characteristics of the available models. In this paper, we discuss the approach and lessons learned from the process of identifying and deploying a successful session-based recommendation algorithm for a leading e-commerce application in the home-improvement domain. To this end, we initially evaluate fourteen session-based recommendation algorithms in an offline setting using eight different popular evaluation metrics on three datasets. The results indicate that offline evaluation does not provide enough insight to make an informed decision since there is no clear winning method on all metrics. Additionally, we observe that standard offline evaluation metrics fall short for this application. Specifically, they reward an algorithm only when it predicts the exact same item that the user clicked next or eventually purchased. In a practical scenario, however, there are near-identical products which, although they are assigned different identifiers, they should be considered as equally-good recommendations. To overcome these limitations, we perform an additional round of evaluation, where human experts provide both objective and subjective feedback for the recommendations of five algorithms that performed the best in the offline evaluation. We find that the experts’ opinion is oftentimes different from the offline evaluation results. Analysis of the feedback confirms that the performance of all models is significantly higher when we evaluate near-identical product recommendations as relevant. Finally, we run an A/B test with one of the models that performed the best in the human evaluation phase. The treatment model increased conversion rate by 15.6% and revenue per visit by 18.5% when compared with a leading third-party solution.</p>

    <h3>User-Centric Evaluation of Session-Based Recommendations for an Automated Radio Station (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Malte Ludewig</p>
    <p>The creation of an automated and virtually endless playlist given a start item is a common feature of modern media streaming services. When no past information about the user’s preferences is available, the creation of such playlists can be done using session-based recommendation techniques. In this case, the recommendations only depend on the start item and the user’s interactions in the current listening session, such as ‘liking’ or skipping an item. In recent years, various novel session-based techniques were proposed, often based on deep learning. The evaluation of such approaches is in most cases solely based on offline experimentation and abstract accuracy measures. However, such evaluations cannot inform us about the quality as perceived by users. To close this research gap, we have conducted a user study (N=250), where the participants interacted with an automated online radio station. Each treatment group received recommendations that were generated by one of five different algorithms. Our results show that comparably simple techniques led to quality perceptions that are similar or even better than when a complex deep learning mechanism or Spotify’s recommendations are used. The simple mechanisms, however, often tend to recommend comparably popular tracks, which can lead to lower discovery effects. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Performance Comparison of Neural and Non-Neural Approaches to Session-based Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malte Ludewig, Sara Latifi, Noemi Mauro, Dietmar Jannach</p>
    <p>The benefits of neural approaches are undisputed in many application areas. However, today’s research practice in applied machine learning‚ where researchers often use a variety of baselines, datasets, and evaluation procedures, can make it difficult to understand how much progress is actually achieved through novel technical approaches. In this work, we focus on the fast-developing area of session-based recommendation and aim to contribute to a better understanding of what represents the state-of-the-art. To that purpose, we have conducted an extensive set of experiments, using a variety of datasets, in which we benchmarked four neural approaches that were published in the last three years against each other and against a set of simpler baseline techniques, e.g., based on nearest neighbors. The evaluation of the algorithms under the exact same conditions revealed that the benefits of applying today’s neural approaches to session-based recommendations are still limited. In the majority of the cases, and in particular when precision and recall are used, it turned out that simple techniques in most cases outperform recent neural approaches. Our findings therefore point to certain major limitations of today’s research practice. By sharing our evaluation framework publicly, we hope that some of these limitations can be overcome in the future. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>StreamingRec: A Framework for Benchmarking Stream-based News Recommenders (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Michael Jugovac, Mozhgan Karimi</p>
    <p>News is one of the earliest application domains of recommender systems, and recommending items from a virtually endless stream of news is still a relevant problem today. News recommendation is different from other application domains in a variety of ways, e.g., because new items constantly become available for recommendation. To be effective, news recommenders therefore have to continuously consider the latest items in the incoming stream of news in their recommendation models. However, today’s public software libraries for algorithm benchmarking mostly do not consider these particularities of the domain. As a result, authors often rely on proprietary protocols, which hampers the comparability of the obtained results. In this paper, we present StreamingRec as a framework for evaluating streaming-based news recommenders in a replicable way. The open-source framework implements a replay-based evaluation protocol that allows algorithms to update the underlying models in real-time when new events are recorded and new articles are available for recommendation. Furthermore, a variety of baseline algorithms for session-based recommendation are part of StreamingRec. For these, we also report a number of performance results for two datasets, which confirm the importance of immediate model updates.</p>

    <h3>Learning Within-Session Budgets from Browsing Trajectories for Item Recommendations (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Louca, Julian McAuley, Liangjie Hong, Diane Hu</p>
    <p>Building price- and budget-aware recommender systems is critical in settings where one wishes to produce recommendations that balance users’ preferences (what they like) with a model of purchase likelihood (what they will buy). A trivial solution consists of learning global budget terms for each user based on their past expenditure. To more accurately model user budgets, we also consider a user’s within-session budget, which may deviate from their global budget depending on their shopping context. In this paper, we find that users implicitly reveal their session-specific budgets through the sequence of items they browse within that session. Specifically, we find that some users browse down, by purchasing the cheapest item among alternatives under consideration, others browse up(selecting the most expensive), and others ultimately purchase items around the middle. Surprisingly, this mixture of behaviors is difficult to observe globally, but individual users tend to belong firmly to one of the three segments. To model this behavior, we develop an interpretable budget model that combines a clustering component to detect different user segments, with a model of segment-specific purchase profiles. We apply our model on a production dataset of browsing and purchasing sessions from a large e-commerce website focused on handmade and vintage goods, where it outperforms strong baselines and existing production systems.</p>

    <h3>When Recurrent Neural Networks meet the Neighborhood for Session-Based Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malte Ludewig, Dietmar Jannach</p>
    <p>Deep learning methods have led to substantial progress in various application fields of AI, and in recent years a number of proposals were made to improve recommender systems with artificial neural networks. For the problem of making session-based recommendations, i.e., for recommending the next item in an anonymous session, Hidasi et al. recently investigated the application of recurrent neural networks with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU4REC). Assessing the true value of such novel approaches based only on what is reported in the literature is however difficult when no standard evaluation protocols are applied and when the strength of the baselines used in the performance comparison is not clear. In this work we show based on a comprehensive empirical evaluation that a heuristics-based nearest neighbor (kNN) scheme for sessions outperforms GRU4REC in the large majority of the tested configurations and datasets. Neighborhood sampling and efficient in-memory data structures ensure the scalability of the kNN method. The best results in the end were often achieved when we combine the kNN approach with GRU4REC, which shows that RNNs can leverage sequential signals in the data that cannot be detected by the co-occurrence-based kNN method.</p>
