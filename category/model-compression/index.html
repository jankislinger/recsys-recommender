    <h3>Bridging the Gap: Unpacking the Hidden Challenges in Knowledge Distillation for Online Ranking Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuo Yang, Yang Liu, Nikhil Khani, Li Wei, Pendo Abbo, Aniruddh Nath, Shawn Andrews</p>
    <p>Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a powerful approach for compressing large models into smaller, more efficient models, particularly beneficial for latency-sensitive applications like recommender systems. However, current KD research predominantly focuses on Computer Vision (CV) and NLP tasks, overlooking unique data characteristics and challenges inherent to recommender systems.  This paper addresses these overlooked challenges, specifically: (1) mitigating data distribution shifts between teacher and student models, (2) efficiently identifying optimal teacher configurations within time and budgetary constraints, and (3) enabling computationally efficient and rapid sharing of teacher labels to support multiple students. We present a robust KD system developed and rigorously evaluated on multiple large-scale personalized video recommendation systems within Google. Our live experiment results demonstrate significant improvements in student model performance while ensuring consistent and reliable generation of high-quality teacher labels from continuous data streams.</p>

    <h3>A Payload Optimization Method for Federated Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuan Eeik Tan, Zareen Alamgir, Muhammad Ammad-ud-din, Farwa K. Khan, Adrian Flanagan</p>
    <p>In this study, we introduce the payload optimization method for federated recommender systems (FRS). In federated learning (FL), the global model payload that is moved between the server and users depends on the number of items to recommend. The model payload grows when there is an increasing number of items. This becomes challenging for FRS if it is running in production mode. To tackle the payload challenge, we formulated a multi-arm bandit solution that selected part of the global model and transmitted it to all users. The selection process was guided by a novel reward function suitable for FL systems. So far as we are aware, this is the first optimization method that seeks to address item dependent payloads. The method was evaluated using three benchmark recommendation datasets. The empirical validation confirmed that the proposed method outperforms the simpler methods that do not benefit from the bandits for the purpose of item selection. In addition, we have demonstrated the usefulness of our proposed method by rigorously evaluating the effects of a payload reduction on the recommendation performance degradation. Our method achieved up to a 90% reduction in model payload, yielding only a âˆ¼ 4% - 8% loss in the recommendation performance for highly sparse datasets.</p>

    <h3>Model Size Reduction Using Frequency Based Double Hashing for Recommender Systems (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pranay Kumar Myana, Caojin Zhang, Alykhan Tejani, Akshay Gupta, Deepak Dilipkumar, Ferenc Huszar, Sofia Ira Ira Ktena, Ikuhiro Ihara, Prasang Upadhyaya, Wenzhe Shi, Yuanpu Xie, Suvadip Paul, Yicun Liu</p>
    <p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with sparse input features have been widely used in recommender systems in industry. These models have large memory requirements and need a huge amount of training data. The large model size usually entails a cost, in the range of millions of dollars, for storage and communication with the inference services. In this paper, we propose a hybrid hashing method to combine frequency hashing and double hashing techniques for model size reduction, without compromising performance. We evaluate the proposed models on two product surfaces. In both cases, experiment results demonstrated that we can reduce the model size by around 90 while keeping the performance on par with the original baselines.</p>
