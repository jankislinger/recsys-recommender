    <h3>Representation Learning for Homophilic Preferences (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hady W. Lauw, Trong T. Nguyen</p>
    <p>Users express their personal preferences through ratings, adoptions, and other consumption behaviors. We seek to learn latent representations for user preferences from such behavioral data. One representation learning model that has been shown to be effective for large preference datasets is Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). While homophily, or the tendency of friends to share their preferences at some level, is an established notion in sociology, thus far it has not yet been clearly demonstrated on RBM-based preference models. The question lies in how to appropriately incorporate social network into the architecture of RBM-based models for learning representations of preferences. In this paper, we propose two potential architectures: one that models social network among users as additional observations, and another that incorporates social network into the sharing of hidden units among related users. We study the efficacies of these proposed architectures on publicly available, real-life preference datasets with social networks, yielding useful insights.</p>

    <h3>Preference-oriented Social Networks: Group Recommendation and Inference (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Craig Boutilier, Amirali Salehi-Abari</p>
    <p>Social networks facilitate a variety of social, economic, and political interactions. Homophily and social influence suggest that preferences (e.g., over products, services, political parties) are likely to be correlated among people whom directly interact in a social network. We develop a model, , that captures such correlations of individual preferences, where preferences take the form of rankings over a set of options. We develop probabilistic inference methods for predicting individual preferences given observed social connections and partial observations of the preferences of others in the network. We exploit these predictions in a context to make group decisions or recommendations even when the preferences of some group members are unobserved. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms and the improvements made possible by accounting for social ties.</p>
