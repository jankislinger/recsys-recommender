    <h3>Enhancing Cross-Domain Recommender Systems with LLMs: Evaluating Bias and Beyond-Accuracy Measures (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Elmar Kolb</p>
    <p>The research domain of recommender systems is rapidly evolving. Initially, optimization efforts focused primarily on accuracy. However, recent research has highlighted the importance of addressing bias and beyond-accuracy measures such as novelty, diversity, and serendipity. With the rise of multi-domain recommender systems, the need to re-examine bias and beyond-accuracy measures in cross-domain settings has become crucial. Traditional methods face challenges such as cold-start problems, which can potentially be mitigated by leveraging LLMs. This proposed work investigates how LLM-based recommendation methods can enhance cross-domain recommender systems, focusing on identifying, measuring, and mitigating bias while evaluating the impact of beyond-accuracy measures. We aim to provide new insights by comparing traditional and LLM-based systems within a real-world environment encompassing the domains of news, books, and various lifestyle areas. Our research seeks to address the outlined gaps and develop effective evaluation strategies for the unique challenges posed by LLMs in cross-domain recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Integrating the ACT-R Framework with Collaborative Filtering for Explainable Sequential Music Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Wallmann, Markus Schedl, Elisabeth Lex, Dominik Kowald, Marta Moscati, Markus Reiter-Haas</p>
    <p>Music listening sessions often consist of sequences including repeating tracks. Modeling such relistening behavior with models of human memory has been proven effective in predicting the next track of a session. However, these models intrinsically lack the capability of recommending novel tracks that the target user has not listened to in the past. Collaborative filtering strategies, on the contrary, provide novel recommendations by leveraging past collective behaviors but are often limited in their ability to provide explanations. To narrow this gap, we propose four hybrid algorithms that integrate collaborative filtering with the cognitive architecture ACT-R. We compare their performance in terms of accuracy, novelty, diversity, and popularity bias, to baselines of different types, including pure ACT-R, kNN-based, and neural-networks-based approaches. We show that the proposed algorithms are able to achieve the best performances in terms of novelty and diversity, and simultaneously achieve a higher accuracy of recommendation with respect to pure ACT-R models. Furthermore, we illustrate how the proposed models can provide explainable recommendations.</p>

    <h3>An Industrial Framework for Personalized Serendipitous Recommendation in E-commerce (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sulong Xu, Anyu Dai, Zhuoye Ding, Linfang Hou, Mian Ma, Luobao Zou, Yanyan Zou, Zongyi Wang, Nan Qiao</p>
    <p>Classical recommendation methods typically face the filter bubble problem where users likely receive recommendations of their familiar items, making them bored and dissatisfied. To alleviate such an issue, this applied paper introduces a novel framework for personalized serendipitous recommendation in an e-commerce platform (i.e., JD.com), which allows to present user unexpected and satisfying items deviating from user’s prior behaviors, considering both accuracy and novelty. To achieve such a goal, it is crucial yet challenging to recognize when a user is willing to receive serendipitous items and how many novel items are expected. To address above two challenges, a two-stage framework is designed. Firstly, a DNN-based scorer is deployed to quantify the novelty degree of a product category based on user behavior history. Then, we resort to a potential outcome framework to decide the optimal timing to recommend a user serendipitous items and the novelty degree of the recommendation. Online A/B test on the e-commerce recommender platform in JD.com demonstrates that our model achieves significant gains on various metrics, 0.54% relative increase of impressive depth, 0.8% of average user click count, 3.23%  and 1.38% of number of novel impressive and clicked items individually.</p>

    <h3>Reproducibility of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning Recommendation: Interplay between Effectiveness and Beyond-Accuracy Perspectives (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Paparella, Ludovico Boratto, Vito Walter Anelli, Tommaso Di Noia</p>
    <p>Providing effective suggestions is of predominant importance for successful Recommender Systems (RSs). Nonetheless, the need of accounting for additional multiple objectives has become prominent, from both the final users’ and the item providers’ points of view. This need has led to a new class of RSs, called Multi-Objective Recommender Systems (MORSs). These systems are designed to provide suggestions by considering multiple (conflicting) objectives simultaneously, such as diverse, novel, and fairness-aware recommendations. In this work, we reproduce a state-of-the-art study on MORSs that exploits a reinforcement learning agent to satisfy three objectives, i.e., accuracy, diversity, and novelty of recommendations. The selected study is one of the few MORSs where the source code and datasets are released to ensure the reproducibility of the proposed approach. Interestingly, we find that some challenges arise when replicating the results of the original work, due to the nature of multiple-objective problems. We also extend the evaluation of the approach to analyze the impact of improving user-centred objectives of recommendations (i.e., diversity and novelty) in terms of algorithmic bias. To this end, we take into consideration both popularity and category of the items. We discover some interesting trends in the recommendation performance according to different evaluation metrics. In addition, we see that the multi-objective reinforcement learning approach is responsible for increasing the bias disparity in the output of the recommendation algorithm for those items belonging to positively/negatively biased categories. We publicly release datasets and codes in the following GitHub repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MORS_reproducibility-BD60</p>

    <h3>Masked and Swapped Sequence Modeling for Next Novel Basket Recommendation in Grocery Shopping (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Yates, Mozhdeh Ariannezhad, Maarten de Rijke, Ming Li</p>
    <p>Next basket recommendation (NBR) is the task of predicting the next set of items based on a sequence of already purchased baskets. It is a recommendation task that has been widely studied, especially in the context of grocery shopping. In NBR, it is useful to distinguish between repeat items, i.e., items that a user has consumed before, and explore items, i.e., items that a user has not consumed before. Most NBR work either ignores this distinction or focuses on repeat items. We formulate the next novel basket recommendation (NNBR) task, i.e., the task of recommending a basket that only consists of novel items, which is valuable for both real-world application and NBR evaluation. We evaluate how existing NBR methods perform on the NNBR task and find that, so far, limited progress has been made w.r.t. the NNBR task. To address the NNBR task, we propose a simple bi-directional transformer basket recommendation model (BTBR), which is focused on directly modeling item-to-item correlations within and across baskets instead of learning complex basket representations. To properly train BTBR, we propose and investigate several masking strategies and training objectives: (i) item-level random masking, (ii) item-level select masking, (iii) basket-level all masking, (iv) item basket-level explore masking, and (v) joint masking. In addition, an item-basket swapping strategy is proposed to enrich the item interactions within the same baskets. We conduct extensive experiments on three open datasets with various characteristics. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of BTBR and our masking and swapping strategies for the NNBR task. BTBR with a properly selected masking and swapping strategy can substantially improve the NNBR performance.</p>

    <h3>I want to break free! Recommending friends from outside the echo chamber (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniela Godoy, Antonela Tommasel, Juan Manuel Rodriguez</p>
    <p>Recommender systems serve as mediators of information consumption and propagation. In this role, these systems have been recently criticized for introducing biases and promoting the creation of echo chambers and filter bubbles, thus lowering the diversity of both content and potential new social relations users are exposed to. Some of these issues are a consequence of the fundamental concepts on which recommender systems are based on. Assumptions like the homophily principle might lead users to content that they already like or friends they already know, which can be naïve in the era of ideological uniformity and fake news. A significant challenge in this context is how to effectively learn the dynamic representations of users based on the content they share and their echo chamber or community interactions to recommend potentially relevant and diverse friends from outside the network of influence of the users’ echo chamber. To address this, we devise FRediECH (a Friend RecommenDer for breakIng Echo CHambers), an echo chamber-aware friend recommendation approach that learns users and echo chamber representations from the shared content and past users’ and communities’ interactions. Comprehensive evaluations over Twitter data showed that our approach achieved better performance (in terms of relevance and novelty) than state-of-the-art alternatives, validating its effectiveness.</p>

    <h3>Values of Exploration in Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohit Sharma, Ya Le, Yuyan Wang, Minmin Chen, Ed Chi, Can Xu, Lee Richardson</p>
    <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been sought after to bring next-generation recommender systems to further improve user experience on recommendation platforms. While the exploration-exploitation tradeoff is the foundation of RL research, the value of exploration in (RL-based) recommender systems is less well understood. Exploration, commonly seen as a tool to reduce model uncertainty in regions of sparse user interaction/feedback, is believed to cost user experience in the short term, while the indirect benefit of better model quality arrives at a later time. We focus on another aspect of exploration, which we refer to as user exploration to help discover new user interests, and argue it can improve user experience even in the more imminent term.<br>We examine the role of user exploration in changing different facets of recommendation quality that more directly impact user experience. To do so, we introduce a series of methods inspired by exploration research in RL to increase user exploration in an RL-based recommender system, and study their effect on the end recommendation quality, more specifically, on accuracy, diversity, novelty and serendipity. We propose a set of metrics to measure (RL based) recommender systems in these four aspects and evaluate the impact of exploration-induced methods against these metrics. In addition to the offline measurements, we conduct live experiments on an industrial recommendation platform serving billions of users to showcase the benefit of user exploration. Moreover, we use conversion of casual users to core users as an indicator of the holistic long-term user experience and study the values of user exploration in helping platforms convert users. Through offline analyses and live experiments, we study the correlation between these four facets of recommendation quality and long term user experience, and connect serendipity to improved long term user experience.</p>

    <h3>Addressing Cold Start for Next-song Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Hsuan Yang, Jyh-Shing Roger Jang, Szu-Yu Chou, Yu-Ching Lin</p>
    <p>The cold start problem arises in various recommendation applications. In this paper, we propose a tensor factorization-based algorithm that exploits content features extracted from music audio to deal with the cold start problem for the emerging application next-song recommendation. Specifically, the new algorithm learns sequential behavior to predict the next song that a user would be interested in based on the last song the user just listened to. A unique characteristic of the algorithm is that it learns and updates the mapping between the audio feature space and the item latent space each time during the iterations of the factorization process. This way, the content features can be better exploited in forming the latent features for both users and items, leading to more effective solutions for cold-start recommendation. Evaluation on a large-scale music recommendation dataset shows that the recommendation result of the proposed algorithm exhibits not only higher accuracy but also better novelty and diversity, suggesting its applicability in helping a user explore new items in next-item recommendation. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/fearofchou/ALMM.</p>
