    <h3>Deep Exploration for Recommendation Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheqing Zhu, Benjamin Van Roy</p>
    <p>Modern recommendation systems ought to benefit by probing for and learning from delayed feedback.  Research has tended to focus on learning from a user’s response to a single recommendation.  Such work, which leverages methods of supervised and bandit learning, forgoes learning from the user’s subsequent behavior.  Where past work has aimed to learn from subsequent behavior, there has been a lack of effective methods for probing to elicit informative delayed feedback.  Effective exploration through probing for delayed feedback becomes particularly challenging when rewards are delayed and sparse.  To address this, we develop deep exploration methods for recommendation systems.  In particular, we formulate recommendation as a sequential decision problem and demonstrate benefits of deep exploration over single-step exploration. Our experiments are carried out with high-fidelity industrial-grade simulators and establish large improvements over existing algorithms.</p>

    <h3>Predicting User Routines with Masked Dilated Convolutions (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dragomir Yankov, Senthil Palanisamy, Renzhong Wang, Wei Wu, Siddhartha Arora, Michael R. Evans</p>
    <p>Predicting users daily location visits – when and where they will go, and how long they will stay – is key for making effective location-based recommendations. Knowledge of an upcoming day allows the suggestion of relevant alternatives (e.g., a new coffee shop on the way to work) in advance, prior to a visit. This helps users make informed decisions and plan accordingly. People’s visit routines, or just routines, can vary significantly from day to day, and visits from earlier in the day, week, or month may affect subsequent choices. Traditionally, routine prediction has been modeled with sequence methods, such as HMMs or more recently with RNN-based architectures. However, the problem with such architectures is that their predictive performance degrades when increasing the number of historical observations in the routine sequence. In this paper, we propose Masked-TCN (MTCN), a novel method based on time-dilated convolutional networks. The method implements custom dilations and masking which can process effectively long routine sequences, identifying recurring patterns at different resolution – hourly, daily, weekly, monthly. We demonstrate that MTCN achieves 8% improvement in accuracy over current state-of-the-art solutions on a large data set of visit routines. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>
