    <h3>Reverse Maximum Inner Product Search: How to efficiently find users who would like to buy my item? (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daichi Amagata, Takahiro Hara</p>
    <p>The MIPS (maximum inner product search), which finds the item with the highest inner product with a given query user, is an essential problem in the recommendation field. It is usual that e-commerce companies face situations where they want to promote and sell new or discounted items. In these situations, we have to consider a question: who are interested in the items and how to find them? This paper answers this question by addressing a new problem called reverse maximum inner product search (reverse MIPS). Given a query vector and two sets of vectors (user vectors and item vectors), the problem of reverse MIPS finds a set of user vectors whose inner product with the query vector is the maximum among the query and item vectors. Although the importance of this problem is clear, its straightforward implementation incurs a computationally expensive cost.<br>We therefore propose Simpfer, a simple, fast, and exact algorithm for reverse MIPS. In an offline phase, Simpfer builds a simple index that maintains a lower-bound of the maximum inner product. By exploiting this index, Simpfer judges whether the query vector can have the maximum inner product or not, for a given user vector, in a constant time. Besides, our index enables filtering user vectors, which cannot have the maximum inner product with the query vector, in a batch. We theoretically demonstrate that Simpfer outperforms baselines employing state-of-the-art MIPS techniques. Furthermore, our extensive experiments on real datasets show that Simpfer is about 500–8000 times faster than the baselines.</p>

    <h3>Sustainability at Scale: Bridging the Intention-Behavior Gap with Sustainable Recommendations (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lise Getoor, Ben London, Steven Isley, Sabina Tomkins</p>
    <p>We present an approach for jointly discovering sustainable products and sustainability-minded customers while making recommendations informed by these discoveries. Identifying sustainable products, and the customers who are interested in purchasing them, can improve customer satisfaction while also having a potentially large positive environmental impact. Finding sustainable products and evaluating their claims is a significant barrier facing sustainability-minded customers. Tools that reduce both these burdens are likely to boost the sale of sustainable products. However, it is difficult to determine the sustainability characteristics of these products — there are a variety of certifications and definitions of sustainability, and quality labeling requires input from domain experts. In this paper, we propose a flexible probabilistic framework that uses domain knowledge to identify sustainable products and customers, and uses these labels to predict customer purchases. We evaluate our approach on grocery items from the Amazon catalog. Our proposed approach outperforms established recommender system models in predicting future purchases while jointly inferring sustainability scores for customers and products.</p>

    <h3>Decomposing Fit Semantics for Product Size Recommendation in Metric Spaces (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian McAuley, Mengting Wan, Rishabh Misra</p>
    <p>Product size recommendation and fit prediction are critical in order to improve customers’ shopping experiences and to reduce product return rates. Modeling customers’ fit feedback is challenging due to its subtle semantics, arising from the subjective evaluation of products, and imbalanced label distribution. In this paper, we propose a new predictive framework to tackle the product fit problem, which captures the semantics behind customers’ fit feedback, and employs a metric learning technique to resolve label imbalance issues. We also contribute two public datasets collected from online clothing retailers.</p>

    <h3>Genre Prediction to Inform the Recommendation Process (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Soledad Pera, Nevena Dragovic</p>
    <p>In this paper we present a time-based genre prediction strategy that can inform the book recommendation process. To explicitly consider time in predicting genres of interest, we rely on a popular time series forecasting model as well as reading patterns of each individual reader or group of readers (in case of libraries or publishing companies). Based on a conducted initial assessment using the Amazon dataset, we demonstrate our strategy outperforms its baseline counterpart.</p>
