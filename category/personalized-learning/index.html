    <h3>KA-Recsys: Knowledge Appropriate Patient Focused Recommendation Technologies (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khushboo Thaker</p>
    <p>Diseases such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease demand that patients take an active role in disease management and seek health information for decision-making and self-management [ 1]. The most common methods of providing reliable information to patients include health literacy workshops and patient education materials [12 , 15 ]. However, these materials are prepared for the general patient population and not always tailored to each patient’s specific needs [ 2, 12 ]. In addition, patients seek for their information needs through search engines. Previous studies have reported that search engines don’t always support information needs of patients [11 ]. Consequently, people seek information on disease specific online health communities (OHCs) [ 9 ]. But the risk of propagating misinformation still exists because existing OHCs do not provide an infrastructure to help patients find relevant and trustworthy information [ 8, 19 ].Existing patient focused health search engines and health recommender systems can accommodate better support of patients’ information needs by providing them trustworthy resources. However, current PHRS are personalized to patients’ interests and so information provided by these layperson-oriented systems is rather general [5, 6]. In fact, previous study has shown that a patient’s personal knowledge about their disease becomes more sophisticated over the course of disease [6 , 7]. Therefore, our principal motivation is to fill this gap in current PHRS, by investigating ways to suggest individualized health information that not only adapts to patients’ current information needs but also patients’ knowledge-level across the disease trajectory. The health materials recommended at the level of patients’ knowledge will not only help them engage with materials but also help in informed decision making and self management [16]. The goal of this research is to enhance state-of-the-art PHRS by exploring the technologies in the field of recommender systems and personalized learning so that PHRS can better suggest health information relevant to patients, which is appropriate to their changing knowledge level and in-line with their dynamic information need across their disease trajectory. Thus my research proposes a recommender that accommodates both patient interest and patient knowledge by integrating a patient knowledge model. The output of this research would be a knowledge-appropriate patient focused recommender system (KA-Recsys). As a case study, KA-Recsys will be implemented for ovarian cancer (OvCa) patients and integrated into HELPeR1.</p>

    <h3>Developing Recommendation System to provide a Personalized Learning experience at Chegg (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deb Sanghamitra</p>
    <p>Online learning has become the primary source of education in 2020 with the impact of COVID-19 forcing millions of students to stay at home. In order to personalize the learning experience we have built a recommendation system that takes advantage of the  (1) Rich content developed at Chegg (2) An excellent knowledge graph that organizes content in a hierarchical fashion (3) Interaction of students across multiple products to enhance user signal in individual products.<br>Chegg is a centralized learning platform. Students visit Chegg to get help with homework using Chegg Study, learn from flashcards for their tests, practice examinations, learn relevant concepts, work with a tutor online to get one on one learning experience. This represents a large amount of content available to students. In order to organize the content we have developed a Knowledge Graph with nodes representing a hierarchical scheme of concepts  taught at different educational institutions and the content at Chegg. In order to create edges between concept nodes and content we build text classifiers to tag content with concept nodes.<br>Often students will interact with one or two products such as Chegg Study or Text Book rentals and browse other products such as flashcards, exam practice, etc. In order to suggest relevant content to them, we deduce the concepts they have been studying in products where they are more active and suggest content in products where they are less active.<br>In this presentation I will talk about the general framework for developing personalized recommendations at Chegg and do a deep dive into (1) Text classifiers required for content tagging and (2) Building cross product recommendations. In text classification,  I will go into details about working with noisy training data and model improvements using multi-task learning [1]. For cross product recommendations I will talk about combining user signals from multiple products [2] to deduce general pattern of student interest and use that information to retrieve relevant content — for example flashcards or practice exams for users.</p>

    <h3>Recommending Learning Materials to Students by Identifying their Knowledge Gaps (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Tuzhilin, Konstantin Bauman</p>
    <p>We propose a new content-based method of providing recommendations of educational materials to the students by identifying gaps in their knowledge of the subject matter in the courses they take. We experimentally validate our method by conducting an A/B test on the students from an online university.</p>
