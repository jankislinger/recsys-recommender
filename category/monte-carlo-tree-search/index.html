    <h3>Leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search for Group Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Andres Diaz-Pace, Antonela Tommasel</p>
    <p>Group recommenders aim to provide recommendations that satisfy the collective preferences of multiple users, a challenging task due to the diverse individual tastes and conflicting interests to be balanced. This is often accomplished by using aggregation techniques that select items on which the group can agree. Traditional aggregators struggle with these complexities, as items are chosen independently, leading to sub-optimal recommendations lacking diversity, novelty, or fairness. In this paper, we propose an aggregation technique that leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance group recommendations. MCTS is used to explore and evaluate candidate recommendation sequences to optimize overall group satisfaction. We also investigate the integration of MCTS with LLMs aiming at better understanding interactions between user preferences and recommendation sequences to inform the search. Experimental evaluations, although preliminary, showed that our proposal outperforms existing aggregation techniques in terms of relevance and beyond-accuracy aspects of recommendations. The LLM integration achieved positive results for recommendations’ relevance. Overall, this work highlights the potential of heuristic search techniques to tackle the complexities of group recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Fast And Accurate User Cold-Start Learning Using Monte Carlo Tree Search (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Douglas Leith, Dilina Chandika Rajapakse</p>
    <p>We revisit the cold-start task for new users of a recommender system whereby a new user is asked to rate a few items with the aim of discovering the user’s preferences. This is a combinatorial stochastic learning task, and so difficult in general. In this paper we propose using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to dynamically select the sequence of items presented to a new user. We find that this new MCTS-based cold-start approach is able to consistently quickly identify the preferences of a user with significantly higher accuracy than with either a decision-tree or a state of the art bandit-based approach without incurring higher regret i.e the learning performance is fundamentally superior to that of the state of the art. This boost in recommender accuracy is achieved in a computationally lightweight fashion.</p>

    <h3>The Art of Drafting: A Team-Oriented Hero Recommendation System for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Games (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuyu Xu, Zhengxing Chen, Chris Amato, Truong-Huy D. Nguyen, Yizhou Sun, Seth Cooper, Magy Seif El-Nasr</p>
    <p>Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games have received increasing popularity recently. In a match of such games, players compete in two teams of five, each controlling an in-game avatars, known as heroes, selected from a roster of more than 100. The selection of heroes, also known as pick or draft, takes place before the match starts and alternates between the two teams until each player has selected one hero. Heroes are designed with different strengths and weaknesses to promote team cooperation in a game. Intuitively, heroes in a strong team should complement each other’s strengths and suppressing those of opponents. Hero drafting is therefore a challenging problem due to the complex hero-to-hero relationships to consider. In this paper, we propose a novel hero recommendation system that suggests heroes to add to an existing team while maximizing the team’s prospect for victory. To that end, we model the drafting between two teams as a combinatorial game and use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for estimating the values of hero combinations. Our empirical evaluation shows that hero teams drafted by our recommendation algorithm have significantly higher win rate against teams constructed by other baseline and state-of-the-art strategies.</p>
