    <h3>A Recommender System for Heterogeneous and Time Sensitive Environment (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying Zhu, Meng Wu, Qilian Yu, Navid Aghdaie, Kazi A. Zaman, Yunqi Zhao, Bhargav Rajendra</p>
    <p>The digital game industry has recently adopted recommender systems to deliver the most relevant content and suggest the most suitable activities to players. Because of diverse game designs and dynamic experiences, recommender systems typically operate in highly heterogeneous and time-sensitive environments. In this paper, we describe a recommender system at a digital game company which aims to provide recommendations for a large variety of use-cases while being easy to integrate and operate. The system leverages a unified data platform, standardized context and tracking data pipelines, robust naive linear contextual multi-armed bandit algorithms, and experimentation platform for extensibility as well as flexibility. Several games and applications have successfully launched with the recommender system and have achieved significant improvements.</p>

    <h3>Recommending Repeat Purchases using Product Segment Statistics (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kratika Gupta, Pabitra Mitra, Suvodip Dey</p>
    <p>Repeat Purchases have become increasingly important in measuring customer’s satisfaction and loyalty to e-commerce websites in regard to online shopping. In this paper, we first propose a model for estimating repeat purchase frequency in a given time period from a given product category using Poisson/Gamma model. Second, we estimate the purchase probabilities of different product types in a product category for each customer using Dirichlet model. Experimental results on data collected by a real-world e-commerce website show that it can predict a user’s average repeat purchase frequency along with their product types with decent accuracy. We also argue that the output of our models can be used as prior information to enhance the performance of time-sensitive recommendation.</p>
