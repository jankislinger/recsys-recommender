    <h3>Incorporating Time in Sequential Recommendation Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Caverlee, Mostafa Rahmani, Fei Wang</p>
    <p>Sequential models are designed to learn sequential patterns in data based on the chronological order of user interactions. However, they often ignore the timestamps of these interactions. Incorporating time is crucial because many sequential patterns are time-dependent, and the model cannot make time-aware recommendations without considering time. This article demonstrates that providing a rich representation of time can significantly improve the performance of sequential models. The existing literature treats time as a one-dimensional time-series obtained by quantizing time. In this study, we propose treating time as a multi-dimensional time-series and explore representation learning methods, including  a kernel based method and an embedding-based algorithm. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the inclusion of time significantly enhances the model’s performance, and multi-dimensional methods outperform the one-dimensional method by a substantial margin.</p>

    <h3>Query Attribute Recommendation at Amazon Search (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Gao, William Headean, Zheng Li, Qingyu Yin, Rahul Goutam, Haoming Jiang, Neela Avudaiappan, Tianyu Cao, Haiyang Zhang, Bing Yin, Chen Luo</p>
    <p>Query understanding models extract attributes from search queries, like color, product type, brand, etc. Search engines rely on these attributes for ranking, advertising, and recommendation, etc. However, product search queries are usually short, three or four words on average. This information shortage limits the search engine’s power to provide high-quality services.<br>In this talk, we would like to share our year-long journey in solving the information shortage problem and introduce an end-to-end system for attribute recommendation at Amazon Search. We showcase how the system works and how the system contributes to the long-term user experience through offline and online experiments at Amazon Search. We hope this talk can inspire more follow-up works in understanding and improving attribute recommendations in product search.</p>

    <h3>Chemical Reactant Recommendation using a Network of Organic Chemistry (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ernesto Diaz-Aviles, Carlos Alzate, Akihiro Kishimoto, John Savage, Beat Buesser</p>
    <p>This paper presents recommendation algorithms for novel applications in chemistry. We focus on the task of recommending to the chemist candidate molecules (reactants) necessary to synthesize a given target molecule (product), which is an important step for the chemist to find a synthesis route to generate the product. We formulate this task as a link-prediction problem over a so-called Network of Organic Chemistry (NOC) that we have constructed from 8 million chemical reactions described in the US patent literature between 1976 and 2013. We leverage state-of-the-art factorization algorithms for recommender systems to solve this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Factorization Machines, trained with chemistry-specific knowledge, outperforms current methods based on similarity of chemical structures.</p>

    <h3>Do you have a Pop face? Here is a Pop song. Using profile pictures to mitigate the cold-start problem in Music Recommender Systems. (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugenio Tacchini, Ramon Morros, Enrique Sañoso, Veronica Vilaplana</p>
    <p>When a new user registers to a recommender system service, the system does not know her taste and cannot propose meaningful suggestions (cold-start problem). This preliminary work attempts to mitigate the cold-start problem using the profile picture of the user as a sole information, following the intuition that a correspondence may exist between the pictures that people use to represent themselves and their taste. We proved that, at least in the small music community we used for our experiments, our method can improve the precision of both a classifier and a Top-N music recommender system in a cold-start condition.</p>

    <h3>Personality-Based Recommendations: Evidence from Amazon.com (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Panagiotis Adamopoulos, Vilma Todri</p>
    <p>In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of personality-based recommendations using a real-world data set from Amazon.com. We automatically infer the personality traits, needs, and values of users based on unstructured user-generated content in social media, rather than administering questionnaires or explicitly asking the users to self-report their characteristics. We find that personality characteristics significantly increase the performance of recommender systems, in general, while different personality models exhibit statistically significant differences in predictive performance.</p>

    <h3>Adaptation and Evaluation of Recommendations for Short-term Shopping Goals (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Jugovac, Dietmar Jannach, Lukas Lerche</p>
    <p>An essential characteristic in many of e-commerce settings is that website visitors can have very specific short-term shopping goals when they browse the site. Relying solely on long-term user models that are pre-trained on historical data can therefore be insufficient for recommendation. Simple “real-time” recommendation approaches based, e.g., on unpersonalized co-occurrence patterns, on the other hand do not fully exploit the available information about the user’s long-term preference profile. In this work, we aim to explore and quantify the effectiveness of using and combining long-term models and short-term adaptation strategies. We conducted an empirical evaluation based on a novel evaluation design and two real-world datasets. The results indicate that maintaining short-term and profiles of the visitors can lead to significant accuracy increases. At the same time, the experiments show that the choice of the algorithm for learning the long term preferences is particularly important at the beginning of new shopping sessions.</p>
