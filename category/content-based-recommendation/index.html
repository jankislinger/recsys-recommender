    <h3>A Multi-modal Modeling Framework for Cold-start Short-video Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Gai, Han Li, Ruina Sun, Jingjian Lin, Xinghua Zhang, Gaode Chen, Qi Zhang, Jiangxia Cao, Yuezihan Jiang</p>
    <p>Short video has witnessed rapid growth in the past few years in multimedia platforms. To ensure the freshness of the videos, platforms receive a large number of user-uploaded videos every day, making collaborative filtering-based recommender methods suffer from the item cold-start problem (e.g., the new-coming videos are difficult to compete with existing videos). Consequently, increasing efforts tackle the cold-start issue from the content perspective, focusing on modeling the multi-modal preferences of users, a fair way to compete with new-coming and existing videos. However, recent studies ignore the existing gap between multi-modal embedding extraction and user interest modeling as well as the discrepant intensities of user preferences for different modalities. In this paper, we propose M3CSR, a multi-modal modeling framework for cold-start short video recommendation. Specifically, we preprocess content-oriented multi-modal features for items and obtain trainable category IDs by performing clustering. In each modality, we combine modality-specific cluster ID embedding and the mapped original modality feature as modality-specific representation of the item to address the gap. Meanwhile, M3CSR measures the user modality-specific intensity based on the correlation between modality-specific interest and behavioral interest and employs pairwise loss to further decouple user multi-modal interests. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model. The framework has been deployed on a billion-user scale short video application and has shown improvements in various commercial metrics within cold-start scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Reducing Cross-Topic Political Homogenization in Content-Based News Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aron Culotta, Karthik Shivaram, Matthew Shapiro, Mustafa Bilgic, Ping Liu</p>
    <p>Content-based news recommenders learn words that correlate with user engagement and recommend articles accordingly. This can be problematic for users with diverse political preferences by topic — e.g., users that prefer conservative articles on one topic but liberal articles on another. In such instances, recommenders can have a homogenizing effect by recommending articles with the same political lean on both topics, particularly if both topics share salient, politically polarized terms like “far right” or “radical left.” In this paper, we propose attention-based neural network models to reduce this homogenization effect by increasing attention on words that are topic specific while decreasing attention on polarized, topic-general terms. We find that the proposed approach results in more accurate recommendations for simulated users with such diverse preferences.</p>

    <h3>Discovery Dynamics: Leveraging Repeated Exposure for User and Music Characterization (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Sguerra, Viet-Anh Tran, Romain Hennequin</p>
    <p>Repetition in music consumption is a common phenomenon. It is notably more frequent when compared to the consumption of other media, such as books and movies. In this paper, we show that one particularly interesting repetitive behavior arises when users are consuming new items. Users’ interest tends to rise with the first repetitions and attains a peak after which interest will decrease with subsequent exposures, resulting in an inverted-U shape. This behavior, which has been extensively studied in psychology, is called the mere exposure effect. In this paper, we show how a number of factors, both content and user-based, well documented in the literature on the mere exposure effect, modulate the magnitude of the effect. Due to the vast availability of data of users discovering new songs everyday in music streaming platforms, this findings enable new ways to characterize both the music, users and their relationships. Ultimately, it opens up the possibility of developing new recommender systems paradigms based on these characterizations.</p>

    <h3>Adaptive Pointwise-Pairwise Learning-to-Rank for Content-based Personalized Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Michel Renders, Yagmur Gizem Cinar</p>
    <p>This paper extends the standard pointwise and pairwise paradigms for learning-to-rank in the context of personalized recommendation, by considering these two approaches as two extremes of a continuum of possible strategies. It basically consists of a surrogate loss that models how to select and combine these two approaches adaptively, depending on the context (query or user, pair of items, etc.). In other words, given a training instance, which is typically a triplet (a query/user and two items with different preferences or relevance grades), the strategy adaptively determines whether it is better to focus on the “most preferred” item (pointwise - positive instance), on the “less preferred” one (pointwise - negative instance) or on the pair (pairwise), or on anything else in between these 3 extreme alternatives. We formulate this adaptive strategy as minimizing a particular loss function that generalizes simultaneously the traditional pointwise and pairwise loss functions (negative log-likelihood) through a mixture coefficient. This coefficient is formulated as a learnable function of the features associated to the triplet. Experimental results on several real-world news recommendation datasets show clear improvements over several pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches.</p>

    <h3>Representation Learning for Image-based Music Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yian Chen, Ming-Feng Tsai, Kwei-Herng Lai, Chuan-Ju Wang, Chih-Chun Hsia</p>
    <p>Image perception is one of the most direct ways to provide contextual information about a user concerning his/her surrounding environment; hence images are a suitable proxy for contextual recommendation. We propose a novel representation learning framework for image-based music recommendation that bridges the heterogeneity gap between music and image data; the proposed method is a key component for various contextual recommendation tasks. Preliminary experiments show that for an image-to-song retrieval task, the proposed method retrieves relevant or conceptually similar songs for input images.</p>

    <h3>User Preferences in Recommendation Algorithms: The Influence of User Diversity, Trust, and Product Category on Privacy Perceptions in Recommender Algorithms (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> André Calero Valdez, Johannes Nakayama, Martina Ziefle, Nils Plettenberg, Laura Burbach</p>
    <p>The use of recommendation systems is widespread in online commerce. Depending on the algorithm that is used in the recommender system different types of data are recorded from user interactions. Typically better recommendations are achieved when more detailed data about the user and product is available. However, users are often unaware of what data is stored and how it is used in recommendation. In a survey study with 197 participants we introduced different recommendation techniques (collaborative filtering, content-based recommendation, trust-based and social recommendation) to the users and asked participants to rate what type of algorithm should be used for what type of product category (books, mobile phones, contraceptives). We found different patterns of preferences for different product categories. The more sensitive the product the higher the preference for content-based filtering approaches that could work without storing personal data. Trust-based and social approaches utilizing data from social media were generally rejected.</p>

    <h3>Word Embedding techniques for Content-based Recommender Systems: an empirical evaluation (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Lops, Marco De Gemmis, Cataldo Musto, Giovanni Semeraro</p>
    <p>This work presents an empirical comparison among three widespread techniques as Latent Semantic Indexing, Random Indexing and the more recent Word2Vec. Specifically, we employed these techniques to learn a low-dimensional vector space and we exploited it to represent both items and user profiles in a recommendation scenario. The performance of the techniques has been evaluated against two state-of-the-art datasets, and experimental results provided good insights which pave the way to several future directions.</p>
