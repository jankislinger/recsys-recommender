    <h3>Instructing and Prompting Large Language Models for Explainable Cross-domain Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Petruzzelli, Cataldo Musto, Pasquale Lops, Marco de Gemmis, Ivan Rinaldi, Giovanni Semeraro, Lucrezia Laraspata</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present a strategy to provide users with explainable cross-domain recommendations (CDR) that exploits large language models (LLMs). Generally speaking, cross-domain recommender systems typically suffer of data sparsity issues, since they require a large amount of data labeled in both base and target domains, which are not easy to collect. Accordingly, our approach relies on the intuition that the knowledge that is already encoded in LLMs can be used to bridge the domains and seamlessly provide users with personalized cross-domain suggestions. To this end, we designed a pipeline to: (a) instruct a LLM to handle a CDR task; (b) design a personalized prompt, based on the preferences of the user in a base domain, in both zero-shot and one-shot settings; (c) feed the LLM with the prompt, and process the answer in order to extract the recommendations in a target domain, together with a natural language explanation supporting the suggestion. As shown in the experimental evaluation, our approach beats several established state-of-the-art baselines for CDR in most of the experimental settings, thus showing the effectiveness of LLMs also in this novel and scarcely investigated scenario.</p>

    <h3>TLRec: A Transfer Learning Framework to Enhance Large Language Models for Sequential Recommendation Tasks (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuang Peng, Jiaye Lin, Zhong Zhang, Peilin Zhao</p>
    <p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in recommendation systems, improving recommendation performance through in-context learning or parameter-efficient fine-tuning. However, cross-domain generalization, i.e., model training in one scenario (source domain) but inference in another (target domain), is underexplored. In this paper, we present TLRec, a transfer learning framework aimed at enhancing LLMs for sequential recommendation tasks. TLRec specifically focuses on text inputs to mitigate the challenge of limited transferability across diverse domains, offering promising advantages over traditional recommendation models that heavily depend on unique identities (IDs) like user IDs and item IDs. Moreover, we leverage the source domain data to further enhance LLMs’ performance in the target domain. Initially, we employ powerful closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) and chain-of-thought techniques to construct instruction tuning data from the third-party scenario (source domain). Subsequently, we apply curriculum learning to fine-tune LLMs for effective knowledge injection and perform recommendations in the target domain. Experimental results demonstrate that TLRec achieves superior performance under the zero-shot and few-shot settings.</p>

    <h3>Station and Track Attribute-Aware Music Personalization (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Jeffrey Mei, Oliver Bembom, Andreas Ehmann</p>
    <p>We present a transformer for music personalization that recommends tracks given a station seed (artist) and improves the accuracy vs. a baseline matrix factorization method by 10%. Adding more embeddings to capture track and station attributes further improves the accuracy of our recommendations, and also improves recommendation diversity, i.e. mitigates popularity bias. We analyze the learned embeddings and find they learn both explicit attributes provided at training and implicit attributes that may inform listener preferences. We also find that unlike matrix factorization, our model can identify and transfer relevant listener preferences across different genres and artists.</p>

    <h3>Visual Representation for Capturing Creator Theme in Brand-Creator Marketplace (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keren Gaiger, Shaked Zychlinski, Ravid Cohen, Sarel Duanis, Asnat Greenstein-Messica</p>
    <p>Providing cold start recommendations in a brand-creator marketplace is challenging as brands’ preferences extend beyond the mere objects depicted in the creator’s content and encompass the creator’s individual theme consistently resonates across images shared on her social media profile. Furthermore, brands often use textual keywords to describe their campaign’s aesthetic appeal, with which creators must align. To address these challenges, we propose two methods: SAME (Same Account Media Embedding), a novel creator representation employing a Siamese network to capture the unique creator theme and OAAR (Object-Agnostic Adjective Representation), enabling filtering creators based on textual adjectives that relate to aesthetic qualities through zero-shot learning. These two methods utilize CLIP, a state-of-the-art language-image model, and improve it in addressing the aforementioned challenges.</p>

    <h3>Optimizing product recommendations for millions of merchants (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Karako, Kim Peiter Jorgensen</p>
    <p>At Shopify, we serve product recommendations to customers across millions of merchants’ online stores. It is a challenge to provide optimized recommendations to all of these independent merchants; one model might lead to an overall improvement in our metrics on aggregate, but significantly degrade recommendations for some stores. To ensure we provide high quality recommendations to all merchant segments, we develop several models that work best in different situations as determined in offline evaluation. Learning which strategy best works for a given segment also allows us to start off new stores with good recommendations, without necessarily needing to rely on an individual store amassing large amounts of traffic. In production, the system will start out with the best strategy for a given merchant, and then adjust to the current environment using multi-armed bandits. Collectively, this methodology allows us to optimize the types of recommendations served on each store.</p>

    <h3>Leveraging Multi-Faceted User Preferences for Improving Click-Through Rate Predictions (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan Li</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have been widely adopted by many firms across various industries over the past decade, as they could provide numerous economic benefits to the industry, such as influencing consumer choices, generating the lift in sales, and enhancing consumer trust. Many currently-deployed recommender systems primiarily optimize the similarity measure following the Collaborative Filtering paradigm during the recommendation performance, which focuses on the matching between targeted users and items of their interests. Although effective and useful in many cases, these still face several important challenges to fully address consumers’ concerns. In particular, they usually provide recommendations of the most similar items related to the consumption records, without taking into account the multi-faceted consumer preferences. For example, some consumers would be satisfied to receive recommendations that are novel and unexpected to broaden their horizons, while others might be interested to receive recommendations from other product categories to expand their interests. Falling to do so would lead to the filter bubble and exploration-exploitation trade-off phenomenon, which is undesirable because it would significantly reduce sales diversity and deteriorate user satisfaction with recommender systems.<br>In my thesis proposal, I will describe new methods to design recommender systems following two research streams to tackle the aforementioned challenges, namely unexpected recommender system and cross-domain system. In particular, unexpected recommender systems address consumers’ desire for variety, and aim at providing novel and useful recommendations simultaneously, while cross-domain recommender systems learn consumer preferences from their behaviors in other domains to better predict their behaviors in the target domain. The proposed models are capable of significantly improving recommendation performance and user satisfaction, as demonstrated through extensive offline and online experiments discussed in this proposal.</p>

    <h3>Learning Consumer and Producer Embeddings for User-Generated Content Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian McAuley, Wang-Cheng Kang</p>
    <p>User-Generated Content (UGC) is at the core of web applications where users can both produce and consume content. This differs from traditional e-Commerce domains where content producers and consumers are usually from two separate groups. In this work, we propose a method CPRec (consumer and producer based recommendation), for recommending content on UGC-based platforms. Specifically, we learn a core embedding for each user and two transformation matrices to project the user’s core embedding into two ‘role’ embeddings (i.e., a producer and consumer role). We model each interaction by the ternary relation between the consumer, the consumed item, and its producer. Empirical studies on two large-scale UGC applications show that our method outperforms standard collaborative filtering methods as well as recent methods that model producer information via item features.</p>

    <h3>Multi Cross Domain Recommendation Using Item Embedding And Canonical Correlation Analysis (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Kazama, Istvan Varga</p>
    <p>In a multi-service environment it is crucial to be able to leverage user behavior from one or more domains to create personalized recommendations in the other domain. In our paper, we present a robust transfer learning approach that successfully captures user behavior across multiple domains. First, we vectorize users and items in each domain independently. Second, using a handful of common users across domain pairs, we project each domain vector space into a common vector space using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Next, recommendations can be performed by recommending the items in any domains that are closest to the user’s vector in the common space. We also experimented on what kind of domain combination works well.</p>

    <h3>Cross Domain Recommendation Using Vector Space Transfer Learning (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Kazama, Istvan Varga</p>
    <p>The cold start problem, frequent with recommender systems, addresses the issue in cases where we don’t know enough about our users (e.g., the user hasn’t rated anything yet, or there are no user activities) in that specific domain. In our paper we present a simple and robust transfer learning approach where we model users’ behavior in a source domain, transferring that knowledge to a new, target domain. First, we vectorize the items by using word2vec for each dataset independently. Second, we calculate the transformation matrix that connects the source dataset to the target dataset by using their common users.</p>

    <h3>Accuracy and Diversity in Cross-domain Recommendations for Cold-start Users with Positive-only Feedback (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tommaso Di Noia, Eugenio Di Sciascio, Paolo Tomeo, Ignacio Fernández-Tobías, Iván Cantador</p>
    <p>Computing useful recommendations for cold-start users is a major challenge in the design of recommender systems, and additional data is often required to compensate the scarcity of user feedback. In this paper we address such problem in a target domain by exploiting user preferences from a related auxiliary domain. Following a rigorous methodology for cold-start, we evaluate a number of recommendation methods on a dataset with positive-only feedback in the movie and music domains, both in single and cross-domain scenarios. Comparing the methods in terms of item ranking accuracy, diversity and catalog coverage, we show that cross-domain preference data is useful to provide more accurate suggestions when user feedback in the target domain is scarce or not available at all, and may lead to more diverse recommendations depending on the target domain. Moreover, evaluating the impact of the user profile size and diversity in the source domain, we show that, in general, the quality of target recommendations increases with the size of the profile, but may deteriorate with too diverse profiles.</p>

    <h3>It Takes Two to Tango: an Exploration of Domain Pairs for Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaghayegh Sahebi, Peter Brusilovsky</p>
    <p>As the heterogeneity of data sources are increasing on the web, and due to the sparsity of data in each of these data sources, cross-domain recommendation is becoming an emerging research topic in the recent years. Cross-domain collaborative filtering aims to transfer the user rating pattern from source (auxiliary) domains to a target domain for the purpose of alleviating the sparsity problem and providing better target recommendations. However, the studies so far have either focused on a limited number of domains that are assumed to be related to each other (such as books and movies), or a division of the same dataset (such as movies) into different domains based on an item characteristic (such as genre). In this paper, we study a broad set of domains and their characteristics to understand the factors that affect the success or failure of cross-domain collaborative filtering, the amount of improvement in cross-domain approaches, and the selection of best source domains for a specific target domain. We propose to use Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) as a significant major factor in finding the most promising source domains for a target domain, and suggest a cross-domain collaborative filtering based on CCA (CD-CCA) that proves to be successful in using the shared information between domains in the target recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Cross-Domain Recommendations Without Overlapping Data: Myth or Reality? (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Cremonesi, Massimo Quadrana</p>
    <p>Cross-domain recommender systems adopt different tech- niques to transfer learning from source domain to target domain in order to alleviate the sparsity problem and improve accuracy of recommendations. Traditional techniques require the two domains to be linked by shared characteristics associated to either users or items. In collaborative-filtering (CF) this happens when the two domains have overlapping users or item (at least partially). Recently, Li et al. [7] introduced codebook transfer (CBT), a cross-domain CF technique based on co-clustering, and presented experimental results showing that CBT is able to transfer knowledge between non-overlapping domains. In this paper, we disprove these results and show that CBT does not transfer useful knowledge when source and target domains do not overlap.</p>

    <h3>`Free Lunch’ Enhancement for Collaborative Filtering with Factorization Machines (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martha Larson, Alan Hanjalic, Babak Loni, Alan Said</p>
    <p>The advantage of Factorization Machines over other factorization models is their ability to easily integrate and efficiently exploit auxiliary information to improve Collaborative Filtering. Until now, this auxiliary information has been drawn from external knowledge sources beyond the user-item matrix. In this paper, we demonstrate that Factorization Machines can exploit additional representations of information inherent in the user-item matrix to improve recommendation performance. We refer to our approach as “Free Lunch” enhancement since it leverages clusters that are based on information that is present in the user-item matrix, but not otherwise directly exploited during matrix factorization. Borrowing clustering concepts from codebook sharing, our approach can also make use of “Free Lunch” information inherent in a user-item matrix from a auxiliary domain that is different from the target domain of the recommender. Our approach improves performance both in the joint case, in which the auxiliary and target domains share users, and in the disjoint case, in which they do not. Although “Free Lunch” enhancement does not apply equally well to any given domain or domain combination, our overall conclusion is that Factorization Machines present an opportunity to exploit information that is ubiquitously present, but commonly under-appreciated by Collaborative Filtering algorithms.</p>
