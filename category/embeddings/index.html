    <h3>Enhancing Sequential Music Recommendation with Negative Feedback-informed Contrastive Learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahrzad Shashaani, Pavan Seshadri, Peter Knees</p>
    <p>Modern music streaming services are heavily based on recommen- dation engines to serve continuous content to users. Sequential recommendation—continuously providing new items within a sin- gle session in a contextually coherent manner—has been an emerg- ing topic in current literature. User feedback—a positive or negative response to the item presented—is used to drive content recom- mendations by learning user preferences. We extend this idea to the session-based recommendation domain to improve learning of context-coherent music recommendations by modelling negative user feedback, i.e., skips, in the loss function. To this end, we propose a sequence-aware contrastive sub-task to structure item embeddings in session-based music recommen- dation, such that true next-positive items (ignoring skipped items) are structured closer in the embedding space, while skipped tracks are structured farther away from all items in the session. Since this causes skipped item embeddings in a session to be farther than unskipped items in the learned space, this directly affects item rankings using a K-nearest-neighbors search for next-item recom- mendations, while also promoting the rank of the true next item. Experiments incorporating this task into SoTA methods for sequen- tial item recommendation show consistent performance gains in terms of next-item hit rate, item ranking, and skip down-ranking on three music recommendation datasets, strongly benefiting from increasing presence of user feedback.</p>

    <h3>GLAMOR: Graph-based LAnguage MOdel embedding for citation Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilin Qi, Adam A. Q. Mohammed, Irfan Ullah, Khan Muhammad, Pavlos Kefalas, Zafar Ali</p>
    <p>Digital publishing’s exponential growth has created vast scholarly collections. Guiding researchers to relevant resources is crucial, and knowledge graphs (KGs) are key tools for unlocking hidden knowledge. However, current methods focus on external links between concepts, ignoring the rich information within individual papers. Challenges like insufficient multi-relational data, name ambiguity, and cold-start issues further limit existing KG-based methods, failing to capture the intricate attributes of diverse entities. To solve these issues, we propose GLAMOR, a robust KG framework encompassing entities e.g., authors, papers, fields of study, and concepts, along with their semantic interconnections. GLAMOR uses a novel random walk-based KG text generation method and then fine-tunes the language model using the generated text. Subsequently, the acquired context-preserving embeddings facilitate superior top@k predictions. Evaluation results on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate our GLAMOR’s superiority against state-of-the-art methods especially in solving the cold-start problem.</p>

    <h3>Knowledge-Aware Recommender Systems based on Multi-Modal Information Sources (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giuseppe Spillo</p>
    <p>The last few years saw a growing interest in Knowledge-Aware Recommender Systems (KARSs), given their capability in encoding and exploiting several data sources, both structured (such as <i>knowledge graphs</i>) and unstructured (such as plain text); indeed, several pieces of research show the competitiveness of these models. Nowadays, a lot of models at the state-of-the-art in KARSs use deep learning, enabling them to exploit large amounts of information, including knowledge graphs (KGs), user reviews, plain text, and multimedia content (pictures, audio, videos). In my Ph.D. I will explore and study techniques for designing KARSs leveraging embeddings deriving from multi-modal information sources; the models I will design will aim at providing fair, accurate, and explainable recommendations.</p>

    <h3>On the Consistency of Average Embeddings for Item Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Romain Hennequin, Thomas Bouabça, Guillaume Salha-Galvan, Walid Bendada, Tristan Cazenave</p>
    <p>A prevalent practice in recommender systems consists of averaging item embeddings to represent users or higher-level concepts in the same embedding space. This paper investigates the relevance of such a practice. For this purpose, we propose an expected precision score, designed to measure the consistency of an average embedding relative to the items used for its construction. We subsequently analyze the mathematical expression of this score in a theoretical setting with specific assumptions, as well as its empirical behavior on real-world data from music streaming services. Our results emphasize that real-world averages are less consistent for recommendation, which paves the way for future research to better align real-world embeddings with assumptions from our theoretical setting.</p>

    <h3>Leveraging Large Language Models for Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Panos Louridas, Dietmar Jannach, Marios Fragkoulis, Wouter Zorgdrager, Jesse Harte, Asterios Katsifodimos</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation problems have received increasing attention in research during the past few years, leading to the inception of a large variety of algorithmic approaches. In this work, we explore how large language models (LLMs), which are nowadays introducing disruptive effects in many AI-based applications, can be used to build or improve sequential recommendation approaches. Specifically, we devise and evaluate three approaches to leverage the power of LLMs in different ways. Our results from experiments on two datasets show that initializing the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation model BERT4Rec with embeddings obtained from an LLM improves NDCG by 15-20% compared to the vanilla BERT4Rec model. Furthermore, we find that a simple approach that leverages LLM embeddings for producing recommendations, can provide competitive performance by highlighting semantically related items. We publicly share the code and data of our experiments to ensure reproducibility.</p>

    <h3>Of Spiky SVDs and Music Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darius Afchar, Romain Hennequin, Vincent Guigue</p>
    <p>The truncated singular value decomposition is a widely used methodology in music recommendation for direct similar-item retrieval or embedding musical items for downstream tasks. This paper investigates a curious effect that we show naturally occurring on many recommendation datasets: spiking formations in the embedding space. We first propose a metric to quantify this spiking organization’s strength, then mathematically prove its origin tied to underlying communities of items of varying internal popularity. With this new-found theoretical understanding, we finally open the topic with an industrial use case of estimating how music embeddings’ top-k similar items will change over time under the addition of data.</p>

    <h3>EANA: Reducing Privacy Risk on Large-scale Recommendation Models (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin Ning, Devora Berlowitz, Mei Chen, Shuang Song, Qiqi Xue, Steve Chien</p>
    <p>Embedding-based deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in large-scale recommendation systems. Differentially-private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) provides a way to enable personalized experiences while preserving user privacy by injecting noise into every model parameter during the training process. However, it is challenging to apply DP-SGD to large-scale embedding-based DNNs due to its effect on training speed. This happens because the noise added by DP-SGD causes normally sparse gradients to become dense, introducing a large communication overhead between workers and parameter servers in a typical distributed training framework. This paper proposes embedding-aware noise addition (EANA) to mitigate the communication overhead, making training a large-scale embedding-based DNN possible. We examine the privacy benefit of EANA both analytically and empirically using secret sharer techniques. We demonstrate that training with EANA can achieve reasonable model precision while providing good practical privacy protection as measured by the secret sharer tests. Experiments on a real-world, large-scale dataset and model show that EANA is much faster than standard DP-SGD, improving the training speed by 54X and unblocking the training of a large-scale embedding-based DNN with reduced privacy risk.</p>

    <h3>BRUCE – Bundle Recommendation Using Contextualized item Embeddings (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Livne, Bracha Shapira, Oren Sar Shalom, Mark Last, Tzoof Avny Brosh</p>
    <p>A bundle is a pre-defined set of items that are collected together. In many domains, bundling is one of the most important marketing strategies for item promotion, commonly used in e-commerce. Bundle recommendation resembles the item recommendation task, where bundles are the recommended unit, but it poses additional challenges; while item recommendation requires only user and item understanding, bundle recommendation also requires modeling the connections between the various items in a bundle. Transformers have driven the state-of-the-art methods for set and sequence modeling in various natural language processing and computer vision tasks, emphasizing the understanding that the neighbors of an element are of crucial importance. Under some required adjustments, we believe the same applies for items in bundles, and better capturing the relations of an item with other items in the bundle may lead to improved recommendations. To address that, we introduce BRUCE - a novel model for bundle recommendation, in which we adapt Transformers to represent data on users, items, and bundles. This allows exploiting the self-attention mechanism to model the following: latent relations between the items in a bundle; and users’ preferences toward each of the items in the bundle and toward the whole bundle. Moreover, we examine various architectures to integrate the items’ and the users’ information and provide insights on architecture selection based on data characteristics. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach contributes to the accuracy of the recommendation and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods</p>

    <h3>Sparse Feature Factorization for Recommender Systems with Knowledge Graphs (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonio Ferrara, Alberto Carlo Maria Mancino, Vito Walter Anelli, Tommaso Di Noia</p>
    <p>Deep Learning and factorization-based collaborative filtering recommendation models have undoubtedly dominated the scene of recommender systems in recent years. However, despite their outstanding performance, these methods require a training time proportional to the size of the embeddings and it further increases when also side information is considered for the computation of the recommendation list. In fact, in these cases we have that with a large number of high-quality features, the resulting models are more complex and difficult to train. This paper addresses this problem by presenting KGFlex: a sparse factorization approach that grants an even greater degree of expressiveness. To achieve this result, KGFlex analyzes the historical data to understand the dimensions the user decisions depend on (e.g., movie direction, musical genre, nationality of book writer). KGFlex represents each item feature as an embedding and it models user-item interactions as a factorized entropy-driven combination of the item attributes relevant to the user. KGFlex facilitates the training process by letting users update only those relevant features on which they base their decisions. In other words, the user-item prediction is mediated by the user’s personal view that considers only relevant features. An extensive experimental evaluation shows the approach’s effectiveness, considering the recommendation results’ accuracy, diversity, and induced bias. The public implementation of KGFlex is available at https://split.to/kgflex.</p>

    <h3>DataRec: A System for Finding Datasets Based on Scientific Problem Descriptions (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ann-Kathrin Leisinger, Michael Färber</p>
    <p>The number of datasets is steadily rising, making it increasingly difficult for researchers and practitioners in the various scientific disciplines to be aware of all datasets, particularly of the most relevant datasets for a given research problem. To this end, dataset search engines have been proposed. However, they are based on the users’ keywords and thus have difficulties in determining precisely fitting datasets for complex research problems. In this paper, we propose the system at http://data-hunter.io that recommends suitable datasets to users based on given research problem descriptions. It is based on fastText for the text representation and text classification, the Data Set Knowledge Graph (DSKG) with metadata about almost 1,700 unique datasets, as well as 88,000 paper abstracts as research problem descriptions for training the model. Overall, our system demonstrates that recommending datasets facilitates data provisioning and reuse according to the FAIR principles and that dataset recommendation is a promising future research direction.</p>

    <h3>Towards Multi-Language Recipe Personalisation and Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niall Twomey, Andrey Ponikar, Nadine Sarraf, Mikhail Fain</p>
    <p>Multi-language recipe personalisation and recommendation is an under-explored field of information retrieval in academic and production systems. The existing gaps in our current understanding are numerous, even on fundamental questions such as whether consistent and high-quality recipe recommendation can be delivered across languages. Motivated by this need, we consider the multi-language recipe recommendation setting and present grounding results that will help to establish the potential and absolute value of future work in this area. Our work draws on several billion events from millions of recipes, with published recipes and users incorporating several languages, including Arabic, English, Indonesian, Russian, and Spanish. We represent recipes using a combination of normalised ingredients, standardised skills and image embeddings obtained without human intervention. In modelling, we take a classical approach based on optimising an embedded bi-linear user-item metric space towards the interactions that most strongly elicit cooking intent. For users without interaction histories, a bespoke content-based cold-start model that predicts context and recipe affinity is introduced. We show that our approach to personalisation is stable and scales well to new languages. A robust cross-validation campaign is employed and consistently rejects baseline models and representations, strongly favouring those we propose. Our results are presented in a language-oriented (as opposed to model-oriented) fashion to emphasise the language-based goals of this work. We believe that this is the first large-scale work that evaluates the value and potential of multi-language recipe recommendation and personalisation.</p>

    <h3>A Ranking Optimization Approach to Latent Linear Critiquing in Conversational Recommender System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Scott Sanner, Kai Luo, Ga Wu, Hanze Li</p>
    <p>Critiquing is a method for conversational recommendation that incrementally adapts recommendations in response to user preference feedback. Specifically, a user is iteratively provided with item recommendations and attribute descriptions for those items; the user may then either accept the recommendation or choose to critique an attribute to generate a new recommendation. A recent direction known as latent linear critiquing (LLC) takes a modern embedding-based approach that seeks to optimize the combination of user preference embeddings with embeddings of critiques based on subjective item descriptions (i.e., keyphrases from user reviews); LLC does so by exploiting the linear structure of the embeddings to efficiently optimize their weights in a linear programming (LP) formulation. In this paper, we revisit LLC and note that it’s score-based optimization approach inherently encourages extreme weightings in order to maximize predicted score gaps between preferred and non-preferred items. Noting that the overall end task objective in critiquing is to re-rank rather than re-score, in this paper we take a ranking optimization approach that seeks to optimize embedding weights based on observed rank violations from earlier critiquing iterations. We evaluate the proposed framework on two recommendation datasets containing user reviews. Empirical results demonstrate that ranking-based LLC generally outperforms scoring-based LLC and other baselines across a variety of datasets, critiquing styles, and both satisfaction and session-length performance metrics.</p>

    <h3>Balancing relevance and discovery to inspire customers in the IKEA App (2020)</h3>

    <p>IKEA stores are designed to engage and inspire customers as they make their way from the entrance to check-out. To enable a great experience for every individual, our home-furnishing experts strive to provide the best possible input and advice, catering to individual needs and helping customers realise their vision for life at home.<br>As we move rapidly towards a multi touch point shopping vision with digital at heart, data and machine learning are crucial to 1) enable a consistent journey across, and 2) extend the domain expertise found in stores to our purely digital touch points, like the new IKEA App. A specific example of a digital product where we aim to inspire is our newly launched Inspirational Feed. In the Feed, customers browse their way through ”shoppable” images, in which our products are displayed in purposefully atmospheric settings for a wide range of room types. In this talk, we present our newest algorithmic approach to personalise the Feed based on contextual bandits [2, 3, 4], and highlight some of the technical challenges regarding implementation at scale.<br>The past decade has led to an explosion in research on recommender systems, often with personalised content as a motivating factor [1]. To identify a suitable class of algorithmic strategies for the Feed, note that: To capture the described trade-off between relevance and discovery, as well as matching data for how customers on average shop with IKEA, contextual bandits with batch learning from logged bandit feedback inspired by [4] have shown especially promising results among numerous other exploitation-exploration strategies. This approach induces a fair amount of exploration and minimizes the risk of showing irrelevant images to the customer based on the principle of counterfactual risk minimisation. In our contextual bandit setup, a bandit session is defined as a user session of the Feed taking place in the App (the home of the Feed). An action is displaying an image, while a reward is generated whenever the user clicks on it. The bandit context consists of previous user behaviour collected from the App, combined with product metadata. Our model takes advantage of embeddings of the input features, similar to [1].<br>The implementation of the strategy requires us to handle several interesting edge cases, e.g. we are looking into various techniques for increasing exploration as new images are added to our dynamic content catalogue.</p>

Our results show that for recommending similar jobs, we achieve the best online performance in terms of Click-Through Rate when we employ embeddings based on the most recent interaction.

    <h3>Learning Consumer and Producer Embeddings for User-Generated Content Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian McAuley, Wang-Cheng Kang</p>
    <p>User-Generated Content (UGC) is at the core of web applications where users can both produce and consume content. This differs from traditional e-Commerce domains where content producers and consumers are usually from two separate groups. In this work, we propose a method CPRec (consumer and producer based recommendation), for recommending content on UGC-based platforms. Specifically, we learn a core embedding for each user and two transformation matrices to project the user’s core embedding into two ‘role’ embeddings (i.e., a producer and consumer role). We model each interaction by the ternary relation between the consumer, the consumed item, and its producer. Empirical studies on two large-scale UGC applications show that our method outperforms standard collaborative filtering methods as well as recent methods that model producer information via item features.</p>

    <p>We propose Meta-Prod2vec, a novel method to compute item similarities for recommendation that leverages existing item metadata. Such scenarios are frequently encountered in applications such as content recommendation, ad targeting and web search. Our method leverages past user interactions with items and their attributes to compute low-dimensional embeddings of items. Specifically, the item metadata is in- jected into the model as side information to regularize the item embeddings. We show that the new item representa- tions lead to better performance on recommendation tasks on an open music dataset.</p>
