    <h3>Progressive Horizon Learning: Adaptive Long Term Optimization for Personalized Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Ni, Shreya Chakrabarti, Congrui Yi, David Zumwalt</p>
    <p>As B2C companies such as Amazon, Netflix, Spotify scale, personalized recommender systems are often needed to further drive long term business growth in acquisition, engagement, and retention of customers. However, long-term metrics associated with these goals can require several months to mature. Additionally, deep personalization also demands a large volume of training data that take a long time to collect. These factors incur substantial lead time for training a model to optimize a long-term metric. Before such model is deployed, a recommender system has to rely on a simple policy (e.g. random) to collect customer feedback data for training, inflicting high opportunity cost and delaying optimization of the target metric. Besides, as customer preferences can shift over time, a large temporal gap between inputs and outcome poses a high risk of data staleness and suboptimal learning. Existing approaches involve various compromises. For instance, contextual bandits often optimize short-term surrogate metrics with simple model structure, which can be suboptimal in the long run, while Reinforcement Learning approaches rely on an abundance of historical data for offline training, which essentially means long lead time before deployment. To address these problems, we propose Progressive Horizon Learning Recommender (PHLRec), a personalized model that can progressively learn metric patterns and adaptively evolve from short- to long-term optimization over time. Through simulations and real data experiments, we demonstrated that PHLRec outperforms competing methods, achieving optimality in both deployment speed and long-term metric performances.</p>

    <h3>In-Store Augmented Reality-Enabled Product Comparison and Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jürgen Ziegler, Jesús Omar Álvarez Márquez</p>
    <p>We present an approach combining the AR-based presentation of product attributes in a physical retail store with recommendations for items only available online. The system supports users’ decision-making process by offering functions for comparing product features between items, both physical and online, and by providing recommendations based on selecting in-store products. The physical products may thus serve as anchors for forming the user’s preferences, also offering a richer and more engaging experience when exploring the products hands-on. Both objective product attributes as well as the visual appearance of a physical product are employed for generating recommendations from the online space. In this way, the advantages of online and in-store shopping can be combined, creating novel multi-channel opportunities for businesses. An empirical evaluation showed that the comparison and recommendation functions were appreciated by users, and hinted some possible benefits of a hybrid physical-online shopping support system. Despite the limitations of the study, there is sufficient evidence to consider this a viable approach worth to be further explored.</p>

    <h3>Recommender Systems for Product Bundling (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lior Rokach, Moran Beladev, Bracha Shapira</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RSs) enhance e-commerce sales by recommending relevant products to their customers. RSs aim at implementing the firm’s web-based marketing strategy to increase revenues. Generating bundles is an example of a marketing strategy that aims to satisfy consumer needs and preferences, and at the same time, to increase customers’ buying scope and the firm’s income. Thus, finding and recommending an optimal and personal bundle becomes very important. In this paper we introduce a novel model of bundle recommendations that integrates collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, personalized demand functions, and price modeling. This model provides a recommendation list by finding pairs of products that maximizes both, the probability of their purchase by the user and the revenue received by selling this bundles.</p>
