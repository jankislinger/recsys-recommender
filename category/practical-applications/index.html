    <h3>Entity-Aware Collections Ranking: A Joint Scoring Approach (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youhe Chen, Sihao Chen, Sheng Li, Dong Yang</p>
    <p>Recommender systems in academia and industry typically predict Click-Through Rate (CTR) at the item or entity level. In practical scenarios, products can take on various forms and designs. We present a novel joint scoring framework that supports the listwise ranking of a collection composed of multiple entities. It learns the best combination of entities to be displayed to the user. We also introduce a novel dual attention mechanism that better captures the user’s interest in the collection. Our approach demonstrated superior performance through offline and online experiments and has been deployed to Shopee’s Shop Ads across all markets.</p>

    <h3>Generative Learning Plan Recommendation for Employees: A Performance-aware Reinforcement Learning Approach (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying Sun, Xin Song, Hengshu Zhu, Hui Xiong, Zhi Zheng</p>
    <p>With the rapid development of enterprise Learning Management Systems (LMS), more and more companies are trying to build enterprise training and course learning platforms for promoting the career development of employees. Indeed, through course learning, many employees have the opportunity to improve their knowledge and skills. For these systems, a major issue is how to recommend learning plans, i.e., a set of courses arranged in the order they should be learned, that can help employees improve their work performance. Existing studies mainly focus on recommending courses that users are most likely to click on by capturing their learning preferences. However, the learning preference of employees may not be the right fit for their career development, and thus it may not necessarily mean their work performance can be improved accordingly. Furthermore, how to capture the mutual correlation and sequential effects between courses, and ensure the rationality of the generated results, is also a major challenge. To this end, in this paper, we propose the Generative Learning plAn recommenDation (GLAD) framework, which can generate personalized learning plans for employees to help them improve their work performance. Specifically, we first design a performance predictor and a rationality discriminator, which have the same transformer-based model architecture, but with totally different parameters and functionalities. In particular, the performance predictor is trained for predicting the work performance of employees based on their work profiles and historical learning records, while the rationality discriminator aims to evaluate the rationality of the generated results. Then, we design a learning plan generator based on the gated transformer and the cross-attention mechanism for learning plan generation. We calculate the weighted sum of the output from the performance predictor and the rationality discriminator as the reward, and we use Self-Critical Sequence Training (SCST) based policy gradient methods to train the generator following the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) paradigm. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world data clearly validate the effectiveness of our GLAD framework compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods and reveal some interesting findings for talent management</p>

    <h3>Gradient Matching for Categorical Data Distillation in CTR Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixuan Li, Zhenhua Dong, Jiacheng Sun, Cheng Wang, Rui Zhang</p>
    <p>The cost of hardware and energy consumption on training a click-through rate (CTR) model is highly prohibitive. A recent promising direction for reducing such costs is data distillation with gradient matching, which aims to synthesize a small distilled dataset to guide the model to a similar parameter space as those trained on real data. However, there are two main challenges to implementing such a method in the recommendation field: (1) The categorical recommended data are high dimensional and sparse one- or multi-hot data which will block the gradient flow, causing backpropagation-based data distillation invalid. (2) The data distillation process with gradient matching is computationally expensive due to the bi-level optimization. To this end, we investigate efficient data distillation tailored for recommendation data with plenty of side information where we formulate the discrete data to the dense and continuous data format. Then, we further introduce a one-step gradient matching scheme, which performs gradient matching for only a single step to overcome the inefficient training process. The overall proposed method is called Categorical data distillation with Gradient Matching (CGM), which is capable of distilling a large dataset into a small of informative synthetic data for training CTR models from scratch. Experimental results show that our proposed method not only outperforms the state-of-the-art coreset selection and data distillation methods but also has remarkable cross-architecture performance. Moreover, we explore the application of CGM on continual updating and mitigate the effect of different random seeds on the training results.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation Systems for Ad Creation: A View from the Trenches (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manisha Verma, Shaunak Mishra</p>
    <p>Creative design is one of the key components of generating engaging content on the web. E-commerce websites need engaging product descriptions, social networks require user posts to have different types of content such as videos, images and hashtags, and traditional media formats such as blogs require content creators to constantly innovate their writing style, and choice of content they publish to engage with their intended audience. Designing the right content, irrespective of the industry, is a time consuming task, often requires several iterations of content selection and modification. Advertising is one such industry where content is the key to capture user interest and generate revenue. Designing engaging and attention grabbing advertisements requires extensive domain knowledge and market trend awareness. This motivates companies to hire marketing specialists to design specific advertising content, most often tasked to create text, image or video advertisements. This process is tedious and iterative which limits the amount of content that can be produced manually. In this talk, we summarize our work focused on automating ad creative design by leveraging state of the art approaches in text mining, ranking, generation, multimodal (visual-linguistic) representations, multilingual text understanding, and recommendation. We discuss how such approaches can help to reduce the time spent on designing ads, and showcase their impact on real world advertising systems and metrics.</p>

    <h3>Sequence Adaptation via Reinforcement Learning in Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefanos Antaris, Dimitrios Rafailidis</p>
    <p>Accounting for the fact that users have different sequential patterns, the main drawback of state-of-the-art recommendation strategies is that a fixed sequence length of user-item interactions is required as input to train the models. This might limit the recommendation accuracy, as in practice users follow different trends on the sequential recommendations. Hence, baseline strategies might ignore important sequential interactions or add noise to the models with redundant interactions, depending on the variety of users’ sequential behaviours. To overcome this problem, in this study we propose the SAR model, which not only learns the sequential patterns but also adjusts the sequence length of user-item interactions in a personalized manner. We first design an actor-critic framework, where the RL agent tries to compute the optimal sequence length as an action, given the user’s state representation at a certain time step. In addition, we optimize a joint loss function to align the accuracy of the sequential recommendations with the expected cumulative rewards of the critic network, while at the same time we adapt the sequence length with the actor network in a personalized manner. Our experimental evaluation on four real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of our proposed model over several baseline approaches. Finally, we make our implementation publicly available at https://github.com/stefanosantaris/sar.</p>

    <h3>Debiasing Item-to-Item Recommendations With Small Annotated Datasets (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Schnabel, Paul N. Bennett</p>
    <p>Item-to-item recommendation (e.g., “People who like this also like...”) is a ubiquitous and important type of recommendation in real-world systems. Observational data from historical interaction logs abound in these settings. However, since virtually all observational data exhibit biases, such as time-in-inventory or interface biases, it is crucial that recommender algorithms account for these biases. In this paper, we develop a principled approach for item-to-item recommendation based on causal inference and present a practical and highly effective method for estimating the causal parameters from a small annotated dataset. Empirically, we find that our approach substantially improves upon existing methods while requiring only small amounts of annotated data.</p>

    <h3>BETA-Rec: Build, Evaluate and Tune Automated Recommender Systems (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iadh Ounis, Yaxiong Wu, Shangsong Liang, Zaiqiao Meng, Craig Macdonald, Guangtao Zeng, Richard McCreadie, Siwei Liu, Yucheng Liang, Qiang Zhang, Junhua Liang</p>
    <p>The field of recommender systems has rapidly evolved over the last few years, with significant advances made due to the in-flux of deep learning techniques. However, as a result of this rapid progress, escalating barriers-to-entry for new researchers is emerging. In particular, state-of-the-art approaches have fragmented into a large number of code-bases, often requiring different input formats, pre-processing stages and evaluating with different metric packages. Hence, it is time-consuming for new researchers to reach the point of having both an effective baseline set and a sound comparative environment. As a step towards elevating this problem, we have developed BETA-Rec, an open source project for Building, Evaluating and Tuning Automated Recommender Systems. BETA-Rec aims to provide a practical data toolkit for building end-to-end recommendation systems in a standardized way. It provides means for dataset preparation and splitting using common strategies, a generalized model engine for implementing recommender models using Pytorch with 9 models available out-of-the-box, as well as a unified training, validation, tuning and testing pipeline. Furthermore, BETA-Rec is designed to be both modular and extensible, enabling new models to be quickly added to the framework. It is deployable in a wide range of environments via pre-built docker containers and supports distributed parameter tuning using Ray. In this demo, we will illustrate the deployment and use of BETA-Rec for researchers and practitioners on a number of standard recommendation datasets. The source code of the project is available at github: https://github.com/beta-team/beta-recsys.</p>

    <h3>Making the Most of Preference Feedback by Modeling Feature Dependencies (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sutanu Chakraborty, S Chandra Mouli</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems help users navigate through the product space by exploiting feedback. In conversational systems based on preference-based feedback, the user selects the most preferred item from a list of recommended products. Modelling user’s preferences then becomes important in order to recommend relevant items. Several existing recommender systems accomplish this by assuming the features to be independent. Here we will attempt to forego this assumption and exploit the dependencies between the features to build a robust user preference model.</p>

    <h3>Ensemble Contextual Bandits for Personalized Recommendation (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Li, Lei Li, Yexi Jiang, Liang Tang</p>
    <p>The cold-start problem has attracted extensive attention among various online services that provide personalized recommendation. Many online vendors employ contextual bandit strategies to tackle the so-called exploration/exploitation dilemma rooted from the cold-start problem. However, due to high-dimensional user/item features and the underlying characteristics of bandit policies, it is often difficult for service providers to obtain and deploy an appropriate algorithm to achieve acceptable and robust economic profit. In this paper, we explore ensemble strategies of multiple contextual bandit algorithms to obtain robust predicted click-through rate (CTR) of web objects. Specifically, the ensemble is acquired by aggregating different pulling policies of bandit algorithms, rather than forcing the agreement of prediction results or learning a unified predictive model. To this end, we employ a meta-bandit paradigm that places a hyper bandit over the base bandits, to explicitly explore/exploit the relative importance of base bandits based on user feedbacks. Extensive empirical experiments on two real-world data sets (news recommendation and online advertising) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of CTR.</p>
