    <h3>Putting Popularity Bias Mitigation to the Test: A User-Centric Evaluation in Music Recommenders (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Ungruh, Karlijn Dinnissen, Maria Soledad Pera, Hanna Hauptmann, Anja Volk</p>
    <p>Popularity bias is a prominent phenomenon in recommender systems (RS), especially in the music domain. Although popularity bias mitigation techniques are known to enhance the fairness of RS while maintaining their high performance, there is a lack of understanding regarding users’ actual perception of the suggested music. To address this gap, we conducted a user study (n=40) exploring user satisfaction and perception of personalized music recommendations generated by algorithms that explicitly mitigate popularity bias. Specifically, we investigate item-centered and user-centered bias mitigation techniques, aiming to ensure fairness for artists or users, respectively. Results show that neither mitigation technique harms the users’ satisfaction with the recommendation lists despite promoting underrepresented items. However, the item-centered mitigation technique impacts user perception; by promoting less popular items, it reduces users’ familiarity with the items. Lower familiarity evokes discovery—the feeling that the recommendations enrich the user’s taste. We demonstrate that this  can ultimately lead to higher satisfaction, highlighting the potential of less-popular recommendations to improve the user experience.</p>

    <h3>Explainability in Music Recommender System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahrzad Shashaani</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems play a crucial role in our daily lives, influencing many of our significant and minor decisions. These systems also have become integral to the music industry, guiding users to discover new content based on their tastes. However, the lack of transparency in these systems often leaves users questioning the rationale behind recommendations. To address this issue, adding transparency and explainability to recommender systems is a promising solution. Enhancing the explainability of these systems can significantly improve user trust and satisfaction. This research focuses on exploring transparency and explainability in the context of recommendation systems, focusing on the music domain. This research can help to understand the gaps in explainability in music recommender systems to create more engaging and trustworthy music recommendations.</p>

    <h3>On the Consistency of Average Embeddings for Item Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Romain Hennequin, Thomas Bouabça, Guillaume Salha-Galvan, Walid Bendada, Tristan Cazenave</p>
    <p>A prevalent practice in recommender systems consists of averaging item embeddings to represent users or higher-level concepts in the same embedding space. This paper investigates the relevance of such a practice. For this purpose, we propose an expected precision score, designed to measure the consistency of an average embedding relative to the items used for its construction. We subsequently analyze the mathematical expression of this score in a theoretical setting with specific assumptions, as well as its empirical behavior on real-world data from music streaming services. Our results emphasize that real-world averages are less consistent for recommendation, which paves the way for future research to better align real-world embeddings with assumptions from our theoretical setting.</p>

    <h3>Station and Track Attribute-Aware Music Personalization (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Jeffrey Mei, Oliver Bembom, Andreas Ehmann</p>
    <p>We present a transformer for music personalization that recommends tracks given a station seed (artist) and improves the accuracy vs. a baseline matrix factorization method by 10%. Adding more embeddings to capture track and station attributes further improves the accuracy of our recommendations, and also improves recommendation diversity, i.e. mitigates popularity bias. We analyze the learned embeddings and find they learn both explicit attributes provided at training and implicit attributes that may inform listener preferences. We also find that unlike matrix factorization, our model can identify and transfer relevant listener preferences across different genres and artists.</p>

    <h3>A User-Centered Investigation of Personal Music Tours (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Gabbolini, Derek Bridge</p>
    <p>Streaming services use recommender systems to surface the right music to users. Playlists are a popular way to present music in a list-like fashion, i.e. as a plain list of songs. An alternative are tours, where the songs alternate with segues, which explain the connections between consecutive songs. Tours address the user need of seeking background information about songs, and are found to be superior to playlists, given the right user context. In this work, we provide, for the first time, a user-centered evaluation of two tour-generation algorithms (Greedy and Optimal) using semi-structured interviews. We assess the algorithms, we discuss attributes of the tours that the algorithms produce, we identify which attributes are desirable and which are not, and we enumerate several possible improvements to the algorithms, along with practical suggestions on how to implement the improvements. Our main findings are that Greedy generates more likeable tours than Optimal, and that three important attributes of tours are segue diversity, song arrangement and song familiarity. More generally, we provide insights into how to present music to users, which could inform the design of user-centered recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Predicting Music Relistening Behavior Using the ACT-R Framework (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elham Motamedi, Marko Tkalcic, Markus Reiter-Haas, Emilia Parada-Cabaleiro, Elisabeth Lex, Markus Schedl</p>
    <p>Providing suitable recommendations is of vital importance to improve the user satisfaction of music recommender systems. Here, users often listen to the same track repeatedly and appreciate recommendations of the same song multiple times. Thus, accounting for users’ relistening behavior is critical for music recommender systems. In this paper, we describe a psychology-informed approach to model and predict music relistening behavior that is inspired by studies in music psychology, which relate music preferences to human memory. We adopt a well-established psychological theory of human cognition that models the operations of human memory, i.e., Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational (ACT-R). In contrast to prior work, which uses only the base-level component of ACT-R, we utilize five components of ACT-R, i.e., base-level, spreading, partial matching, valuation, and noise, to investigate the effect of five factors on music relistening behavior: (i) recency and frequency of prior exposure to tracks, (ii) co-occurrence of tracks, (iii) the similarity between tracks, (iv) familiarity with tracks, and (v) randomness in behavior. On a dataset of 1.7 million listening events from Last.fm, we evaluate the performance of our approach by sequentially predicting the next track(s) in user sessions. We find that recency and frequency of prior exposure to tracks is an effective predictor of relistening behavior. Besides, considering the co-occurrence of tracks and familiarity with tracks further improves performance in terms of R-precision. We hope that our work inspires future research on the merits of considering cognitive aspects of memory retrieval to model and predict complex user behavior.</p>

    <h3>Leveraging Post-click Feedback for Content Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongyi Wen, Longqi Yang, Deborah Estrin</p>
    <p>Implicit feedback (e.g., clicks) is widely used in content recommendations. However, clicks only reflect user preferences according to their first impressions. They do not capture the extent to which users continue to engage with the content. Our analysis shows that more than half of the clicks on music and short videos are followed by skips from two real-world datasets. In this paper, we leverage post-click feedback, e.g. skips and completions, to improve the training and evaluation of content recommenders. Specifically, we experiment with existing collaborative filtering algorithms and find that they perform poorly against post-click-aware ranking metrics. Based on these insights, we develop a generic probabilistic framework to fuse click and post-click signals. We show how our framework can be applied to improve pointwise and pairwise recommendation models. Our approach is shown to outperform existing methods by 18.3% and 2.5% respectively in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) on the short-video and music dataset. We discuss the effectiveness of our approach across content domains and trade-offs in weighting various user feedback signals.</p>

    <h3>Online Learning to Rank for Sequential Music Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Ueda, Nivio Ziviani, Bruno L. Pereira, Gustavo Penha, Rodrygo L. T. Santos</p>
    <p>The prominent success of music streaming services has brought increasingly complex challenges for music recommendation. In particular, in a streaming setting, songs are consumed sequentially within a listening session, which should cater not only for the user’s historical preferences, but also for eventual preference drifts, triggered by a sudden change in the user’s context. In this paper, we propose a novel online learning to rank approach for music recommendation aimed to continuously learn from the user’s listening feedback. In contrast to existing online learning approaches for music recommendation, we leverage implicit feedback as the only signal of the user’s preference. Moreover, to adapt rapidly to preference drifts over millions of songs, we represent each song in a lower dimensional feature space and explore multiple directions in this space as duels of candidate recommendation models. Our thorough evaluation using listening sessions from Last.fm demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach at learning faster and better compared to state-of-the-art online learning approaches.</p>

    <h3>Content-based Feature Exploration for Transparent Music Recommendation using Self-attentive Genre Classification (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juheon Lee, Kyogu Lee, Seungjin Lee</p>
    <p>Interpretation of retrieved results is an important issue in music recommender systems, particularly from a user perspective. In this study, we investigate the methods for providing interpretability of content features using self-attention. We extract lyric features with the self-attentive genre classification model trained on 140,000 tracks of lyrics. Likewise, we extract acoustic features using the acoustic model with self-attention trained on 120,000 tracks of acoustic signals. The experimental results show that the proposed methods provide the characteristics that are interpretable in terms of both lyrical and musical contents. We demonstrate this by visualizing the attention weights, and by presenting the most similar songs found using lyric or audio features.</p>

    <h3>Representation Learning for Image-based Music Recommendation (2018)</h3>

    <p>Image perception is one of the most direct ways to provide contextual information about a user concerning his/her surrounding environment; hence images are a suitable proxy for contextual recommendation. We propose a novel representation learning framework for image-based music recommendation that bridges the heterogeneity gap between music and image data; the proposed method is a key component for various contextual recommendation tasks. Preliminary experiments show that for an image-to-song retrieval task, the proposed method retrieves relevant or conceptually similar songs for input images.</p>

    <h3>Acquisition of Music Pairwise Scores and Facial Expressions (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matija Marolt, Nima Maleki, Matevž Pesek, Mehdi Elahi, Marko Tkalcic, Francesco Ricci</p>
    <p>We present a research tool for user preference elicitation that collects both explicit user feedback and unobtrusively acquired facial expressions. The concrete implementation is a web-based user interface where the user is presented with two music excerpts. After listening to both, the user provides a pairwise score (i.e. which of the two items is preferred) for each pair of music excerpts. The novelty of the demo is the integration of the unobtrusive acquisition of facial expressions through the webcam. During the listening of the music excerpts, the system extracts features related to the facial expressions of the user several times per second. The interaction runs as a web application, which allows for a large-scale remote acquisition of emotional data. Up to now, such acquisitions were usually done in controlled environments with few subjects, hence being of little use for the recommender systems community.</p>

    <h3>Query-based Music Recommendations via Preference Embedding (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming-Feng Tsai, Yu-Ching Lin, Yi-Hsuan Yang, Chih-Ming Chen</p>
    <p>A common scenario considered in recommender systems is to predict a user’s preferences on unseen items based on his/her preferences on observed items. A major limitation of this scenario is that a user might be interested in different things each time when using the system, but there is no way to allow the user to actively alter or adjust the recommended results. To address this issue, we propose the idea of “query-based recommendation” that allows a user to specify his/her search intention while exploring new items, thereby incorporating the concept of information retrieval into recommendation systems. Moreover, the idea is more desirable when the user intention can be expressed in different ways. Take music recommendation as an example: the proposed system allows a user to explore new song tracks by specifying either a track, an album, or an artist. To enable such heterogeneous queries in a recommender system, we present a novel technique called “Heterogeneous Preference Embedding” to encode user preference and query intention into low-dimensional vector spaces. Then, with simple search methods or similarity calculations, we can use the encoded representation of queries to generate recommendations. This method is fairly flexible and it is easy to add other types of information when available. Evaluations on three music listening datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art matrix factorization and network embedding methods.</p>

    <h3>Modeling the Dynamics of User Preferences in Coupled Tensor Factorization (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandros Nanopoulos, Dimitrios Rafailidis</p>
    <p>In several applications, user preferences can be fairly dynamic, since users tend to exploit a wide range of items and modify their tastes accordingly over time. In this paper, we model continuous user-item interactions over time using a tensor that has time as a dimension (mode). To account for the fact that user preferences are dynamic and change individually, we propose a new measure of user-preference dynamics (UPD) that captures the rate with which the current preferences of each user have been shifted. We generate recommendations based on factorizing the tensor, by weighting the importance of past user preferences according to their UPD values. We additionally exploit users’ side data, such as demographics, which can help improving the accuracy of recommendations based on a coupled, tensor-matrix factorization scheme. Our empirical evaluation uses a real data set from last.fm, which allows us to demonstrate that user preferences can become very dynamic. Our experimental results show that the proposed method, by taking into account these dynamics, outperforms several baselines.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Temporal Influence in Online Recommendation (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Palovics, Tamas Kiss, Andras Benczur, Erzsebet Frigo, Levente Kocsis</p>
    <p>In this paper we give methods for time aware music recommendation in a social media service with the potential of exploiting immediate temporal influences between users. We consider events when a user listens to an artist the first time and this event follows some friend listening to the same artist short time before. We train a blend of matrix factorization methods that model the relation of the influencer, the influenced and the artist, both the individual factor decompositions and their weight learned by variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Special care is taken since events of influence form a subset of the positive implicit feedback data and hence we have to cope with two different definitions of the positive and negative implicit training data. In addition, in the time aware setting we have to use online learning and evaluation methods. While SGD can easily be trained online, evaluation is cumbersome by traditional measures since we will have potentially different top recommendations at different times. Our experiments are carried over the two-year scrobble history of 70,000 Last.fm users and show a 4% increase in recommendation quality by predicting temporal influences.</p>
