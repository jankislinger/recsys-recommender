    <h3>Less is More: Towards Sustainability-Aware Persuasive Explanations in Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seda Polat Erdeniz, Viet-Man Le, Sebastian Lubos, Alexander Felfernig, Merfat El Mansi, Thi Ngoc Trang Tran</p>
    <p>Recommender systems play an important role in supporting the achievement of the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs). In recommender systems, explanations can support different goals, such as increasing a user’s trust in a recommendation, persuading a user to purchase specific items, or increasing the understanding of the reasons behind a recommendation. In this paper, we discuss the concept of “sustainability-aware persuasive explanations” which we regard as a major concept to support the achievement of the mentioned SDGs. Such explanations are orthogonal to most existing explanation approaches since they focus on a “less is more” principle, which per se is not included in existing e-commerce platforms. Based on a user study in three item domains, we analyze the potential impacts of sustainability-aware persuasive explanations. The study results are promising regarding user acceptance and the potential impacts of such explanations.</p>

    <h3>Explainability in Music Recommender System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahrzad Shashaani</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems play a crucial role in our daily lives, influencing many of our significant and minor decisions. These systems also have become integral to the music industry, guiding users to discover new content based on their tastes. However, the lack of transparency in these systems often leaves users questioning the rationale behind recommendations. To address this issue, adding transparency and explainability to recommender systems is a promising solution. Enhancing the explainability of these systems can significantly improve user trust and satisfaction. This research focuses on exploring transparency and explainability in the context of recommendation systems, focusing on the music domain. This research can help to understand the gaps in explainability in music recommender systems to create more engaging and trustworthy music recommendations.</p>

    <h3>GenUI(ne) CRS: UI Elements and Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Conversational Recommender Systems with LLMs (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lien Michiels, Annelien Smets, Ulysse Maes</p>
    <p>Previous research has used Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop personalized Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) with text-based user interfaces (UIs). However, the potential of LLMs to generate interactive graphical elements that enhance user experience remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce “GenUI(ne) CRS,” a novel framework designed to leverage LLMs for adaptive and interactive UIs. Our framework supports domain-specific graphical elements such as buttons and cards, in addition to text-based inputs. It also addresses the common LLM issue of outdated knowledge, known as the “knowledge cut-off,” by implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To illustrate its potential, we developed a prototype movie CRS. This work demonstrates the feasibility of LLM-powered interactive UIs and paves the way for future CRS research, including user experience validation, transparent explanations, and addressing LLM biases.</p>

    <h3>Demystifying Recommender Systems: A Multi-faceted Examination of Explanation Generation, Impact, and Perception (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Balloccu</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have become an integral component of the digital landscape, impacting a multitude of services and industries ranging from e-commerce to entertainment and beyond. By offering personalised suggestions, these systems challenge a fundamental problem in our modern information society named information overload. As users face a deluge of choices, recommender systems help sift through this immense sea of possibilities, delivering a personalised subset of options that align with user preferences and historical behaviour. However, despite their considerable utility, recommender systems often operate as “black boxes,” obscuring the rationale behind recommendations. This opacity can engender mistrust and undermine user engagement, thus attenuating the overall effectiveness of the system. Researchers have emphasized the importance of explanations in recommender systems, highlighting how explanations can enhance system transparency, foster user trust, and improve decision-making processes, thereby enriching user experiences and yielding potential business benefits. Yet, a significant gap persists in the current state of human-understandable explanations research. While recommender systems have grown increasingly complex, our capacity to generate clear, concise, and relevant explanations that reflect this complexity remains limited. Crafting explanations that are both understandable and reflective of sophisticated algorithmic decision-making processes poses a significant challenge, especially in a manner that meets the user’s cognitive and contextual needs.</p>

    <h3>Reducing Energy Waste in Households Through Real-Time Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iraklis Varlamis, Akshay Anil Pagar, Janhavi Dahihande, Ajinkya Thakare, Magdalini Eirinaki, Akshay Anil Jaiswal</p>
    <p>The energy consumption of households has steadily increased over the last couple of decades. Research suggests that user behavior is the most influential factor in the energy waste of a household. Thus, there’s a need for helping consumers change their behavior to make it more energy efficient and environment friendly. In this work we propose a real-time recommender system that assists consumers in improving their household’s energy usage. By monitoring the power demand of each appliance in the household, the system detects the device status (on/off) at any moment, and using pattern mining creates a household profile comprising energy consumption patterns for different periods of the day. An intuitive UI allows users to set energy consumption goals and preferences on the appliances they’d like to save energy from. Based on the household profile, the user’s preferences and the actual power demand the system generates personalized real-time recommendations on which appliances should be turned off at a moment. We employ the UK-DALE (UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity) dataset to model and evaluate the entire process, from data preprocessing and transformation of the appliance power demand input to various pattern mining algorithms used to generate appliance usage profiles and recommendations, showing that even small changes in appliance usage behavior can lead to energy savings between 2-17%.</p>

    <h3>IRF: Interactive Recommendation through Dialogue (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oznur Alkan, Massimiliano Mattetti, Elizabeth M. Daly, Inge Vejsbjerg, Adi Botea</p>
    <p>Recent research focuses beyond recommendation accuracy, towards human factors that influence the acceptance of recommendations, such as user satisfaction, trust, transparency and sense of control. We present a generic interactive recommender framework that can add interaction functionalities to non-interactive recommender systems. We take advantage of dialogue systems to interact with the user and we design a middleware layer to provide the interaction functions, such as providing explanations for the recommendations, managing users' preferences learnt from dialogue, preference elicitation and refining recommendations based on learnt preferences.</p>

    <h3>With a little help from my friends: use of recommendations at school (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theo Huibers, Emiliana Murgia, Maria Soledad Pera, Monica Landoni</p>
    <p>In this exploratory paper, we study the usage of recommendations by and for children (ages 9 to 11) in an educational setting. From our preliminary analysis, it becomes apparent that recommender systems (RS) could provide extra support to and help children successfully complete inquiry tasks. Nonetheless, children have difficulty in recognizing the role of RS, in terms of aiding information discovery for classroom assignments. Findings from our study set a foundation that can inform future design and development of RS for children that support classroom-related work.</p>

    <h3>EXTRA: Explaining Team Recommendation in Networks (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nan Cao, Qinghai Zhou, Hanghang Tong, Norbou Buchler, Liangyue Li</p>
    <p>State-of-the-art in network science of teams offers effective recommendation methods to answer questions like who is the best replacement, what is the best team expansion strategy, but lacks intuitive ways to explain why the optimization algorithm gives the specific recommendation for a given team optimization scenario. To tackle this problem, we develop an interactive prototype system, Extra, as the first step towards addressing such a sense-making challenge, through the lens of the underlying network where teams embed, to explain the team recommendation results. The main advantages are (1) Algorithm efficacy: we propose an effective and fast algorithm to explain random walk graph kernel, the central technique for networked team recommendation; (2) Intuitive visual explanation: we present intuitive visual analysis of the recommendation results, which can help users better understand the rationality of the underlying team recommendation algorithm.</p>

    <h3>Understanding User Interactions with Podcast Recommendations Delivered Via Voice (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longqi Yang, Christina Tsangouri, Deborah Estrin, Michael Sobolev</p>
    <p>Voice interfaces introduced by smart speakers present new opportunities and challenges for podcast content recommendations. Understanding how users interact with voice-based recommendations has the potential to inform better design of vocal recommenders. However, existing knowledge about user behavior is mostly for visual interfaces, such as the web, and is not directly transferable to voice interfaces, which rely on user listening and do not support skimming and browsing. To fill in the gap, in this paper, we conduct a controlled study to compare user interactions with recommendations delivered visually and vocally. Through an online A-B testing with 100 participants, we find that, when recommendations are vocally conveyed, users consume more slowly, explore less, and choose fewer long-tail items. The study also reveals the correlation between user choices and exploration via the voice interface. Our findings provide challenges to the design of voice interfaces, such as increasing the diversity of the top-ranked recommendations and designing better navigation mechanisms.</p>

    <p>In the Internet of Things, smart devices are connected to collect and to exchange data. In our vision, in the Internet of Talking Things, objects such as intelligent fridges will be able to communicate with humans to set up preferences and profiling options which allow a personalized usage of the object. In this paper, we present a recommender system implemented as a Telegram Bot, that can fit with the previous scenario. The system is a movie recommender which exploits the information available in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud for generating the recommendations and leading the conversation with the user. It can be easily seen as an intelligent component of a connected TV.</p>

    <p>Every day, we are confronted with an abundance of decisions that require us to choose from a seemingly endless number of choice options. Recommender systems are supposed to help us deal with this formidable task, but some scholars claim that these systems instead put us inside a “Filter Bubble” that severely limits our perspectives. This paper presents a new direction for recommender systems research with the main goal of supporting users in developing, exploring, and understanding their unique personal preferences.</p>

    <h3>‘I like to explore sometimes’: Adapting to Dynamic User Novelty Preferences (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vikas Kumar, Joseph A. Konstan, Loren Terveen, Paul Schrater, Komal Kapoor</p>
    <p>Studies have shown that the recommendation of unseen, novel or serendipitous items is crucial for a satisfying and engaging user experience. As a result, recent developments in recommendation research have increasingly focused towards introducing novelty in user recommendation lists. While, existing solutions aim to ﬁnd the right balance between the similarity and novelty of the recommended items, they largely ignore the user needs for novelty. In this paper, we show that there are large individual and temporal differences in the users’ novelty preferences. We develop a regression model to predict these dynamic novelty preferences of users using features derived from their past interactions. Finally, we describe an adaptive recommender, , that adapts to the user needs for novel items and show that the model achieves better recommendation performance on a metric that considers both novel and familiar items.</p>
