    <h3>Towards Robust Fairness-aware Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Yang, Zhining Liu, Zeyu Zhang, Chenyi Zhuang, Xu Chen</p>
    <p>Due to the progressive advancement of trustworthy machine learning algorithms, fairness in recommender systems is attracting increasing attention and is often considered from the perspective of users. Conventional fairness-aware recommendation models make the assumption that user preferences remain the same between the training set and the testing set. However, this assumption is disagreed with reality, where user preference can shift in the testing set due to the natural spatial or temporal heterogeneity. It is concerning that conventional fairness-aware models may be unaware of such distribution shifts, leading to a sharp decline in the model performance. To address the distribution shift problem, we propose a robust fairness-aware recommendation framework based on Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) technique. In specific, we assign learnable weights for each sample to approximate the distributions that leads to the worst-case model performance, and then optimize the fairness-aware recommendation model to improve the worst-case performance in terms of both fairness and recommendation accuracy. By iteratively updating the weights and the model parameter, our framework can be robust to unseen testing sets. To ease the learning difficulty of DRO, we use a hard clustering technique to reduce the number of learnable sample weights. To optimize our framework in a full differentiable manner, we soften the above clustering strategy. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments based on four real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework. For benefiting the research community, we have released our project at https://anonyrobfair.github.io/.</p>

    <h3>Developing a Human-Centered Framework for Transparency in Fairness-Aware Recommender Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jessie J. Smith</p>
    <p>Though recommender systems fundamentally rely on human input and feedback, human-centered research in the RecSys discipline is lacking. When recommender systems aim to treat users more fairly, misinterpreting user objectives could lead to unintentional harm, whether or not fairness is part of the aim. When users seek to understand recommender systems better, a lack of transparency could act as an obstacle for their trust and adoption of the platform. Human-centered machine learning seeks to design systems that understand their users, while simultaneously designing systems that the users can understand. In this work, I propose to explore the intersection of transparency and user-system understanding through three phases of research that will result in a Human-Centered Framework for Transparency in Fairness-Aware Recommender Systems.</p>

    <h3>Fairness-aware Recommendation with librec-auto (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Burke, Nasim Sonboli, Zijun Liu, Masoud Mansoury</p>
    <p>Comparative experimentation is important for studying reproducibility in recommender systems. This is particularly true in areas without well-established methodologies, such as fairness-aware recommendation. In this paper, we describe fairness-aware enhancements to our recommender systems experimentation tool librec-auto. These enhancements include metrics for various classes of fairness definitions, extension of the experimental model to support result re-ranking and a library of associated re-ranking algorithms, and additional support for experiment automation and reporting. The associated demo will help attendees move quickly to configuring and running their own experiments with librec-auto.</p>
