    <h3>Powerful A/B-Testing Metrics and Where to Find Them (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shubham Baweja, Aleksei Ustimenko, Neeti Pokharna, Olivier Jeunen</p>
    <p>Online controlled experiments, colloquially known as A/B-tests, are the bread and butter of real-world recommender system evaluation. Typically, end-users are randomly assigned some system variant, and a plethora of metrics are then tracked, collected, and aggregated throughout the experiment. A North Star metric (e.g. long-term growth or revenue) is used to assess which system variant should be deemed superior. As a result, most collected metrics are <i>supporting</i> in nature, and serve to either (i) provide an understanding of how the experiment impacts user experience, or (ii) allow for confident decision-making when the North Star metric moves insignificantly (i.e. a false negative or type-II error). The latter is not straightforward: suppose a treatment variant leads to fewer but longer sessions, with more views but fewer engagements; should this be considered a positive or negative outcome? The question then becomes: how do we assess a supporting metric’s utility when it comes to decision-making using A/B-testing?Online platforms typically run dozens of experiments at any given time. This provides a wealth of information about interventions and treatment effects that can be used to evaluate metrics’ utility for online evaluation. We propose to collect this information and leverage it to quantify type-I, type-II, and type-III errors for the metrics of interest, alongside a distribution of measurements of their statistical power (e.g. $z$-scores and $p$-values). We present results and insights from building this pipeline at scale for two large-scale short-video platforms: ShareChat and Moj; leveraging hundreds of past experiments to find online metrics with high statistical power.</p>

    <h3>Pessimistic Reward Models for Off-Policy Learning in Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Jeunen, Bart Goethals</p>
    <p>Methods for bandit learning from user interactions often require a model of the reward a certain context-action pair will yield – for example, the probability of a click on a recommendation. This common machine learning task is highly non-trivial, as the data-generating process for contexts and actions is often skewed by the recommender system itself. Indeed, when the deployed recommendation policy at data collection time does not pick its actions uniformly-at-random, this leads to a selection bias that can impede effective reward modelling. This in turn makes off-policy learning – the typical setup in industry – particularly challenging.<br>In this work, we propose and validate a general pessimistic reward modelling approach for off-policy learning in recommendation. Bayesian uncertainty estimates allow us to express scepticism about our own reward model, which can in turn be used to generate a conservative decision rule. We show how it alleviates a well-known decision making phenomenon known as the Optimiser’s Curse, and draw parallels with existing work on pessimistic policy learning. Leveraging the available closed-form expressions for both the posterior mean and variance when a ridge regressor models the reward, we show how to apply pessimism effectively and efficiently to an off-policy recommendation use-case. Empirical observations in a wide range of environments show that being conservative in decision-making leads to a significant and robust increase in recommendation performance. The merits of our approach are most outspoken in realistic settings with limited logging randomisation, limited training samples, and larger action spaces.</p>
