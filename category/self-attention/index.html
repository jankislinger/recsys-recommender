    <h3>Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendations with Hyperbolic Representations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatyana Matveeva, Evgeny Frolov, Ivan Oseledets, Leyla Mirvakhabova</p>
    <p>In recent years, self-attentive sequential learning models have surpassed conventional collaborative filtering techniques in next-item recommendation tasks. However, Euclidean geometry utilized in these models may not be optimal for capturing a complex structure of behavioral data. Building on recent advances in the application of hyperbolic geometry to collaborative filtering tasks, we propose a novel approach that leverages hyperbolic geometry in the sequential learning setting. Our approach replaces final output of the Euclidean models with a linear predictor in the non-linear hyperbolic space, which increases the representational capacity and improves recommendation quality.</p>

    <h3>Reusable Self-Attention Recommender Systems in Fashion Industry Applications (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marjan Celikik, Ana Peleteiro Ramallo, Jacek Wasilewski</p>
    <p>A large number of empirical studies on applying self-attention models in the domain of recommender systems are based on offline evaluation and metrics computed on standardized datasets. Moreover, many of them do not consider side information such as item and customer metadata although deep-learning recommenders live up to their full potential only when numerous features of heterogeneous type are included. Also, normally the model is used only for a single use case. Due to these shortcomings, even if relevant, previous works are not always representative of their actual effectiveness in real-world industry applications. In this talk, we contribute to bridging this gap by presenting live experimental results demonstrating improvements in user retention of up to 30%. Moreover, we share our learnings and challenges from building a re-usable and configurable recommender system for various applications from the fashion industry. In particular, we focus on fashion inspiration use-cases, such as outfit ranking, outfit recommendation and real-time personalized outfit generation.</p>

    <h3>Personalized Re-ranking for Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan Pei, Yi Zhang, Fei Sun, Yongfeng Zhang, Hanxiao Sun, Changhua Pei, Wenwu Ou, Jian Wu, Peng Jiang, Junfeng Ge, Xiao Lin</p>
    <p>Ranking is a core task in recommender systems, which aims at providing an ordered list of items to users. Typically, a ranking function is learned from the labeled dataset to optimize the global performance, which produces a ranking score for each individual item. However, it may be sub-optimal because the scoring function applies to each item individually and does not explicitly consider the mutual influence between items, as well as the differences of usersâ€™ preferences or intents. Therefore, we propose a personalized re-ranking model for recommender systems. The proposed re-ranking model can be easily deployed as a follow-up modular after any ranking algorithm, by directly using the existing ranking feature vectors. It directly optimizes the whole recommendation list by employing a transformer structure to efficiently encode the information of all items in the list. Specifically, the Transformer applies a self-attention mechanism that directly models the global relationships between any pair of items in the whole list. We confirm that the performance can be further improved by introducing pre-trained embedding to learn personalized encoding functions for different users. Experimental results on both offline benchmarks and real-world online e-commerce systems demonstrate the significant improvements of the proposed re-ranking model.</p>

    <h3>Content-based Feature Exploration for Transparent Music Recommendation using Self-attentive Genre Classification (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juheon Lee, Kyogu Lee, Seungjin Lee</p>
    <p>Interpretation of retrieved results is an important issue in music recommender systems, particularly from a user perspective. In this study, we investigate the methods for providing interpretability of content features using self-attention. We extract lyric features with the self-attentive genre classification model trained on 140,000 tracks of lyrics. Likewise, we extract acoustic features using the acoustic model with self-attention trained on 120,000 tracks of acoustic signals. The experimental results show that the proposed methods provide the characteristics that are interpretable in terms of both lyrical and musical contents. We demonstrate this by visualizing the attention weights, and by presenting the most similar songs found using lyric or audio features.</p>
