    <h3>CAPRI-FAIR: Integration of Multi-sided Fairness in Contextual POI Recommendation Framework (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yonchanok Khaokaew, Jeffrey Chan, Flora D. Salim, Francis Dela Cruz</p>
    <p>Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation, a form of context-aware recommendation, takes into account spatio-temporal constraints and contexts like distance, peak business hours, and previous user check-ins. Given the ability of these kinds of systems to influence not just the consumer’s travel experience, but also the POI’s business, it is important to consider fairness from multiple perspectives. Unfortunately, these systems tend to provide less accurate recommendations to inactive users, and less exposure to unpopular POIs. The goal of this paper is to develop a post-filter methodology that incorporates provider and consumer fairness factors into pre-existing recommendation models, to satisfy fairness metrics like item exposure, and performance metrics like precision and distance, making the system more sustainable to both consumers and providers. Experiments have shown that using a linear scoring model for provider fairness in re-scoring recommended items yields the best tradeoff between performance and long-tail exposure, in some cases without a significant decrease in precision. When attempting to address consumer fairness by recommending more popular POIs to inactive users, the result was an increase in precision for only some recommendation models and datasets. Finally, when considering the tradeoff between both parameters, the combinations that reached the Pareto front of consumer and provider fairness, unfortunately, achieved the lowest precision values. We find that the nature of this tradeoff depends heavily on the model and the dataset.</p>

    <h3>Full Index Deep Retrieval: End-to-End User and Item Structures for Cold-start and Long-tail Item Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Wu, Chong Wang, Shengjie Wang, Anran Xu, Zhenzhe Zheng, Zhen Gong, Lei Chen, Fan Wu</p>
    <p>End-to-end retrieval models, such as Tree-based Models (TDM) and Deep Retrieval (DR), have attracted a lot of attention, but they are flawed in cold-start and long-tail item recommendation scenarios. Specifically, DR learns a compact indexing structure, enabling efficient and accurate retrieval for large recommendation systems. However, it is discovered that DR largely fails on retrieving cold-start and long-tail items. This is because DR only utilizes user-item interaction data, which is rare and often noisy for cold-start and long-tail items. And the end-to-end retrieval models are unable to make use of the rich item content features. To address this issue while maintaining the efficiency of DR indexing structure, we propose Full Index Deep Retrieval (FIDR) that learns indices for the full corpus items, including cold-start and long-tail items.  In addition to the original structure in DR (called User Structure in FIDR) that learns with user-item interaction data (e.g., clicks), we add an Item Structure to embed items directly based on item content features (e.g., categories). With joint efforts of User Structure and Item Structure, FIDR makes cold-start items retrievable and also improves the recommendation quality of long-tail items. To our best knowledge, FIDR is the first to solve the cold-start and long-tail recommendation problem for the end-to-end retrieval models. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FIDR can effectively recommend cold-start and long-tail items and largely promote overall recommendation performance without sacrificing inference efficiency. According to the experiments, the recall of FIDR is improved by 8.8% ~ 11.9%, while the inference of FIDR is as efficient as DR.</p>

    <h3>Closed-Form Models for Collaborative Filtering with Side-Information (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Van Balen, Bart Goethals, Olivier Jeunen</p>
    <p>Recent work has shown that, despite their simplicity, item-based models optimised through ridge regression can attain highly competitive results on collaborative filtering tasks. As these models are analytically computable and thus forgo the need for often expensive iterative optimisation procedures, they are an attractive choice for practitioners. We study the applicability of such closed-form models to implicit-feedback collaborative filtering when additional side-information or metadata about items is available. Two complementary extensions to the easer paradigm are proposed, based on collective and additive models. Through an extensive empirical analysis on several large-scale datasets, we show that our methods can effectively exploit side-information whilst retaining a closed-form solution, and improve upon the state-of-the-art without increasing the computational complexity of the original easer approach. Additionally, empirical results demonstrate that the use of side-information leads to more “long tail” items being recommended, benefiting the recommendations’ coverage of the item catalogue.</p>

    <h3>Long-tail Session-based Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyi Liu, Yujia Zheng</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendation focuses on the prediction of user actions based on anonymous sessions and is a necessary method in the lack of user historical data. However, none of the existing session-based recommendation methods explicitly takes the long-tail recommendation into consideration, which plays an important role in improving the diversity of recommendation and producing the serendipity. As the distribution of items with long-tail is prevalent in session-based recommendation scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, music, and TV program recommendations), more attention should be put on the long-tail session-based recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture, namely TailNet, to improve long-tail recommendation performance, while maintaining competitive accuracy performance compared with other methods. We start by classifying items into short-head (popular) and long-tail (niche) items based on click frequency. Then a novel preference mechanism is proposed and applied in TailNet to determine user preference between two types of items, so as to softly adjust and personalize recommendations. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art works.</p>

    <h3>Module Advisor: A Hybrid Recommender System for Elective Module Exploration (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael P. O’Mahony, Nina Hagemann, Barry Smyth</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are omni-present in our every day lives, guiding us through the vast amount of information available. However, in the academic world, personalised recommendations are less prominent, leaving students to navigate through the typically large space of available courses and modules manually. Since it is crucial for students to make informed choices about their learning pathways, we aim to improve the way students discover elective modules by developing a hybrid recommender system prototype that is specifically designed to help students find elective modules from a diverse set of subjects. We can improve the discoverability of long-tail options and help students broaden their horizons by combining notions of similarity and diversity.</p>

    <h3>The Importance of Song Context in Music Playlists (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Massimo Quadrana, Andreu Vall, Gerhard Widmer, Markus Schedl, Paolo Cremonesi</p>
    <p>Music recommender systems often operate in sequential mode by suggesting a collection of songs that constitute a listening session. This task is usually called automated music playlist generation and it has been previously studied in the literature with different successful approaches based on, e.g., variations of collaborative filtering or content-based similarity. Some of the proposed playlist models take into consideration the current song and a number of previous songs, i.e., the song context , in order to predict the next song. However, it is not yet clear to what extent knowing this song context improves next-song predictions. To shed light on this question, we conduct a numerical experiment on two datasets of hand-curated music playlists, where we compare playlist models that account for different song context lengths. Our results indicate that knowing the song context seems, at first, uninformative. However, we explain this effect by a strong bias in the data towards very popular songs and observe that, in fact, songs in the long tail are more accurately predicted when the song context is considered.</p>

    <h3>Blockbusters and Wallflowers: Accurate, Diverse, and Scalable Recommendations with Random Walks (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chris Newell, Bibek Paudel, Fabian Christoffel, Abraham Bernstein</p>
    <p>User satisfaction is often dependent on providing accurate and diverse recommendations. In this paper, we explore scalable algorithms that exploit random walks as a sampling technique to obtain diverse recommendations without compromising on accuracy. Specifically, we present a novel graph vertex ranking recommendation algorithm called RP3beta that re-ranks items based on 3-hop random walk transition probabilities. We show empirically, that RP3beta provides accurate recommendations with high long-tail item frequency at the top of the recommendation list. We also present scalable approximate versions of RP3beta and the two most accurate previously published vertex ranking algorithms based on random walk transition probabilities and show that these approximations converge with increasing number of samples.</p>

    <p>In this investigation, we conduct a comparison between offline and online accuracy evaluation of different algorithms and settings in a real-world content recommender system. By focusing on recommendations of long-tail items, which are usually more interesting for users, it was possible to reduce the bias caused by extremely popular items and to observe a better alignment of accuracy results in offline and online evaluations.</p>
