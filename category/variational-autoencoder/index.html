    <h3>BVAE: Behavior-aware Variational Autoencoder for Multi-Behavior Multi-Task Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Liu, Qianzhen Rao, Weike Pan, Zhong Ming</p>
    <p>A practical recommender system should be able to handle heterogeneous behavioral feedback as inputs and has multi-task outputs ability. Although the heterogeneous one-class collaborative filtering (HOCCF) and multi-task learning (MTL) methods has been well studied, there is still a lack of targeted manner in their combined fields, i.e., Multi-behavior Multi-task Recommendation (MMR). To fill the gap, we propose a novel recommendation framework called Behavior-aware Variational AutoEncoder (BVAE), which meliorates the parameter sharing and loss minimization method with the VAE structure to address the MMR problem. Specifically, our BVAE includes address behavior-aware semi-encoders and decoders, and a target feature fusion network with a global feature filtering network, while using standard deviation to weigh loss. These modules generate the behavior-aware recommended item list via constructing better semantic feature vectors for users, i.e., from dual perspectives of behavioral preference and global interaction. In addition, we optimize our BVAE in terms of adaptability and robustness, i.e., it is concise and flexible to consume any amount of behaviors with different distributions. Extensive empirical studies on two real and widely used datasets confirm the validity of our design and show that our BVAE can outperform the state-of-the-art related baseline methods under multiple evaluation metrics.</p>

    <h3>Towards Source-Aligned Variational Models for Cross-Domain Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aghiles Salah, Hady Lauw, Thanh Binh Tran</p>
    <p>Data sparsity is a long-standing challenge in recommender systems. Among existing approaches to alleviate this problem, cross-domain recommendation consists in leveraging knowledge from a source domain or category (e.g., Movies) to improve item recommendation in a target domain (e.g., Books). In this work, we advocate a probabilistic approach to cross-domain recommendation and rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) as our latent variable models. More precisely, we assume that we have access to a VAE trained on the source domain that we seek to leverage to improve preference modeling in the target domain. To this end, we propose a model which learns to fit the target observations and align its hidden space with the source latent space jointly. Since we model the latent spaces by the variational posteriors, we operate at this level, and in particular, we investigate two approaches, namely rigid and soft alignments. In the former scenario, the variational model in the target domain is set equal to the source variational model. That is, we only learn a generative model in the target domain. In the soft-alignment scenario, the target VAE has its variational model, but which is encouraged to look like its source counterpart. We analyze the proposed objectives theoretically and conduct extensive experiments to illustrate the benefit of our contribution. Empirical results on six real-world datasets show that the proposed models outperform several comparable cross-domain recommendation models.</p>

    <h3>Latent Multi-Criteria Ratings for Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan Li, Alexander Tuzhilin</p>
    <p>Multi-Criteria Recommender systems have been increasingly valuable for helping the consumers identify the most relevant items with their multi-criteria feedback along different dimensions of user experiences. However, previous design of multi-criteria recommendation algorithms did not take into account user reviews. This is unfortunate because multi-criteria recommender systems suffer from the missing ratings problem and user reviews could be helpful for alleviating the missing ratings and sparsity problem, thus improving the quality of recommendations. Besides, itâ€™s not clear from prior literature how to select the most important criteria to collect from users. In addition, previously proposed methods did not consider the latent semantic relations between users and items. To address these concerns, in this paper we propose a novel design of multi-criteria recommendation based on latent multi-criteria ratings generated from user reviews. In particular, we utilize variational autoencoders to map user reviews into latent embeddings, which are subsequently compressed into smaller dimensional discrete vectors using the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization technique. The resulting compressed vectors constitute latent multi-criteria ratings that we use for the recommendation purposes via standard multi-criteria recommendation methods. We show that the proposed latent multi-criteria rating approach outperforms several baselines significantly and consistently across different datasets and performance evaluation measures. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>
