    <h3>Biased User History Synthesis for Personalized Long-Tail Item Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elan Markowitz, Greg Ver Steeg, Abdulla Alshabanah, Keshav Balasubramanian, Murali Annavaram</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems connect users to items and create value chains in the internet economy. Recommendation systems learn from past user-item interaction histories. As such, items that have short interaction histories, either because they are new or not popular, are disproportionately under-recommended. This long-tail item problem can exacerbate model bias, and reinforce poor recommendation of tail items. In this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm, <i>biased user history synthesis</i>, to not only address this problem but also achieve better personalization in recommendation systems. As a result, we concurrently improve tail and head item recommendation performance. Our approach is built on a tail item biased User Interaction History (UIH) sampling strategy and a synthesis model that produces an augmented user representation from the sampled user history. We provide a theoretical justification for our approach using information theory and demonstrate through extensive experimentation, that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on tail, head, and overall recommendation. the source code is available at https://github.com/lkp411/BiasedUserHistorySynthesis.</p>

    <h3>Repeated Padding for Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianzhe Zhao, Linying Jiang, Yuting Liu, Yizhou Dang, Xingwei Wang, Guibing Guo, Enneng Yang</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation aims to provide users with personalized suggestions based on their historical interactions. When training sequential models, padding is a widely adopted technique for two main reasons: 1) The vast majority of models can only handle fixed-length sequences; 2) Batch-based training needs to ensure that the sequences in each batch have the same length. The special value 0 is usually used as the padding content, which does not contain the actual information and is ignored in the model calculations. This common-sense padding strategy leads us to a problem that has never been explored in the recommendation field: Can we utilize this idle input space by padding other content to improve model performance and training efficiency further? In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective padding method called Repeated Padding (RepPad). Specifically, we use the original interaction sequences as the padding content and fill it to the padding positions during model training. This operation can be performed a finite number of times or repeated until the input sequences’ length reaches the maximum limit. Our RepPad can be considered as a sequence-level data augmentation strategy. Unlike most existing works, our method contains no trainable parameters or hyperparameters and is a plug-and-play data augmentation operation. Extensive experiments on various categories of sequential models and five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. The average recommendation performance improvement is up to 60.3% on GRU4Rec and 24.3% on SASRec. We also provide in-depth analysis and explanation of what makes RepPad effective from multiple perspectives. The source code will be released to ensure the complete reproducibility of our experiments.</p>

    <h3>ConFit: Improving Resume-Job Matching using Data Augmentation and Contrastive Learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhou Yu, Jinzhong Zhang, Xiao Yu</p>
    <p>A reliable resume-job matching system helps a company find suitable candidates from a pool of resumes, and helps a job seeker find relevant jobs from a list of job posts. However, since job seekers apply only to a few jobs, interaction records in resume-job datasets are sparse. Different from many prior work that use complex modeling techniques, we tackle this sparsity problem using data augmentations and a simple contrastive learning approach. ConFit first formulates resume-job datasets as a sparse bipartite graph, and creates an augmented dataset by paraphrasing specific sections in a resume or a job post. Then, ConFit finetunes pre-trained encoders with contrastive learning to further increase training samples from B pairs per batch to O(B^2) per batch. We evaluate ConFit on two real-world datasets and find it outperforms prior methods (including BM25 and OpenAI text-ada-002) by up to 19% and 31% absolute in nDCG@10 for ranking jobs and ranking resumes, respectively. We believe ConFit’s simple yet highly performant approach lays a strong foundation for future research in modeling person-job fit.</p>

    <h3>Data Augmentation using Reverse Prompt for Cost-Efficient Cold-Start Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Genki Kusano</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems that use auxiliary information such as product names and categories have been proposed to address the cold-start problem. However, these methods do not perform well when we only have insufficient warm-start training data. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can perform as effective cold-start recommendation systems even with limited warm-start data. However, they require numerous API calls for inferences, which leads to high operational costs in terms of time and money. This is a significant concern in industrial applications. In this paper, we introduce a new method, RevAug, which leverages LLMs as a data augmentation to enhance cost-efficient cold-start recommendation systems. To generate pseudo-samples, we have reversed the commonly used prompt for an LLM from “Would this user like this item?” to “What kind of items would this user like?”. Generated outputs by this reverse prompt are pseudo-auxiliary information utilized to enhance recommendation systems in the training phase. In numerical experiments with four real-world datasets, RevAug demonstrated superior performance in cold-start settings with limited warm-start data compared to existing methods. Moreover, RevAug significantly reduced API fees and processing time compared to an LLM-based recommendation method.</p>

    <h3>Domain Disentanglement with Interpolative Data Augmentation for Dual-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Zhu, Zhu Sun, Yan Wang, Jiajie Zhu</p>
    <p>The conventional single-target Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) aims to improve the recommendation performance on a sparser target domain by transferring the knowledge from a source domain that contains relatively richer information. By contrast, in recent years, dual-target CDR has been proposed to improve the recommendation performance on both domains simultaneously. However, to this end, there are two challenges in dual-target CDR: (1) how to generate both relevant and diverse augmented user representations, and (2) how to effectively decouple domain-independent information from domain-specific information, in addition to domain-shared information, to capture comprehensive user preferences. To address the above two challenges, we propose a Disentanglement-based framework with Interpolative Data Augmentation for dual-target Cross-Domain Recommendation, called DIDA-CDR. In DIDA-CDR, we first propose an interpolative data augmentation approach to generating both relevant and diverse augmented user representations to augment sparser domain and explore potential user preferences. We then propose a disentanglement module to effectively decouple domain-specific and domain-independent information to capture comprehensive user preferences. Both steps significantly contribute to capturing more comprehensive user preferences, thereby improving the recommendation performance on each domain. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets show the significant superiority of DIDA-CDR over the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>MCM: A Multi-task Pre-trained Customer Model for Personalization (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianxin Wang, Peng Wan, Rui Luo, Jingyuan Deng</p>
    <p>Personalization plays a critical role in helping customers discover the products and contents they prefer for e-commerce stores.Personalized recommendations differ in contents, target customers, and UI. However, they require a common core capability – the ability to deeply understand customers’ preferences and shopping intents. In this paper, we introduce the MLCM (Multi-task Large pre-trained Customer Model), a large pre-trained BERT-based multi-task customer model with 10 million trainable parameters for e-commerce stores. This model aims to empower all personalization projects by providing commonly used preference scores for recommendations, customer embeddings for transfer learning, and a pre-trained model for fine-tuning. In this work, we improve the SOTA BERT4Rec framework to handle heterogeneous customer signals and multi-task training as well as innovate new data augmentation method that is suitable for recommendation task. Experimental results show that MLCM outperforms the original BERT4Rec by 17% on preference prediction tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that the model can be easily fine-tuned to assist a specific recommendation task. For instance, after fine-tuning MLCM for an incentive based recommendation project, performance improves by 60% on the conversion prediction task and 25% on the click-through prediction task compared to the production baseline model.</p>

    <h3>Large Language Model Augmented Narrative Driven Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamed Zamani, Sheshera Mysore, Andrew Mccallum</p>
    <p>Narrative-driven recommendation (NDR) presents an information access problem where users solicit recommendations with verbose descriptions of their preferences and context, for example, travelers soliciting recommendations for points of interest while describing their likes/dislikes and travel circumstances. These requests are increasingly important with the rise of natural language-based conversational interfaces for search and recommendation systems. However, NDR lacks abundant training data for models, and current platforms commonly do not support these requests. Fortunately, classical user-item interaction datasets contain rich textual data, e.g., reviews, which often describe user preferences and context — this may be used to bootstrap training for NDR models. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation to train NDR models. We use LLMs for authoring synthetic narrative queries from user-item interactions with few-shot prompting and train retrieval models for NDR on synthetic queries and user-item interaction data. Our experiments demonstrate that this is an effective strategy for training small-parameter retrieval models that outperform other retrieval and LLM baselines for narrative-driven recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Equivariant Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yueqi Xie, Yining Hua, Sunghun Kim, Jaeboum Kim, Shoujin Wang, Jingqi Gao, Qichen Ye, Peilin Zhou</p>
    <p>Contrastive learning (CL) benefits the training of sequential recommendation models with informative self-supervision signals. Existing solutions apply general sequential data augmentation strategies to generate positive pairs and encourage their representations to be invariant. However, due to the inherent properties of user behavior sequences, some augmentation strategies, such as item substitution, can lead to changes in user intent. Learning indiscriminately invariant representations for all augmentation strategies might be sub-optimal. Therefore, we propose Equivariant Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation (ECL-SR), which endows SR models with great discriminative power, making the learned user behavior representations sensitive to invasive augmentations (e.g., item substitution) and insensitive to mild augmentations (e.g., feature-level dropout masking). In detail, we use the conditional discriminator to capture differences in behavior due to item substitution, which encourages the user behavior encoder to be equivariant to invasive augmentations. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed ECL-SR framework achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art SR models. The source code will be released.</p>

    <h3>Contrastive Learning with Frequency-Domain Interest Trends for Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guisheng Yin, Yuxin Dong, Yichi Zhang</p>
    <p>Recently, contrastive learning for sequential recommendation has demonstrated its powerful ability to learn high-quality user representations. However, constructing augmented samples in the time domain poses challenges due to various reasons, such as fast-evolving trends, interest shifts, and system factors. Furthermore, the F-principle indicates that deep learning preferentially fits the low-frequency part, resulting in poor performance on high-frequency tasks. The complexity of time series and the low-frequency preference limit the utility of sequence encoders. To address these challenges, we need to construct augmented samples from the frequency domain, thus improving the ability to accommodate events of different frequency sizes. To this end, we propose a novel Contrastive Learning with Frequency-Domain Interest Trends for Sequential Recommendation (CFIT4SRec). We treat the embedding representations of historical interactions as “images” and introduce the second-order Fourier transform to construct augmented samples. The components of different frequency sizes reflect the interest trends between attributes and their surroundings in the hidden space. We introduce three data augmentation operations to accommodate events of different frequency sizes: low-pass augmentation, high-pass augmentation, and band-stop augmentation. Extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of CFIT4SRec over the state-of-the-art baselines. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/zhangyichi1Z/CFIT4SRec.</p>

    <h3>An Explanatory Matrix Factorization with User Comments Data (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donghyun Kim, Hayong Shin</p>
    <p>Matrix factorization is one of the crucial algorithms of the Recommendation system. It implies that the relationship between user and contents can be explained by hidden latent variables. However, it is not intuitive to understand the meaning of these hidden latent variables. Therefore, this study suggests a way to learn the meaning from supplementary data such as comments and use in matrix factorization. The data used in this study is user comment data from Naver which is the largest web platform and also the largest Webtoons (Web comics) platform in South Korea. We show that the suggest method which uses the supervised latent variable also fits well with users with the distinct tendency compare to conventional matrix factorization.</p>
