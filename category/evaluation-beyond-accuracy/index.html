    <h3>Estimating Long-term Effects from Experimental Data (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lihong Li, Ziyang Tang, Stephanie Zhang, Yiheng Duan, Steven Zhu</p>
    <p>A/B testing is a powerful tool for a company to make informed decisions about their services and products. A limitation of A/B tests is that they do not easily extend to measure post-experiment (long-term) differences. In this talk, we study a different approach inspired by recent advances in off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning (RL). The basic RL approach assumes customer behavior follows a stationary Markovian process, and estimates the average engagement metric when the process reaches the steady state. However, in realistic scenarios, the stationary assumption is often violated due to weekly variations and seasonality effects. To tackle this challenge, we propose a variation by relaxing the stationary assumption. We empirically tested both stationary and nonstationary approaches in a synthetic dataset and an online store dataset.</p>

    <h3>Learning to Represent Human Motives for Goal-directed Web Browsing (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longqi Yang, Jyun-Yu Jiang, Bahareh Sarrafzadeh, Brent Hecht, Jaime Teevan, Chia-Jung Lee</p>
    <p>Motives or goals are recognized in psychology literature as the most fundamental drive that explains and predicts why people do what they do, including when they browse the web. Although providing enormous value, these higher-ordered goals are often unobserved, and little is known about how to leverage such goals to assist peopleâ€™s browsing activities. This paper proposes to take a new approach to address this problem, which is fulfilled through a novel neural framework, Goal-directed Web Browsing  (GoWeB). We adopt a psychologically-sound taxonomy of higher-ordered goals and learn to build their representations in a structure-preserving manner. Then we incorporate the resulting representations for enhancing the experiences of common activities people perform on the web. Experiments on large-scale data from Microsoft Edge web browser show that GoWeB significantly outperforms competitive baselines for in-session web page recommendation, re-visitation classification, and goal-based web page grouping. A follow-up analysis further characterizes how the variety of human motives can affect the difference observed in human behavioral patterns.</p>
