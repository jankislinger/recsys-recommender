    <h3>Enhancing Sequential Music Recommendation with Negative Feedback-informed Contrastive Learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahrzad Shashaani, Pavan Seshadri, Peter Knees</p>
    <p>Modern music streaming services are heavily based on recommen- dation engines to serve continuous content to users. Sequential recommendation—continuously providing new items within a sin- gle session in a contextually coherent manner—has been an emerg- ing topic in current literature. User feedback—a positive or negative response to the item presented—is used to drive content recom- mendations by learning user preferences. We extend this idea to the session-based recommendation domain to improve learning of context-coherent music recommendations by modelling negative user feedback, i.e., skips, in the loss function. To this end, we propose a sequence-aware contrastive sub-task to structure item embeddings in session-based music recommen- dation, such that true next-positive items (ignoring skipped items) are structured closer in the embedding space, while skipped tracks are structured farther away from all items in the session. Since this causes skipped item embeddings in a session to be farther than unskipped items in the learned space, this directly affects item rankings using a K-nearest-neighbors search for next-item recom- mendations, while also promoting the rank of the true next item. Experiments incorporating this task into SoTA methods for sequen- tial item recommendation show consistent performance gains in terms of next-item hit rate, item ranking, and skip down-ranking on three music recommendation datasets, strongly benefiting from increasing presence of user feedback.</p>

    <h3>Recommending Personalised Targeted Training Adjustments for Marathon Runners (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ciara Feely, Aonghus Lawlor, Barry Smyth, Brian Caulfield</p>
    <p>Preparing for the marathon involves many weeks of dedicated training. Achieving the right balance between building strength and endurance and the need for rest and recovery is a must, if a runner is to arrive at the start-line injury-free and ready to achieve their desired finish-time. However, because most recreational runners rely on generic training plans, they can struggle to find this balance, which can impact their motivation, health, and performance. In this paper, we describe a novel case-based reasoning approach to fine-tuning a runner’s training by recommending training adjustments based on the patterns of similar runners at corresponding points in their marathon training. The approach is designed to target training adjustments that are based on similar runners but with varying race goals,  to allow runners to adjust their training for slower or faster finish-times, as their training progresses and motivations change. We evaluate the recommendations produced using a large-scale real-world dataset according to several factors including, (i) the plausibility of the recommended training adjustment, (ii) the effectiveness of the adjustment when it comes to achieving a particular performance goal, and (iii) the safety of the adjustment in terms of the degree of risk that it will lead to an injury or otherwise disrupt training. Our findings suggest that plausible, effective, and safe recommendations can be generated for runners when evaluated against a range of race goals.</p>

    <h3>The MovieLens Beliefs Dataset: Collecting Pre-Choice Data for Online Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guy Aridor, Duarte Goncalves, Daniel Kluver, Ruoyan Kong, Joseph Konstan</p>
    <p>An increasingly important aspect of designing recommender systems involves considering how recommendations will influence consumer choices. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a method for collecting user beliefs about un-experienced items – a critical predictor of choice behavior. We implemented this method on the MovieLens platform, resulting in a rich dataset that combines user ratings, beliefs, and observed recommendations. We document challenges to such data collection, including selection bias in response and limited coverage of the product space. This unique resource empowers researchers to delve deeper into user behavior and analyze user choices absent recommendations, measure the effectiveness of recommendations, and prototype algorithms that leverage user belief data, ultimately leading to more impactful recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Self-Auxiliary Distillation for Sample Efficient Learning in Google-Scale Recommenders (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruoxi Wang, Tiansheng Yao, Ed H. Chi, Andrew Evdokimov, Yuan Gao, Jerry Zhang, Evan Ettinger, Derek Zhiyuan Cheng, Yin Zhang, Jonathan Valverde, Xiang Li</p>
    <p>Industrial recommendation systems process billions of daily user feedback which are complex and noisy. Efficiently uncovering user preference from these signals becomes crucial for high-quality recommendation. We argue that those signals are not inherently equal in terms of their informative value and training ability, which is particularly salient in industrial applications with multi-stage processes (e.g., augmentation, retrieval, ranking). Considering that, in this work, we propose a novel self-auxiliary distillation framework that prioritizes training on high-quality labels, and improves the resolution of low-quality labels through distillation by adding a bilateral branch-based auxiliary task. This approach enables flexible learning from diverse labels without additional computational costs, making it highly scalable and effective for Google-scale recommenders. Our framework consistently improved both offline and online key business metrics across three Google major products. Notably, self-auxiliary distillation proves to be highly effective in addressing the severe signal loss challenge posed by changes such as Apple iOS policy. It further delivered significant improvements in both offline (+17\% AUC) and online metrics for a Google Apps recommendation system. This highlights the opportunities of addressing real-world signal loss problems through self-auxiliary distillation techniques.</p>

    <h3>Learning From Negative User Feedback and Measuring Responsiveness for Sequential Recommenders (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuo Chang, Yueqi Wang, Elaine Ya Le, Shane Li, Yaping Zhang, Xujian Liang, Yoni Halpern, Shuchao Bi, Longfei Li, Jingchen Feng, Min-Cheng Huang, Alex Beutel</p>
    <p>Sequential recommenders have been widely used in industry due to their strength in modeling user preferences. While these models excel at learning a user’s positive interests, less attention has been paid to learn from negative user feedback. Negative user feedback is an important lever of user control, and comes with an expectation that recommenders should respond quickly and reduce similar recommendations to the user. However, negative feedback signals are often ignored in the training objective of sequential recommenders, which primarily aim at predicting positive user interactions. In this work, we incorporate explicit and implicit negative user feedback into the training objective of sequential recommenders using a “not-to-recommend” loss function that optimizes for the log likelihood of not recommending items with negative feedback. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using live experiments on a large-scale industrial recommender system. Furthermore, we address a challenge in measuring recommender responsiveness to negative feedback by developing a counterfactual simulation framework to compare recommender responses between different user actions, showing improved responsiveness from the modeling change.</p>

    <h3>Transparently Serving the Public: Enhancing Public Service Media Values through Exploration (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Grün, Xenija Neufeld</p>
    <p>In the last few years, we have reportedly underlined the importance of the Public Service Media Remit for ZDF as a Public Service Media provider. Offering fair, diverse, and useful recommendations to users is just as important for us as being transparent about our understanding of these values, the metrics that we are using to evaluate their extent, and the algorithms in our system that produce such recommendations. This year, we have made a major step towards transparency of our algorithms and metrics describing them for a broader audience, offering the possibility for the audience to learn details about our systems and to provide direct feedback to us. Having the possibility to measure and track PSM metrics, we have started to improve our algorithms towards PSM values. In this work, we describe these steps and the results of actively debasing and adding exploration into our recommendations to achieve more fairness.</p>

    <h3>Who do you think I am? Interactive User Modelling with Item Metadata (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bart Goethals, Koen Ruymbeek, Joey De Pauw</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are used in many different applications and contexts, however their main goal can always be summarised as “connecting relevant content to interested users”. Explanations have been found to help recommender systems achieve this goal by giving users a look under the hood that helps them understand why they are recommended certain items. Furthermore, explanations can be considered to be the first step towards interacting with the system. Indeed, for a user to give feedback and guide the system towards better understanding her preferences, it helps if the user has a better idea of what the system has already learned.<br>To this end, we propose a linear collaborative filtering recommendation model that builds user profiles within the domain of item metadata. Our method is hence inherently transparent and explainable. Moreover, since recommendations are computed as a linear function of item metadata and the interpretable user profile, our method seamlessly supports interactive recommendation. In other words, users can directly tweak the weights of the learned profile for more fine-grained browsing and discovery of content based on their current interests. We demonstrate the interactive aspect of this model in an online application for discovering cultural events in Belgium.</p>

    <h3>Do Users Appreciate Explanations of Recommendations? An Analysis in the Movie Domain (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Felfernig, Viet Man Le, Martin Stettinger, Muesluem Atas, Thi Ngoc Trang Tran</p>
    <p>In this paper, we provide insights into users’ needs regarding the inclusion of explanations in a movie recommender system. We have developed different variants of a movie recommender system prototype corresponding to different types of explanations and conducted an online user study to evaluate related explanations. The experimental results show that users do not always appreciate explanations. They want to see explanations when they are not satisfied with the recommended items. They expect to see explanations showing how well the recommended item meets their preferences. Moreover, explanation goals are interdependent and affect the overall satisfaction of users with the recommender system.</p>

    <h3>Investigating Multimodal Features for Video Recommendations at Globoplay (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Ferreira</p>
    <p>Globoplay is Globo Group’s digital video streaming platform and offers a very diverse video content catalogue ranging from international to brazilian productions such as movies, series, soap operas, and TV programs produced by Globo Group. One of the challenges with such large and diverse content collection is its distribution to the user base in order to help our subscribers with finding relevant content that meets their expectations and to increase their engagement with the product. In this work, we show the result of a content-based recommendation approach based on multi-modal features such as visual characteristics and audio patterns found in the video content. Using techniques applied to short videos, we model it as a similarity problem based on the content of the video, where, given a video, we establish the top-n videos most similar to it in the collection. For the evaluation, we conducted a study through interviews with a group of users to understand their perception of recommendations based on audiovisual characteristics. For the future, we plan to: explore and define the best approach to combine text, audio and video features for video recommendations; explore audiovisual features with other recommendation approaches such as session based and collaborative filtering; perform AB testing in production; and evaluate the proposal impact in business metrics.</p>

    <h3>Combining Text Summarization and Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis of Users’ Reviews to Justify Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Lops, Giovanni Semeraro, Marco de Gemmis, Cataldo Musto, Gaetano Rossiello</p>
    <p>In this paper we present a methodology to justify recommendations that relies on the information extracted from users’ reviews discussing the available items. The intuition behind the approach is to conceive the justification as a summary of the most relevant and distinguishing aspects ofthe item, automatically obtained by analyzing the available reviews. To this end, we designed a pipeline of natural language processing techniques based on aspect extraction, sentiment analysis and text summarization to gather the reviews, process the relevant excerpts,and generate a unique synthesis presenting the main characteristics of the item. Such a summary is finally presented to the target user as justification of the recommendation she received. In the experimental evaluation we carried out a user study in the movie domain (N=141) and the results showed that our approach is able to make the recommendation process more transparent, engaging and trustful for the users. Moreover, the proposed method also beat another review-based explanation technique, thus confirming the validity of our intuition. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Latent Multi-Criteria Ratings for Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan Li, Alexander Tuzhilin</p>
    <p>Multi-Criteria Recommender systems have been increasingly valuable for helping the consumers identify the most relevant items with their multi-criteria feedback along different dimensions of user experiences. However, previous design of multi-criteria recommendation algorithms did not take into account user reviews. This is unfortunate because multi-criteria recommender systems suffer from the missing ratings problem and user reviews could be helpful for alleviating the missing ratings and sparsity problem, thus improving the quality of recommendations. Besides, it’s not clear from prior literature how to select the most important criteria to collect from users. In addition, previously proposed methods did not consider the latent semantic relations between users and items. To address these concerns, in this paper we propose a novel design of multi-criteria recommendation based on latent multi-criteria ratings generated from user reviews. In particular, we utilize variational autoencoders to map user reviews into latent embeddings, which are subsequently compressed into smaller dimensional discrete vectors using the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization technique. The resulting compressed vectors constitute latent multi-criteria ratings that we use for the recommendation purposes via standard multi-criteria recommendation methods. We show that the proposed latent multi-criteria rating approach outperforms several baselines significantly and consistently across different datasets and performance evaluation measures. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Deep Language-based Critiquing for Recommender Systems (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ga Wu, Scott Sanner, Harold Soh, Kai Luo</p>
    <p>Critiquing is a method for conversational recommendation that adapts recommendations in response to user preference feedback regarding item attributes.  Historical critiquing methods were largely based on constraint- and utility-based methods for modifying recommendations w.r.t. these critiqued attributes.  In this paper, we revisit the critiquing approach from the lens of deep learning based recommendation methods and language-based interaction.  Concretely, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework with two variants that extend the Neural Collaborative Filtering architecture with explanation and critiquing components.  These architectures not only predict personalized keyphrases for a user and item but also embed language-based feedback in the latent space that in turn modulates subsequent critiqued recommendations. We evaluate the proposed framework on two recommendation datasets containing user reviews.  Empirical results show that our modified NCF approach not only provides a strong baseline recommender and high-quality personalized item keyphrase suggestions, but that it also properly suppresses items predicted to have a critiqued keyphrase. In summary, this paper provides a first step to unify deep recommendation and language-based feedback in what we hope to be a rich space for future research in deep critiquing for conversational recommendation.</p>

    <p>Large pharmaceutical companies have a wealth of reaction and chemical structure data, but face a new problem: analyzing that corpus to yield project insights and future directions. One straightforward approach would be to have a recommendation system to match drug structures with similar research endeavors across geographically- or organizationally-separated groups. We developed and deployed Chem Recommender, a system that suggests similar, related work to experiments that chemists have recently started. The goal of the system is to accelerate the drug discovery process by ensuring that chemists are aware of each other’s work. To date, we have sent more than 8500 recommendations to over 800 medicinal chemists in our organization. The results have been positive, with several chemists reporting that the recommendations have aided their molecular syntheses.</p>

    <h3>A Hierarchical Bayesian Model for Size Recommendation in Fashion (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuen King Ho, Abdul-Saboor Sheikh, Evgenyi Koryagin, Reza Shirvany, Urs Bergmann, Romain Guigourès</p>
    <p>We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian approach to tackle the challenging problem of size recommendation in e-commerce fashion. Our approach jointly models a size purchased by a customer, and its possible return event: 1. no return, 2. returned too small 3. returned too big. Those events are drawn following a multinomial distribution parameterized on the joint probability of each event, built following a hierarchy combining priors. Such a model allows us to incorporate extended domain expertise and article characteristics as prior knowledge, which in turn makes it possible for the underlying parameters to emerge thanks to sufficient data. Experiments are presented on real (anonymized) data from millions of customers along with a detailed discussion on the efficiency of such an approach within a large scale production system.</p>

    <p>Matrix factorization is one of the crucial algorithms of the Recommendation system. It implies that the relationship between user and contents can be explained by hidden latent variables. However, it is not intuitive to understand the meaning of these hidden latent variables. Therefore, this study suggests a way to learn the meaning from supplementary data such as comments and use in matrix factorization. The data used in this study is user comment data from Naver which is the largest web platform and also the largest Webtoons (Web comics) platform in South Korea. We show that the suggest method which uses the supervised latent variable also fits well with users with the distinct tendency compare to conventional matrix factorization.</p>
