    <h3>Adaptive Collaborative Filtering with Personalized Time Decay Functions for Financial Product Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baptiste Barreau, Michalis Vazirgiannis, Ashraf Ghiye, Laurent Carlier</p>
    <p>Classical recommender systems often assume that historical data are stationary and fail to account for the dynamic nature of user preferences, limiting their ability to provide reliable recommendations in time-sensitive settings. This assumption is particularly problematic in finance, where financial products exhibit continuous changes in valuations, leading to frequent shifts in client interests. These evolving interests, summarized in the past client-product interactions, see their utility fade over time with a degree that might differ from one client to another. To address this challenge, we propose a time-dependent collaborative filtering algorithm that can adaptively discount distant client-product interactions using personalized decay functions. Our approach is designed to handle the non-stationarity of financial data and produce reliable recommendations by modeling the dynamic collaborative signals between clients and products. We evaluate our method using a proprietary dataset from BNP Paribas and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art benchmarks from relevant literature. Our findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time explicitly in the model to enhance the accuracy of financial product recommendation.</p>

    <h3>History-Augmented Collaborative Filtering for Financial Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baptiste Barreau, Laurent Carlier</p>
    <p>In many businesses, and particularly in finance, the behavior of a client might drastically change over time. It is consequently crucial for recommender systems used in such environments to be able to adapt to these changes. In this study, we propose a novel collaborative filtering algorithm that captures the temporal context of a user-item interaction through the users’ and items’ recent interaction histories to provide dynamic recommendations. The algorithm, designed with issues specific to the financial world in mind, uses a custom neural network architecture that tackles the non-stationarity of users’ and items’ behaviors. The performance and properties of the algorithm are monitored in a series of experiments on a G10 bond request for quotation proprietary database from BNP Paribas Corporate and Institutional Banking.</p>

    <h3>Large-scale Recommendation for Portfolio Optimization (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Marcel Edwin Swezey, Bruno Charron</p>
    <p>Individual investors are now massively using online brokers to trade stocks with convenient interfaces and low fees, albeit losing the advice and personalization traditionally provided by full-service brokers. We frame the problem faced by online brokers of replicating this level of service in a low-cost and automated manner for a very large number of users. Because of the care required in recommending financial products, we focus on a risk-management approach tailored to each user’s portfolio and risk profile. We show that our hybrid approach, based on Modern Portfolio Theory and Collaborative Filtering, provides a sound and effective solution. The method is applicable to stocks as well as other financial assets, and can be easily combined with various financial forecasting models. We validate our proposal by comparing it with several baselines in a domain expert-based study.</p>
