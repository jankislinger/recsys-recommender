    <h3>Generic Automated Lead Ranking in Dynamics CRM (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Royi Ronen, Edan Hauon, Gopal Kasturi, AJ Ezzour, Oron Nir, Hilik Berezin, Rotem Preizler, Sayalee Bhanavase</p>
    <p>We developed a generic framework which enables Customer Relationship Management (CRM) organizations to deploy an automated ranking system for leads (commonly known as ‘lead scoring’). Leads are records that represent non-customers who might become customers. Lead ranking is a fundamental CRM problem with many flavors. Ranking serves as a prioritization management tool for CRM organizations, with many characteristics similar to those of recommender systems.<br>We present the system with its most recent developments, emphasizing challenges that go beyond the core of the learning algorithm, and that have played an instrumental role in maturing the system into a trustable feature, robust to different types of organizations and datasets. Particularly, we present features which enable Human in the Loop [1], a dominant concept in both configuration and result consumption. Another type of features demonstrates the addition of domain knowledge into the machine learning based process.<br>We present the concepts of feature selection, with and without human help, prediction explanations, insights on model inputs, data quality issues, training for UX consistency, and actionability for each individual prediction.</p>

    <h3>A Novel Graph-based Model for Hybrid Recommendations in Cold-start Scenarios (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesare Bernardis, Paolo Cremonesi, Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema</p>
    <p>Cold-start is a very common and still open problem in the Recommender Systems literature. Since cold start items do not have any interaction, collaborative algorithms are not applicable. One of the main strategies is to use pure or hybrid content-based approaches, which usually yield to lower recommendation quality than collaborative ones. Some techniques to optimize performance of this type of approaches have been studied in recent past. One of them is called feature weighting, which assigns to every feature a real value, called weight, that estimates its importance. Statistical techniques for feature weighting commonly used in Information Retrieval, like TF-IDF, have been adapted for Recommender Systems, but they often do not provide sufficient quality improvements. More recent approaches, FBSM and LFW, estimate weights by leveraging collaborative information via machine learning, in order to learn the importance of a feature based on other users opinions. This type of models have shown promising results compared to classic statistical analyzes cited previously. We propose a novel graph, feature-based machine learning model to face the cold-start item scenario, learning the relevance of features from probabilities of item-based collaborative filtering algorithms.</p>

    <h3>Scalable Audience Targeted Models for Brand Advertising on Social Networks (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kunpeng Zhang</p>
    <p>People are using social media to generate, share, and communicate information with each other. Finding actionable insights from such big data has attracted a lot of research attentions on, for example, finding targeted user groups based on their historical on-line activities. However, existing machine learning algorithms fail to keep up with the increasing large data volume. In this paper, we develop a scalable regression-based algorithm called distributed iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (DISTA) that can identify potential users. Our experiments conducted on Facebook data containing billions of users and associated activities show that DISTA with feature selection not only enables on-line audience-targeted approach for precise marketing but also performs efficiently on parallel computers.</p>

    <h3>Improving The Discriminative Power Of Inferred Content Information Using Segmented Virtual Profile (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Trevor Walker, Anmol Bhasin, Anuj Goyal, Haishan Liu</p>
    <p>We present a novel component of a hybrid recommender system at LinkedIn, where item features are augmented by a virtual profile based on observed user-item interactions. The concept of virtual profiles is generating a representation of an item in the user feature space by leveraging the over-represented user features from users that interacted with the item. It is a way to think about Collaborative Filtering with content features. The core principle is that if the feature occurs with high probability for the users who interacted with an item (henceforth termed as relevant users) versus those who did not (henceforth termed non-relevant users), then that feature is a good candidate to be included in the virtual profile of the item in question. However this scheme suffers from the data imbalance problem, given that observed relevant users are usually an extremely small minority group compared to the whole user base. Feature selection in this skewed setting is prone to noise from the overwhelming non-relevant examples that belong to the majority class. To alleviate the problem, we propose a method to select the most relevant non-relevant examples from the majority class by segmenting users on certain intelligently selected feature dimensions. The resulting virtual profile from the method is called the segmented virtual profile. Empirical evaluation on real-world large scale recommender system at LinkedIn shows that simple strategies for the segmentation yield significantly better performance.</p>
