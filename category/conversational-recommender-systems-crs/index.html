    <h3>GenUI(ne) CRS: UI Elements and Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Conversational Recommender Systems with LLMs (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lien Michiels, Annelien Smets, Ulysse Maes</p>
    <p>Previous research has used Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop personalized Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) with text-based user interfaces (UIs). However, the potential of LLMs to generate interactive graphical elements that enhance user experience remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce “GenUI(ne) CRS,” a novel framework designed to leverage LLMs for adaptive and interactive UIs. Our framework supports domain-specific graphical elements such as buttons and cards, in addition to text-based inputs. It also addresses the common LLM issue of outdated knowledge, known as the “knowledge cut-off,” by implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To illustrate its potential, we developed a prototype movie CRS. This work demonstrates the feasibility of LLM-powered interactive UIs and paves the way for future CRS research, including user experience validation, transparent explanations, and addressing LLM biases.</p>

    <h3>Generation-based vs. Retrieval-based Conversational Recommendation: A User-Centric Comparison (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Ahtsham Manzoor</p>
    <p>In the past few years we observed a renewed interest in conversational recommender systems (CRS) that interact with users in natural language. Most recent research efforts use neural models trained on recorded recommendation dialogs between humans, supporting an end-to-end learning process. Given the user’s utterances in a dialog, these systems aim to generate appropriate responses in natural language based on the learned models. An alternative to such language generation approaches is to retrieve and possibly adapt suitable sentences from the recorded dialogs. Approaches of this latter type are explored only to a lesser extent in the current literature.<br>In this work, we revisit the potential value of retrieval-based approaches to conversational recommendation. To that purpose, we compare two recent deep learning models for response generation with a retrieval-based method that determines a set of response candidates using a nearest-neighbor technique and heuristically reranks them. We adopt a user-centric evaluation approach, where study participants (N=60) rated the responses of the three compared systems. We could reproduce the claimed improvement of one of the deep learning methods over the other. However, the retrieval-based system outperformed both language generation based approaches in terms of the perceived quality of the system responses. Overall, our study suggests that retrieval-based approaches should be considered as an alternative or complement to modern language generation-based approaches.</p>
