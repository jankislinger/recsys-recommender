    <h3>Joint Modeling of Search and Recommendations Via an Unified Contextual Recommender (UniCoRn) (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudarshan Lamkhede, Vito Ostuni, Moumita Bhattacharya</p>
    <p>Search and recommendation systems are essential in many services,and they are often developed separately, leading to complex maintenance and technical debt. In this paper, we present a unified deep learning model that efficiently handles key aspects of both tasks</p>

    <h3>Encouraging Exploration in Spotify Search through Query Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henrik Lindstrom, Humberto Jesús Corona Pampín, Alva Liu, Enrico Palumbo</p>
    <p>At Spotify, search has been traditionally seen as a tool for retrieving content, with the search system optimized for when the user has a specific search target in mind. In particular we have relied on an instant search system providing results for each keystroke, which works well for known-item search, when queries are straightforward, and the catalog is small. However, as Spotify’s catalog grows in size and variety, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to define their search intents accurately. Furthermore, as we expand the offering, we need to help users discover more content both when it comes to new content types, e.g. audiobooks, as well as for new content/creators within existing content types. To solve this we have introduced a hybrid Query Recommendation system (QR) that helps the user formulate more complex exploratory search intents, while still serving known-item lookups efficiently. This experience has been rolled out worldwide to all mobile users resulting in an increase in exploratory intent queries of ~9% in online A/B tests.</p>

    <h3>Recommendations and Results Organization in Netflix Search (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudarshan Lamkhede</p>
    <p>Personalized recommendations on the Netflix Homepage are based on a user’s viewing habits and the behavior of similar users. These recommendations, organized for efficient browsing, enable users to discover the next great video to watch and enjoy without additional input or an explicit expression of their intents or goals. The Netflix Search experience, on the other hand, allows users to take active control of discovering new videos by explicitly expressing their entertainment needs via search queries. In this talk, we discuss the importance of producing search results that go beyond traditional keyword-matches to effectively satisfy users’ search needs in the Netflix entertainment setting. Motivated by users’ various search intents, we highlight the necessity to improve Search by applying approaches that have historically powered the Homepage. Specifically, we discuss our approach to leverage recommendations in the context of Search and to effectively organize search results to provide a product experience that meaningfully adds value for our users.</p>
