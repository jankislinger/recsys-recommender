    <h3>Ghosting: Contextualized Inline Query Completion in Large Scale Retail Search (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uma Murthy, Lakshmi Ramachandran</p>
    <p>Query auto-completion presents a ranked list of queries as suggestions for a user-entered prefix. Ghosting is the process of auto-completing a search recommendation by highlighting the suggested text inline within the search box. We propose the use of a behavior-based recommendation model along with customer search context to ghost on high-confidence queries. We tested ghosting on a retail production system, on over 140 million search sessions. We found that session-context based ghosting significantly increased the acceptance of offered suggestions by 6.18%, reduced misspellings among searches by 4.42%, and improved net sales by 0.14%.</p>

    <h3>Recommending Social-Interactive Games for Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Soledad Pera, Yiu-Kai D. Ng</p>
    <p>Games play a significant role in modern society, since they affect people of all ages and all walks of life, whether it be socially or mentally, and have direct impacts on adults with autism. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by qualitative impairments in social relatedness and interaction, as well as difficulties in acquiring and using communication and language abilities. Adults with ASD often find it difficult to express and recognize emotions which makes it hard for them to interact with others socially. We have designed new interactive and collaborative games for autistic adults and developed a novel strategy to recommend games to them. Using modern computer vision and graphics techniques, we (i) track the playerâ€™s speech rate, facial features, eye contact, audio communication, and emotional states, and (ii) foster their collaboration. These games are personalized and recommended to a user based on games interested to the user, besides the complexity of games at different levels according to the deficient level of the emotional understanding and social skills to which the user belongs. The objective of developing and recommending short-head (i.e., familiar) and long-tail (i.e., unfamiliar) games for adults with ASD is to enhance their necessary social interacting skills with peers so that they can live a normal life.</p>

    <h3>Item Familiarity Effects in User-Centric Evaluations of Recommender Systems (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Jugovac, Dietmar Jannach, Lukas Lerche</p>
    <p>Laboratory studies are a common way of comparing recommendation approaches with respect to different quality dimensions that might be relevant for real users. One typical experimental setup is to first present the participants with recommendation lists that were created with different algorithms and then ask the participants to assess these recommendations individually or to compare two item lists. The cognitive effort required by the participants for the evaluation of item recommendations in such settings depends on whether or not they already know the (features of the) recommended items. Furthermore, lists containing popular and broadly known items are correspondingly easier to evaluate. In this paper we report the results of a user study in which participants recruited on a crowdsourcing platform assessed system-provided recommendations in a between-subjects experimental design. The results surprisingly showed that . An analysis revealed a measurable correlation between item familiarity and user acceptance. Overall, the observations indicate that item familiarity can be a potential confounding factor in such studies and should be considered in experimental designs.</p>
