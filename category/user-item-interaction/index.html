    <h3>One-class recommendation systems  with  the hinge pairwise distance loss and orthogonal representations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramin Raziperchikolaei, Young-joo Chung</p>
    <p>In one-class recommendation systems, the goal is to learn a model from a small set of interacted users and items and then identify the positively-related (i.e., similar) user-item pairs among a large number of pairs with unknown interactions. Most loss functions in the literature rely on dissimilar pairs of users and items, which are selected from the ones with unknown interactions, to obtain better prediction performance. The main issue of this strategy is that it needs a large number of dissimilar pairs, which increases the training time significantly. In this paper, the goal is to only use the similar set to train the models and discard the dissimilar set.  We highlight three trivial solutions that the models converge to when they are trained only on similar pairs: collapsed, dimensional collapsed, and shrinking solutions. We propose a hinge pairwise loss and an orthogonality term that can be added to the objective functions in the literature to avoid these trivial solutions. We conduct experiments on various tasks on public and real-world datasets, which show that our approach using only similar pairs can be trained several times faster than the state-of-the-art methods while achieving competitive results.</p>

    <h3>Explainable Graph Neural Network Recommenders; Challenges and Opportunities (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Reza Mohammadi</p>
    <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in recommendation tasks by effectively capturing intricate connections among users, items, and their associated features. Given the escalating demand for interpretability, current research endeavors in the domain of GNNs for Recommender Systems (RecSys) necessitate the development of explainer methodologies to elucidate the decision-making process underlying GNN-based recommendations. In this work, we aim to present our research focused on techniques to extend beyond the existing approaches for addressing interpretability in GNN-based RecSys.</p>

    <h3>Large Language Model Augmented Narrative Driven Recommendations (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamed Zamani, Sheshera Mysore, Andrew Mccallum</p>
    <p>Narrative-driven recommendation (NDR) presents an information access problem where users solicit recommendations with verbose descriptions of their preferences and context, for example, travelers soliciting recommendations for points of interest while describing their likes/dislikes and travel circumstances. These requests are increasingly important with the rise of natural language-based conversational interfaces for search and recommendation systems. However, NDR lacks abundant training data for models, and current platforms commonly do not support these requests. Fortunately, classical user-item interaction datasets contain rich textual data, e.g., reviews, which often describe user preferences and context — this may be used to bootstrap training for NDR models. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation to train NDR models. We use LLMs for authoring synthetic narrative queries from user-item interactions with few-shot prompting and train retrieval models for NDR on synthetic queries and user-item interaction data. Our experiments demonstrate that this is an effective strategy for training small-parameter retrieval models that outperform other retrieval and LLM baselines for narrative-driven recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Graph Construction for Improving Diversity of Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Te Lei, Yuqing Hou, Huaiwen Wu, Jiale Guo, Qing Zhang, Hengliang Luo, Rui Ye, Yunxing Zhang</p>
    <p>The diversity of recommendation has attracted a lot of attention in recommender systems due to its ability to improve user experience. Most of the diversified recommendation tasks usually exploit user-item interaction records for mining user explicit preferences, while rarely explore the user-item non-interaction records. For diversified recommendations, however, the neglected non-interaction records are especially important for capturing users’ potential interests to improve the diversity of recommendation. Moreover, the majority of diversified recommendation methods run in two stages: first optimizing the users and items embeddings by relevance, then generating the diversified items list by post-processing methods. These methods are not end-to-end thus can hardly reach global optimum. To solve above limitations, we propose an end-to-end Dynamic Diversified Graph framework (DDGraph) which constructs the user-item graph dynamically based on the users and items embeddings. Technically, we initialize a user-item interaction graph and dynamically update the graph by selecting a set of diverse items for each user and building links between the items and user. The selection of diverse items can be achieved by different candidate selection operators. Specifically, we design a Quantile Progressive Candidate Selection (QPCS) operator based on the latent space division. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to diversify recommendation results by dynamic end-to-end graph construction and the QPCS has a higher computational efficiency than other operators. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the DDGraph framework.</p>

    <h3>Select and Predict: Multitask Learning for Recommender Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guy Hadash, Rita Osadchy, Oren Sar Shalom</p>
    <p>The two main tasks in the Recommender Systems domain are the selection and prediction tasks. The prediction task aims at predicting to what extent a user would like any given item, which would enable to recommend the items with the highest predicted scores. The selection task on the other hand directly aims at recommending the most valuable items for the user. Several Multitask Learning approaches have been proposed to learn user and item representations that optimize both tasks simultaneously. In this work, we propose a novel framework that exploits the fact that a user first decides to interact with an item (selection task) and afterward to rate it (prediction task). We evaluated our framework on 2 benchmark datasets, on 2 different configurations and show its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.</p>
