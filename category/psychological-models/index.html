    <h3>Towards Psychologically Grounded Dynamic Preference Models (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Recht, Mihaela Curmei, Dylan Hadfield-Menell, Andreas Haupt</p>
    <p>Designing recommendation systems that serve content aligned with time varying preferences requires proper accounting of the feedback effects of recommendations on human behavior and psychological condition. We argue that modeling the influence of recommendations on people’s preferences must be grounded in psychologically plausible models. We contribute a methodology for developing grounded dynamic preference models. We demonstrate this method with models that capture three classic effects from the psychology literature: Mere-Exposure, Operant Conditioning, and Hedonic Adaptation. We conduct simulation-based studies to show that the psychological models manifest distinct behaviors that can inform system design. Our study has two direct implications for dynamic user modeling in recommendation systems. First, the methodology we outline is broadly applicable for psychologically grounding dynamic preference models. It allows us to critique recent contributions based on their limited discussion of psychological foundation and their implausible predictions. Second, we discuss implications of dynamic preference models for recommendation systems evaluation and design. In an example, we show that engagement and diversity metrics may be unable to capture desirable recommendation system performance.</p>

    <h3>Learning to Represent Human Motives for Goal-directed Web Browsing (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longqi Yang, Jyun-Yu Jiang, Bahareh Sarrafzadeh, Brent Hecht, Jaime Teevan, Chia-Jung Lee</p>
    <p>Motives or goals are recognized in psychology literature as the most fundamental drive that explains and predicts why people do what they do, including when they browse the web. Although providing enormous value, these higher-ordered goals are often unobserved, and little is known about how to leverage such goals to assist people’s browsing activities. This paper proposes to take a new approach to address this problem, which is fulfilled through a novel neural framework, Goal-directed Web Browsing  (GoWeB). We adopt a psychologically-sound taxonomy of higher-ordered goals and learn to build their representations in a structure-preserving manner. Then we incorporate the resulting representations for enhancing the experiences of common activities people perform on the web. Experiments on large-scale data from Microsoft Edge web browser show that GoWeB significantly outperforms competitive baselines for in-session web page recommendation, re-visitation classification, and goal-based web page grouping. A follow-up analysis further characterizes how the variety of human motives can affect the difference observed in human behavioral patterns.</p>

    <h3>Users in the Loop: A Psychologically-Informed Approach to Similar Item Retrieval (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amy A. Winecoff, Matthew Graham, Florin Brasoveanu, Pearce Washabaugh, Bryce Casavant</p>
    <p>Recommender systems (RS) often leverage information about the similarity between items’ features to make recommendations. Yet, many commonly used similarity functions make mathematical assumptions such as symmetry (i.e., Sim(a,b) = Sim(b,a)) that are inconsistent with how humans make similarity judgments. Moreover, most algorithm validations either do not directly measure users’ behavior or fail to comply with methodological standards for psychological research. RS that are developed and evaluated without regard to users’ psychology may fail to meet users’ needs. To provide recommendations that do meet the needs of users, we must: 1) develop similarity functions that account for known properties of human cognition, and 2) rigorously evaluate the performance of these functions using methodologically sound user testing. Here, we develop a framework for evaluating users’ judgments of similarity that is informed by best practices in psychological research methods. Employing users’ fashion item similarity judgments collected using our framework, we demonstrate that a psychologically-informed similarity function (i.e., Tversky contrast model) outperforms a psychologically-naive similarity function (i.e., Jaccard similarity) in predicting users’ similarity judgments.</p>

    <h3>Modeling the Assimilation-Contrast Effects in Online Product Rating Systems: Debiasing and Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junzhou Zhao, Xiaoying Zhang, John C.S. Lui</p>
    <p>The unbiasedness of online product ratings, an important property to ensure that users’ ratings indeed reflect their true evaluations to products, is vital both in shaping consumer purchase decisions and providing reliable recommendations. Recent experimental studies showed that distortions from historical ratings would ruin the unbiasedness of subsequent ratings. How to “discover” the distortions from historical ratings in each single rating (or at the micro-level), and perform the “de-biasing operations” in real rating systems are the main objectives of this work. Using 42 million real customer ratings, we first show that users either “assimilate” or “contrast” to historical ratings under different scenarios: users conform to historical ratings if historical ratings are not far from the product quality (assimilation), while users deviate from historical ratings if they are significantly different from the product quality (contrast). This phenomenon can be explained by the well-known psychological argument: the “Assimilate-Contrast” theory. However, none of the existing works on modeling historical ratings’ influence have taken this into account, and this motivates us to propose the Historical Influence Aware Latent Factor Model (HIALF), the first model for real rating systems to capture and mitigate historical distortions in each single rating. HIALF also allows us to study the influence patterns of historical ratings from a modeling perspective, and it perfectly matches the assimilation and contrast effects we previously observed. Also, HIALF achieves significant improvements in predicting subsequent ratings, and accurately predicts the relationships revealed in previous empirical measurements on real ratings. Finally, we show that HIALF can contribute to better recommendations by decoupling users’ real preference from distorted ratings, and reveal the intrinsic product quality for wiser consumer purchase decisions.</p>
