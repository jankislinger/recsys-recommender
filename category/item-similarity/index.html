    <h3>Of Spiky SVDs and Music Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darius Afchar, Romain Hennequin, Vincent Guigue</p>
    <p>The truncated singular value decomposition is a widely used methodology in music recommendation for direct similar-item retrieval or embedding musical items for downstream tasks. This paper investigates a curious effect that we show naturally occurring on many recommendation datasets: spiking formations in the embedding space. We first propose a metric to quantify this spiking organization’s strength, then mathematically prove its origin tied to underlying communities of items of varying internal popularity. With this new-found theoretical understanding, we finally open the topic with an industrial use case of estimating how music embeddings’ top-k similar items will change over time under the addition of data.</p>

    <h3>Data Masking for Recommender Systems: Prediction Performance and Rating Hiding (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martha Larson, Alan Hanjalic, Manel Slokom</p>
    <p>Data science challenges allow companies, and other data holders, to collaborate with the wider research community. In the area of recommender systems, the potential of such challenges to move forward the state of the art is limited due to concerns about releasing user interaction data. This paper investigates the potential of privacy-preserving data publishing for supporting recommender system challenges. We propose a data masking algorithm, Shuffle-NNN, with two steps: Neighborhood selection and value swapping. Neighborhood selection preserves valuable item similarity information. The data shuffling technique hides (ie, changes) ratings of users for individual items. Our experimental results demonstrate that the relative performance of algorithms, which is the key property that a data science challenge must measure, is comparable between the original data and the data masked with Shuffle-NNN.</p>

    <h3>Relaxed Softmax for PU Learning (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ugo Tanielian, Flavian Vasile</p>
    <p>In recent years, the softmax model and its fast approximations have become the de-facto loss functions for deep neural networks when dealing with multi-class prediction. This loss has been extended to language modeling and recommendation, two fields that fall into the framework of learning from Positive and Unlabeled data. In this paper, we stress the different drawbacks of the current family of softmax losses and sampling schemes when applied in a Positive and Unlabeled learning setup. We propose both a Relaxed Softmax loss (RS) and a new negative sampling scheme based on a Boltzmann formulation. We show that the new training objective is better suited for the tasks of density estimation, item similarity and next-event prediction by driving uplifts in performance on textual and recommendation datasets against classical softmax.</p>

    <h3>Item2vec: Neural Item Embedding for Collaborative Filtering (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oren Barkan, Noam Koenigstein</p>
    <p>Many Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms are item-based in the sense that they analyze item-item relations in order to produce item similarities. Recently, several works in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggested to learn a latent representation of words using neural embedding algorithms. Among them, the Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS), also known as Word2vec, was shown to provide state-of-the-art results on various linguistics tasks. In this paper, we show that item-based CF can be cast in the same framework of neural word embedding. Inspired by SGNS, we describe a method we name Item2vec for item-based CF that produces embedding for items in a latent space. The method is capable of inferring item-item relations even when user information is not available. We present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the Item2vec method and show it is competitive with SVD.</p>

    <h3>Cold-Start Item and User Recommendation with Decoupled Completion and Transduction (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farzan Masrour, Iman Barjasteh, Abdol-Hossein Esfahanian, Hayder Radha, Rana Forsati</p>
    <p>A major challenge in collaborative filtering based recommender systems is how to provide recommendations when rating data is sparse or entirely missing for a subset of users or items, commonly known as the problem. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in developing new solutions that address the cold-start problem. These solutions are mainly based on the idea of exploiting other sources of information to compensate for the lack of rating data. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework based on matrix factorization that simultaneously exploits the similarity information among users and items to alleviate the cold-start problem. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed algorithm the following two aspects of the cold-start problem: (a) the completion of a rating sub-matrix, which is generated by excluding cold-start users and items from the original rating matrix; and (b) the transduction of knowledge from existing ratings to cold-start items/users using side information. This crucial difference significantly boosts the performance when appropriate side information is incorporated. We provide theoretical guarantees on the estimation error of the proposed two-stage algorithm based on the richness of similarity information in capturing the rating data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that addresses the cold-start problem with provable guarantees. We also conduct thorough experiments on synthetic and real datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and highlights the usefulness of auxiliary information in dealing with both cold-start users and items.</p>
