    <h3>A New Perspective in Health Recommendations: Integration of Human Pose Estimation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaetano Dibenedetto</p>
    <p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in multimodal and multi-source data due to their ability to introduce heterogeneous information. Studies have demonstrated that combining such information enhances the performance of Recommender Systems across various scenarios. In the context of Health Recommendation Systems (HRS), different types of data are utilized, primarily focusing on patient-based information, but data from Pose Estimations (PE) are not incorporated. The objective of my Ph.D. is to investigate methods to design and develop HRS that treat the PE as one of the input sources, taking into account aspects such as privacy concerns and balancing the trade-off between system quality and responsiveness. By leveraging the combination of diverse information sources, I intend to create a new model in the area of HRS capable of providing more precise and explainable recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Reproducibility Analysis of Recommender Systems relying on Visual Features: traps, pitfalls, and countermeasures (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elio Musacchio, Marco Polignano, Antonio Silletti, Pasquale Lops, Giovanni Semeraro, Cataldo Musto</p>
    <p>Reproducibility is an important requirement for scientific progress, and the lack of reproducibility for a large amount of published research can hinder the progress over the state-of-the-art. This concerns several research areas, and recommender systems are witnessing the same reproducibility crisis. Even solid works published at prestigious venues might not be reproducible for several reasons: data might not be public, source code for recommendation algorithms might not be available or well documented, and evaluation metrics might be computed using parameters not explicitly provided. In addition, recommendation pipelines are becoming increasingly complex due to the use of deep neural architectures or representations for multimodal side information involving text, images, audio, or video. This makes the reproducibility of experiments even more challenging. In this work, we describe an extension of an already existing open-source recommendation framework, called ClayRS, with the aim of providing the foundation for future reproducibility of recommendation processes involving images as side information. This extension, called ClayRS Can See, is the starting point for reproducing state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms exploiting images. We have provided our implementation of one of these algorithms, namely VBPR â€“ Visual Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback, and we have discussed all the issues related to the reproducibility of the study to deeply understand the main traps and pitfalls, along with solutions to deal with such complex environments. We conclude the work by proposing a checklist for recommender systems reproducibility as a guide for the research community.</p>

    <h3>A Generative Model for Review-Based Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guy Uziel, Amir Kantor, Oren Sar Shalom</p>
    <p>User generated reviews is a highly informative source of information, that has recently gained lots of attention in the recommender systems community. In this work we propose a generative latent variable model that explains both observed ratings and textual reviews. This latent variable model allows to combine any traditional collaborative filtering method, together with any deep learning architecture for text processing. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate its superiority comparing to all baseline recommender systems. Furthermore, a running time analysis shows that this approach is in order of magnitude faster that relevant baselines. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>
