    <h3>Sequential User-based Recurrent Neural Network Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jürgen Ziegler, Tim Donkers, Benedikt Loepp</p>
    <p>Recurrent Neural Networks are powerful tools for modeling sequences. They are flexibly extensible and can incorporate various kinds of information including temporal order. These properties make them well suited for generating sequential recommendations. In this paper, we extend Recurrent Neural Networks by considering unique characteristics of the Recommender Systems domain. One of these characteristics is the explicit notion of the user recommendations are specifically generated for. We show how individual users can be represented in addition to sequences of consumed items in a new type of Gated Recurrent Unit to effectively produce personalized next item recommendations. Offline experiments on two real-world datasets indicate that our extensions clearly improve objective performance when compared to state-of-the-art recommender algorithms and to a conventional Recurrent Neural Network.</p>

    <h3>Personalizing Session-based Recommendations with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Cremonesi, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Balázs Hidasi, Massimo Quadrana</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendations are an important problem in many recommendation settings (e.g. e-commerce). Recurrent Neural Networks have recently been shown to perform very well in this setting. While in many session-based recommendation domains user identifiers are hard to come by there are also settings in which these profiles are readily available. We propose a seamless way to personalize RNN models with cross-session information and devise a hierarchical RNN model that transfers end evolves the hidden states of the RNN’s across user sessions. Results on two industry datasets show large improvements over the session-only RNN’s.</p>

    <h3>Modelling Contextual Information in Session-Aware Recommender Systems with Neural Networks (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bartłomiej Twardowski</p>
    <p>Preparing recommendations for unknown users or such that correctly respond to the short-term needs of a particular user is one of the fundamental problems for e-commerce. Most of the common Recommender Systems assume that user identification must be explicit. In this paper a Session-Aware Recommender System approach is presented where no straightforward user information is required. The recommendation process is based only on user activity within a single session, defined as a sequence of events. This information is incorporated in the recommendation process by explicit context modeling with factorization methods and a novel approach with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Compared to the session modeling approach, RNN directly models the dependency of user observed sequential behavior throughout its recurrent structure. The evaluation discusses the results based on sessions from real-life system with ephemeral items (identified only by the set of their attributes) for the task of top-n best recommendations.</p>
