    <h3>Predicting Online Performance of Job Recommender Systems With Offline Evaluation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrien Mogenet, Tuan Anh Nguyen Pham, Masahiro Kazama, Jialin Kong</p>
    <p>Recommender systems can be used to recommend jobs. In this context, implicit and explicit feedback signals we can collect are rare events, making the task of evaluation more complex. Online evaluation (A-B testing) is usually the most reliable way to measure the results from our experiments, but it is a slow process. In contrast, the offline evaluation process is faster, but it is critical to make it reliable as it informs our decision to roll out new improvements in production. In this paper, we review the comparative offline and online performances of three recommendations models, we describe the evaluation metrics we use and analyze how the offline performance metrics correlate with online metrics to understand how an offline evaluation process can be leveraged to inform the decisions. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Representation Learning for Homophilic Preferences (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hady W. Lauw, Trong T. Nguyen</p>
    <p>Users express their personal preferences through ratings, adoptions, and other consumption behaviors. We seek to learn latent representations for user preferences from such behavioral data. One representation learning model that has been shown to be effective for large preference datasets is Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). While homophily, or the tendency of friends to share their preferences at some level, is an established notion in sociology, thus far it has not yet been clearly demonstrated on RBM-based preference models. The question lies in how to appropriately incorporate social network into the architecture of RBM-based models for learning representations of preferences. In this paper, we propose two potential architectures: one that models social network among users as additional observations, and another that incorporates social network into the sharing of hidden units among related users. We study the efficacies of these proposed architectures on publicly available, real-life preference datasets with social networks, yielding useful insights.</p>
