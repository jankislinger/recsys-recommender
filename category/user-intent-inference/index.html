    <h3>MAWI Rec: Leveraging Severe Weather Data in Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Surya Kallumadi, Julian Mcauley, Brendan Duncan</p>
    <p>Inferring user intent in recommender systems can help performance but is difficult because intent is personal and not directly observable. Previous work has leveraged signals to stand as a proxy for intent (e.g. user interactions with resource pages), but such signals are not always available. In this paper, we instead recognize that certain events, which are observable, directly influence user intent. For example, after a flood, home improvement customers are more likely to undertake a renovation project to dry out their basement. We introduce MAWI Rec, a recommender system that leverages severe weather data to improve recommendation. Our weather-aware system achieves a significant improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline for online and in-store datasets of home improvement customers. This gain is most significant for weather-related product categories such as roof panels and flashings.</p>

    <h3>Using Navigation to Improve Recommendations in Real-Time (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander J Smola, Justin Basilico, Christopher V Alvino, Chao-Yuan Wu</p>
    <p>Implicit feedback is a key source of information for many recommendation and personalization approaches. However, using it typically requires multiple episodes of interaction and roundtrips to a recommendation engine. This adds latency and neglects the opportunity of immediate personalization for a user the user is navigating recommendations. We propose a novel strategy to address the above problem in a principled manner. The key insight is that as we observe a user’s interactions, it reveals much more information about her desires. We exploit this by inferring the within-session user intent based on navigation interactions, since they offer valuable clues into a user’s current state of mind. Using navigation patterns and adapting recommendations in real-time creates an opportunity to provide more accurate recommendations. By prefetching a larger amount of content, this can be carried out entirely in the client (such as a browser) without added latency. We define a new Bayesian model with an efficient inference algorithm. We demonstrate significant improvements with this novel approach on a real-world, large-scale dataset from Netflix on the problem of adapting the recommendations on a user’s homepage.</p>
