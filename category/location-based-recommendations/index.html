    <h3>Predicting User Routines with Masked Dilated Convolutions (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dragomir Yankov, Senthil Palanisamy, Renzhong Wang, Wei Wu, Siddhartha Arora, Michael R. Evans</p>
    <p>Predicting users daily location visits – when and where they will go, and how long they will stay – is key for making effective location-based recommendations. Knowledge of an upcoming day allows the suggestion of relevant alternatives (e.g., a new coffee shop on the way to work) in advance, prior to a visit. This helps users make informed decisions and plan accordingly. People’s visit routines, or just routines, can vary significantly from day to day, and visits from earlier in the day, week, or month may affect subsequent choices. Traditionally, routine prediction has been modeled with sequence methods, such as HMMs or more recently with RNN-based architectures. However, the problem with such architectures is that their predictive performance degrades when increasing the number of historical observations in the routine sequence. In this paper, we propose Masked-TCN (MTCN), a novel method based on time-dilated convolutional networks. The method implements custom dilations and masking which can process effectively long routine sequences, identifying recurring patterns at different resolution – hourly, daily, weekly, monthly. We demonstrate that MTCN achieves 8% improvement in accuracy over current state-of-the-art solutions on a large data set of visit routines. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>CLoSe: Contextualized Location Sequence Recommender (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramesh Baral, Sitharama Iyengar, Li Tao</p>
    <p>The location-based social networks (LBSN) (e.g., Facebook.com, etc.) have been explored heavily in the past decade for Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation. Many of the existing recommenders focus on recommending a single location or an arbitrary list of locations. In this paper, we propose a model termed CLoSe (Contextualized Location Sequence Recommender) that generates contextually coherent POI sequences relevant to user preferences. The POI sequence recommenders are helpful in many day-to-day activities, for e.g., itinerary planning, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to formulate contextual POI sequence recommendation by exploiting Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We incorporate check-in contexts to the hidden layer and global context to the hidden and output layers of RNN. We also demonstrate the efficiency of extended Long-short term memory (LSTM) in POI sequence generation. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) it exploits multi-context and personalized user preferences to formulate contextual POI sequence generation, (ii) it presents contextual extensions of RNN and LSTM that incorporate different contexts applicable to a POI and POI sequence generation, and (iii) it evaluates the proposed models with two real-world data sets.</p>

    <h3>Harnessing A Generalised User Behaviour Model for Next-POI Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Massimo, Francesco Ricci</p>
    <p>Recommender Systems (RSs) are commonly used in web applications to support users in finding items of their interest. In this paper we propose a novel RS approach to support human decision making by leveraging data acquired in the physical world. We focus on the tourism domain and we consider a scenario in which users’ choices, i.e., visit to points of interests (POIs), are tracked and used to generate recommendations for not yet visited POIs. We propose a novel approach to behaviour modelling that is based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). On top of this we propose two, non trivial, strategies for generating interesting recommendations, i.e., that differ from the straight next action prediction usually performed by state of the art models. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach outperforms state of the art models in terms of overall utility the user gains by following the provided recommendations and novelty of the newly recommended items.</p>

    <h3>CheckInShop.eu: A Sensor-based Recommender System for micro-location Marketing (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stergios Chairistanidis, Panagiotis Symeonidis</p>
    <p>CheckInShop is an app that employs sensors to capture the user preferences  in physical stores and provide either micro-location marketing or product recommendations. By utilizing iBeacon technology and with the exploitation of a mobile app, we keep track of customer’s preferences in physical stores. Then, based on the time that a product is viewed by a customer and his micro-location inside the store, we send to him either product offers or recommendations of similar products to the ones he is looking at. These recommendations are accurate because they are provided at the right time and in the right place.</p>

    <h3>Context-Aware Event Recommendation in Event-based Social Networks (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leandro B. Marinho, Rodrygo L. T. Santos, Augusto Q. Macedo</p>
    <p>The Web has grown into one of the most important channels to communicate social events nowadays. However, the sheer volume of events available in event-based social networks (EBSNs) often undermines the users’ ability to choose the events that best fit their interests. Recommender systems appear as a natural solution for this problem, but differently from classic recommendation scenarios (e.g. movies, books), the event recommendation problem is intrinsically cold-start. Indeed, events published in EBSNs are typically short-lived and, by definition, are always in the future, having little or no trace of historical attendance. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit several contextual signals available from EBSNs. In particular, besides content-based signals based on the events’ description and collaborative signals derived from users’ RSVPs, we exploit social signals based on group memberships, location signals based on the users’ geographical preferences, and temporal signals derived from the users’ time preferences. Moreover, we combine the proposed signals for learning to rank events for personalized recommendation. Thorough experiments using a large crawl of Meetup.com demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed contextual learning approach in contrast to state-of-the-art event recommenders from the literature.</p>

    <h3>Tackling Cold-Start Users in Recommender Systems with Indoor Positioning Systems (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joerg Simon, Emanuel Lacic, Dominik Kowald, Granit Luzhnica, Elisabeth Lex, Matthias Traub</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present work-in-progress on a recommender system based on Collaborative Filtering that exploits location information gathered by indoor positioning systems. This approach allows us to provide recommendations for “extreme” cold-start users with absolutely no item interaction data available, where methods based on Matrix Factorization would not work. We simulate and evaluate our proposed system using data from the location-based FourSquare system and show that we can provide substantially better recommender accuracy results than a simple MostPopular baseline that is typically used when no interaction data is available.</p>

    <h3>Tell Me Where to Go and What to Do Next, but Do Not Bother Me (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Liu, Gang Wu</p>
    <p>In this demonstration, we present a system that recommends to the user the locations and activities she/he might be interested in according to history GPS trajectories and public places of interest (POI) data. Its innovation lies in the acceptable performance of recommendations in cases where no user comments on activity types are available. Such situations are more realistic considering the restrictions on mobile devices' abilities, users' privacies, or business secret. For this purpose, we first extract stay points according to uses' trajectories, and label them with the top-k common activities which have the most possibility in terms of the POI dataset. Then, by taking stay points as observations, and activities as hidden states, a Hidden Markov model is built to learn the transfer possibilities between activities and the generation probabilities between activities and stay points. Finally, with the obtained model, our system can perform two types of recommendation, i.e. the history based recommendation and the similarity based recommendation. The results of former type are those stay points from user's own history positions. While, the latter one conducts collaborative filtering by taking history based recommendation results from similar users. The demonstration shows the running effects of the implemented prototype system, in which the Microsoft GeoLife trajectories dataset and the "DianPing.com" POI dataset were loaded. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate the feasibility.</p>
