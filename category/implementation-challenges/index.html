    <h3>Reproducibility and Analysis of Scientific Dataset Recommendation Methods (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianmaria Silvello, Matteo Lissandrini, Ornella Irrera, Daniele Dell’Aglio</p>
    <p>Datasets play a central role in scholarly communications. However, scholarly graphs are often incomplete, particularly due to the lack of connections between publications and datasets. Therefore, the importance of dataset recommendation—identifying relevant datasets for a scientific paper, an author, or a textual query—is increasing. Although various methods have been proposed for this task, their reproducibility remains unexplored, making it difficult to compare them with new approaches. We reviewed current recommendation methods for scientific datasets, focusing on the most recent and competitive approaches,  including an SVM-based model, a bi-encoder retriever, a method leveraging co-authors and citation network embeddings, and a heterogeneous variational graph autoencoder.  These approaches underwent a comprehensive analysis under consistent experimental conditions. Our reproducibility efforts show that three methods can be reproduced, while the graph variational autoencoder is challenging due to unavailable code and test datasets.  Hence, we re-implemented this method and performed a component-based analysis to examine its strengths and limitations. Furthermore, our study indicated that three out of four considered methods produce subpar results when applied to real-world data instead of specialized datasets with ad-hoc features.</p>

    <h3>Challenges in Translating Research to Practice for Evaluating Fairness and Bias in Recommendation Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan Taber, Lex Beattie, Henriette Cramer</p>
    <p>Calls to action to implement evaluation of fairness and bias into industry systems are increasing at a rapid rate. The research community has attempted to meet these demands by producing ethical principles and guidelines for AI, but few of these documents provide guidance on how to implement these principles in real world settings. Without readily available standardized and practice-tested approaches for evaluating fairness in recommendation systems, industry practitioners, who are often not experts, may easily run into challenges or implement metrics that are potentially poorly suited to their specific applications. When evaluating recommendations, practitioners are well aware they should evaluate their systems for unintended algorithmic harms, but the most important, and unanswered question, is how? In this talk, we will present practical challenges we encountered in addressing algorithmic responsibility in recommendation systems, which also present research opportunities for the RecSys community. This talk will focus on the steps that need to happen before bias mitigation can even begin.</p>

    <h3>Balancing relevance and discovery to inspire customers in the IKEA App (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Balazs Toth</p>
    <p>IKEA stores are designed to engage and inspire customers as they make their way from the entrance to check-out. To enable a great experience for every individual, our home-furnishing experts strive to provide the best possible input and advice, catering to individual needs and helping customers realise their vision for life at home.<br>As we move rapidly towards a multi touch point shopping vision with digital at heart, data and machine learning are crucial to 1) enable a consistent journey across, and 2) extend the domain expertise found in stores to our purely digital touch points, like the new IKEA App. A specific example of a digital product where we aim to inspire is our newly launched Inspirational Feed. In the Feed, customers browse their way through ”shoppable” images, in which our products are displayed in purposefully atmospheric settings for a wide range of room types. In this talk, we present our newest algorithmic approach to personalise the Feed based on contextual bandits [2, 3, 4], and highlight some of the technical challenges regarding implementation at scale.<br>The past decade has led to an explosion in research on recommender systems, often with personalised content as a motivating factor [1]. To identify a suitable class of algorithmic strategies for the Feed, note that: To capture the described trade-off between relevance and discovery, as well as matching data for how customers on average shop with IKEA, contextual bandits with batch learning from logged bandit feedback inspired by [4] have shown especially promising results among numerous other exploitation-exploration strategies. This approach induces a fair amount of exploration and minimizes the risk of showing irrelevant images to the customer based on the principle of counterfactual risk minimisation. In our contextual bandit setup, a bandit session is defined as a user session of the Feed taking place in the App (the home of the Feed). An action is displaying an image, while a reward is generated whenever the user clicks on it. The bandit context consists of previous user behaviour collected from the App, combined with product metadata. Our model takes advantage of embeddings of the input features, similar to [1].<br>The implementation of the strategy requires us to handle several interesting edge cases, e.g. we are looking into various techniques for increasing exploration as new images are added to our dynamic content catalogue.</p>
