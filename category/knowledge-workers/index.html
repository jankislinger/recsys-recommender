    <h3>Supporting Knowledge Workers through Personal Information Assistance with Context-aware Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahta Bakhshizadeh</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are extensively employed across various domains to mitigate information overload by providing personalized content. Despite their widespread use in sectors such as streaming, social networks, and e-commerce, utilizing them for personal information assistance is a comparatively novel application. This emerging application aims to develop intelligent systems capable of proactively providing knowledge workers with the most relevant information based on their context to enhance productivity. In this paper, we explore this innovative application by first defining the scope of our study, outlining the key objectives, and introducing main challenges. We then present our current results and progress, including a comprehensive literature review, the proposal of a framework, the collection of a pioneering dataset, and the establishment of a benchmark for evaluating a recommendation scenario on our published dataset. We also discuss our ongoing efforts and future research directions.</p>

    <h3>Context-based Entity Recommendation for Knowledge Workers: Establishing a Benchmark on Real-life Data (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahta Bakhshizadeh, Heiko Maus, Andreas Dengel</p>
    <p>In recent decades, recommender systems have undergone significant advancements, particularly in popular domains like movies, music, and product recommendations. Yet, progress has been notably slower in leveraging these systems for personal information management and knowledge assistance. In addition to challenges that complicate the adoption of recommender systems in this domain (such as privacy concerns, heterogeneous recommendation items, and frequent context switching), a significant barrier to progress in this area has been the absence of a standardized benchmark for researchers to evaluate their approaches. In response to this gap, this paper presents a benchmark built upon a publicly available dataset of real-life knowledge work in context (RLKWiC). This benchmark focuses on evaluating context-based entity recommendation, a use case for leveraging recommender systems to support knowledge workers in their daily digital tasks. By providing this benchmark, it is aimed to facilitate and accelerate research efforts in enhancing personal knowledge assistance through recommender systems.</p>
