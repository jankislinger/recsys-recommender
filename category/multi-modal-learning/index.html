    <h3>Multi-task Item-attribute Graph Pre-training for Strict Cold-start Item Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Peng, Zhiwei Liu, Chenyu You, Philip Yu, Liangwei Yang, Chen Wang, Yuwei Cao</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems suffer in the strict cold-start (SCS) scenario, where the user-item interactions are entirely unavailable. The well-established, dominating identity (ID)-based approaches completely fail to work. Cold-start recommenders, on the other hand, leverage item contents (brand, title, descriptions, etc.) to map the new items to the existing ones. However, the existing SCS recommenders explore item contents in coarse-grained manners that introduce noise or information loss. Moreover, informative data sources other than item contents, such as users’ purchase sequences and review texts, are largely ignored. In this work, we explore the role of the fine-grained item attributes in bridging the gaps between the existing and the SCS items and pre-train a knowledgeable item-attribute graph for SCS item recommendation. Our proposed framework, ColdGPT, models item-attribute correlations into an item-attribute graph by extracting fine-grained attributes from item contents. ColdGPT then transfers knowledge into the item-attribute graph from various available data sources, i.e., item contents, historical purchase sequences, and review texts of the existing items, via multi-task learning. To facilitate the positive transfer, ColdGPT designs specific submodules according to the natural forms of the data sources and proposes to coordinate the multiple pre-training tasks via unified alignment-and-uniformity losses. Our pre-trained item-attribute graph acts as an implicit, extendable item embedding matrix, which enables the SCS item embeddings to be easily acquired by inserting these items into the item-attribute graph and propagating their attributes’ embeddings. We carefully process three public datasets, i.e., Yelp, Amazon-home, and Amazon-sports, to guarantee the SCS setting for evaluation. Extensive experiments show that ColdGPT consistently outperforms the existing SCS recommenders by large margins and even surpasses models that are pre-trained on 75 – 224 times more, cross-domain data on two out of four datasets. Our code and pre-processed datasets for SCS evaluations are publicly available to help future SCS studies.</p>

    <h3>Deep Social Collaborative Filtering (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiliang Tang, Yao Ma, Dawei Yin, Jianping Wang, Wenqi Fan, Qing Li</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are crucial to alleviate the information overload problem in online worlds. Most of the modern recommender systems capture users’ preference towards items via their interactions based on collaborative filtering techniques. In addition to the user-item interactions, social networks can also provide useful information to understand users’ preference as suggested by the social theories such as homophily and influence. Recently, deep neural networks have been utilized for social recommendations, which facilitate both the user-item interactions and the social network information. However, most of these models cannot take full advantage of the social network information. They only use information from direct neighbors, but distant neighbors can also provide helpful information. Meanwhile, most of these models treat neighbors’ information equally without considering the specific recommendations. However, for a specific recommendation case, the information relevant to the specific item would be helpful. Besides, most of these models do not explicitly capture the neighbor’s opinions to items for social recommendations, while different opinions could affect the user differently. In this paper, to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose DSCF, a Deep Social Collaborative Filtering framework, which can exploit the social relations with various aspects for recommender systems. Comprehensive experiments on two-real world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

    <h3>User Preference Learning in Multi-criteria Recommendations using Stacked Auto Encoders (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bidyut Kr. Patra, Korra Sathya Babu, Dharahas Tallapally, Rama Syamala Sreepada</p>
    <p>Recommender System (RS) has been an essential component of many businesses, especially in e-commerce domain. RS exploits and processes the preference history (rating, purchase, review, etc.) of users in order to provide the recommendations. A user in traditional RS can provide only one rating value about an item. Deep Neural Networks have been used in this single rating system to improve recommendation accuracy in the recent times. However, the single rating systems are inadequate to understand the users’ preferences about an item. On the other hand, business enterprises such as tourism, e-learning, etc. facilitate users to provide multiple criteria ratings about an item, thus it becomes easier to understand users’ preference over single rating system. In this paper, we propose an extended Stacked Autoencoders (a Deep Neural Network technique) to utilize the multi-criteria ratings. The proposed network is designed to learn the relationship between each user’s criteria ratings and overall rating efficiently. Experimental results on real world datasets (Yahoo! Movies and TripAdvisor) demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art single rating systems and multi-criteria approaches on various performance metrics.</p>
