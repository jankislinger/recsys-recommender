    <h3>KRED: Knowledge-Aware Document Representation for News Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing Xie, Ying Qiao, Shiyin Wang, Guangzhong Sun, Jianxun Lian, Danyang Liu, Jiun-Hung Chen</p>
    <p>News articles usually contain knowledge entities such as celebrities or organizations. Important entities in articles carry key messages and help to understand the content in a more direct way. An industrial news recommender system contains various key applications, such as personalized recommendation, item-to-item recommendation, news category classification, news popularity prediction and local news detection. We find that incorporating knowledge entities for better document understanding benefits these applications consistently. However, existing document understanding models either represent news articles without considering knowledge entities (e.g., BERT) or rely on a specific type of text encoding model (e.g., DKN) so that the generalization ability and efficiency is compromised. In this paper, we propose KRED, which is a fast and effective model to enhance arbitrary document representation with a knowledge graph. KRED first enriches entities’ embeddings by attentively aggregating information from their neighborhood in the knowledge graph. Then a context embedding layer is applied to annotate the dynamic context of different entities such as frequency, category and position. Finally, an information distillation layer aggregates the entity embeddings under the guidance of the original document representation and transforms the document vector into a new one. We advocate to optimize the model with a multi-task framework, so that different news recommendation applications can be united and useful information can be shared across different tasks. Experiments on a real-world Microsoft News dataset demonstrate that KRED greatly benefits a variety of news recommendation applications.</p>

    <h3>Context-aware Graph Embedding for Session-based News Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heng-Shiou Sheu, Sheng Li</p>
    <p>Online news recommender systems aim to make personalized recommendations according to user preferences, which require modeling users’ short-term reading interest. However, due to the limited logged user interactions in practice, news recommendation at session-level becomes very challenging. Existing methods on session-based news recommendation mainly focus on extracting features from news articles and sequential user-item interactions, but they usually ignore the semantic-level structural information among news articles and do not explore external knowledge sources. In this paper, we propose a novel Context-Aware Graph Embedding (CAGE) framework for session-based news recommendation, which builds an auxiliary knowledge graph to enrich the semantic meaning of entities involved in articles, and further refines the article embeddings by graph convolutional networks. Experimental results on a real-world news dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods on session-based news recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Ensemble Contextual Bandits for Personalized Recommendation (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Li, Lei Li, Yexi Jiang, Liang Tang</p>
    <p>The cold-start problem has attracted extensive attention among various online services that provide personalized recommendation. Many online vendors employ contextual bandit strategies to tackle the so-called exploration/exploitation dilemma rooted from the cold-start problem. However, due to high-dimensional user/item features and the underlying characteristics of bandit policies, it is often difficult for service providers to obtain and deploy an appropriate algorithm to achieve acceptable and robust economic profit. In this paper, we explore ensemble strategies of multiple contextual bandit algorithms to obtain robust predicted click-through rate (CTR) of web objects. Specifically, the ensemble is acquired by aggregating different pulling policies of bandit algorithms, rather than forcing the agreement of prediction results or learning a unified predictive model. To this end, we employ a meta-bandit paradigm that places a hyper bandit over the base bandits, to explicitly explore/exploit the relative importance of base bandits based on user feedbacks. Extensive empirical experiments on two real-world data sets (news recommendation and online advertising) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of CTR.</p>
