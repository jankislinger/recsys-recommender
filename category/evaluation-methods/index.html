    <h3>Why the Shooting in the Dark Method Dominates Recommender Systems Practice (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Rohde</p>
    <p>The introduction of A/B Testing represented a great leap forward in recommender systems research. Like the randomized control trial for evaluating drug efficacy; A/B Testing has equipped recommender systems practitioners with a protocol for measuring performance as defined by actual business metrics and with minimal assumptions. While A/B testing provided a way to measure the performance of two or more candidate systems, it provides no guide for determining what policy we should test. The focus of this industry talk is to better understand, why the development of A/B testing was the last great leap forward in the development of reward optimizing recommender systems despite more than a decade of efforts in both industry and academia. The talk will survey: industry best practice, standard theories and tools including: collaborative filtering (MovieLens RecSys), contextual bandits, attribution, off-policy estimation, causal inference, click through rate models and will explain why we have converged on a fundamentally heuristic solution or guess and check type method. The talk will offer opinions about which of these theories are useful, and which are not and make a concrete proposal to make progress based on a non-standard use of deep learning tools.</p>

    <h3>KGGLM: A Generative Language Model for Generalizable Knowledge Graph Representation Learning in Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Soccol, Giacomo Balloccu, Gianni Fenu, Mirko Marras, Ludovico Boratto</p>
    <p>Current recommendation methods based on knowledge graphs rely on entity and relation representations for several steps along the pipeline, with knowledge completion and path reasoning being the most influential. Despite their similarities, the most effective representation methods for these steps differ, leading to inefficiencies, limited representativeness, and reduced interpretability. In this paper, we introduce KGGLM, a decoder-only Transformer model designed for generalizable knowledge representation learning to support recommendation. The model is trained on generic paths sampled from the knowledge graph to capture foundational patterns, and then fine-tuned on paths specific of the downstream step (knowledge completion and path reasoning in our case). Experiments on ML1M and LFM1M show that KGGLM beats twenty-two baselines in effectiveness under both knowledge completion and recommendation. Source code and pre-processed data sets are available at https://github.com/mirkomarras/kgglm.</p>

    <h3>Evaluating the Pros and Cons of Recommender Systems Explanations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kathrin Wardatzky</p>
    <p>Despite the growing interest in explainable AI in the RecSys community, the evaluation of explanations is still an open research topic. Typically, explanations are evaluated using offline metrics, with a case study, or through a user study. In my research, I will have a closer look at the evaluation of the effects of explanations on users. I investigate two possible factors that can impact the effects reported in recent publications, namely the explanation design and content as well as the users themselves. I further address the problem of determining promising explanations for an application scenario from a seemingly endless pool of options. Lastly, I propose a user study to close some of the research gaps established in the surveys and investigate how recommender systems explanations impact the understanding of users with different backgrounds.</p>

    <h3>One-class Matrix Factorization: Point-Wise Regression-Based or Pair-Wise Ranking-Based? (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Wei Chen, Chih-Jen Lin</p>
    <p>One-class matrix factorization (MF) is an important technique for recommender systems with implicit feedback. In one widely used setting, a regression function is fit in a point-wise manner on observed and some unobserved (user, item) entries. Recently, in AAAI 2019, Chen et al. [2] proposed a pair-wise ranking-based approach for observed (user, item) entries to be compared against unobserved ones. They concluded that the pair-wise setting performs consistently better than the more traditional point-wise setting. However, after some detailed investigation, we explain by mathematical derivations that their method may perform only similar to the point-wise ones. We also identified some problems when reproducing their experimental results. After considering suitable settings, we rigorously compare point-wise and pair-wise one-class MFs, and show that the pair-wise method is actually not better. Therefore, for one-class MF, the more traditional and mature point-wise setting should still be considered. Our findings contradict the conclusions in [2] and serve as a call for caution when researchers are comparing between two machine learning methods.</p>

    <h3>Fairness and Transparency in Music Recommender Systems: Improvements for Artists (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karlijn Dinnissen</p>
    <p>Music streaming services have become one of the main sources of music consumption in the last decade, with recommender systems as an important component. As those systems partially decide the songs that music consumers listen to, the systems greatly impact the artists who created the songs. However, when evaluating performance and fairness of these music recommending systems (MRSs), the perspective of the item providers or other music industry professionals is often not considered. Additionally, artists indicate they would appreciate more transparency – both towards and users and the artists themselves – regarding why certain items are recommended and others are not. This research project takes a multi-stakeholder approach to bridge the gap between music systems and their item providers. We first establish artists’ and music industry professionals’ perspective on MRSs through interviews and questionnaires. Based on those insights, we then aim to increase matching between end users and lesser-known artists by generating rich item and user representations. Results will be evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. Lastly, we plan to effectively communicate MRS fairness by increasing transparency for both end users and artists.</p>

    <h3>Embedding based retrieval for long tail search queries in ecommerce (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arun Udayashankar, Yuyang Zhang, Akshay Kekuda</p>
    <p>In this abstract we present a series of optimizations we performed on the two-tower model architecture [14], and training and evaluation datasets to implement semantic product search at Best Buy. Search queries on bestbuy.com follow the pareto distribution whereby a minority of them account for most searches. This leaves us with a long tail of search queries that have low frequency of issuance. The queries in the long tail suffer from very spare interaction signals. Our current work focuses on building a model to serve the long tail queries. We present a series of optimizations we have done to this model to maximize conversion for the purpose of retrieval from the catalog. The first optimization we present is using a large language model to improve the sparsity of conversion signals. The second optimization is pretraining an off-the-shelf transformer-based model on the Best Buy catalog data. The third optimization we present is on the finetuning front. We use query-to-query pairs in addition to query-to-product pairs and combining the above strategies for finetuning the model. We also demonstrate how merging the weights of these finetuned models improves the evaluation metrics. Finally, we provide a recipe for curating an evaluation dataset for continuous monitoring of model performance with human-in-the-loop evaluation. We found that adding this recall mechanism to our current term match-based recall improved conversion by 3% in an online A/B test.</p>

    <h3>Not All Videos Become Outdated: Short-Video Recommendation by Learning to Deconfound Release Interval Bias (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aixin Sun, Guoxiu He, Lulu Dong</p>
    <p>Short-video recommender systems often exhibit a biased preference to recently released videos. However, not all videos become outdated; certain classic videos can still attract user’s attention. Such bias along temporal dimension can be further aggravated by the matching model between users and videos, because the model learns from preexisting interactions. From real data, we observe that different videos have varying sensitivities to recency in attracting users’ attention. Our analysis, based on a causal graph modeling short-video recommendation, suggests that the release interval serves as a confounder, establishing a backdoor path between users and videos. To address this confounding effect, we propose a model-agnostic causal architecture called Learning to Deconfound the Release Interval Bias (LDRI). LDRI enables jointly learning of the matching model and the video recency sensitivity perceptron. In the inference stage, we apply a backdoor adjustment, effectively blocking the backdoor path by intervening on each video. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that LDRI consistently outperforms backbone models and exhibits superior performance against state-of-the-art models. Additional comprehensive analyses confirm the deconfounding capability of LDRI. Our code is available online: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LDRI/.</p>

    <h3>Playlist Search Reinvented: LLMs Behind the Curtain (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tarun Sharma, Siddharth Sharma, Geetha Aluri, Joaquin Delgado</p>
    <p>Improving search functionality poses challenges such as data scarcity for model training, metadata enrichment for comprehensive document indexing, and the labor-intensive manual annotation for evaluation. Traditionally, iterative methods relying on human annotators and customer feedback have been used. However, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new solutions. This paper focuses on applying LLMs to playlist search in Amazon Music. Leveraging LLMs’ contextual understanding and generative capabilities automates metadata enrichment, reducing manual efforts and expediting training. LLMs also address data scarcity by generating synthetic training data and serve as scalable judges for evaluation, enhancing search performance assessment. We demonstrate how these innovations enhance playlist search, overcoming traditional limitations to improve search result accuracy and relevance.</p>

    <h3>Reproducibility and Analysis of Scientific Dataset Recommendation Methods (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianmaria Silvello, Matteo Lissandrini, Ornella Irrera, Daniele Dell’Aglio</p>
    <p>Datasets play a central role in scholarly communications. However, scholarly graphs are often incomplete, particularly due to the lack of connections between publications and datasets. Therefore, the importance of dataset recommendation—identifying relevant datasets for a scientific paper, an author, or a textual query—is increasing. Although various methods have been proposed for this task, their reproducibility remains unexplored, making it difficult to compare them with new approaches. We reviewed current recommendation methods for scientific datasets, focusing on the most recent and competitive approaches,  including an SVM-based model, a bi-encoder retriever, a method leveraging co-authors and citation network embeddings, and a heterogeneous variational graph autoencoder.  These approaches underwent a comprehensive analysis under consistent experimental conditions. Our reproducibility efforts show that three methods can be reproduced, while the graph variational autoencoder is challenging due to unavailable code and test datasets.  Hence, we re-implemented this method and performed a component-based analysis to examine its strengths and limitations. Furthermore, our study indicated that three out of four considered methods produce subpar results when applied to real-world data instead of specialized datasets with ad-hoc features.</p>

    <h3>Taming the One-Epoch Phenomenon in Online Recommendation System by Two-stage Contrastive ID Pre-training (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chantat Eksombatchai, Jiajing Xu, Yi-Ping Hsu, Po-Wei Wang</p>
    <p>ID-based embeddings are widely used in web-scale online recommendation systems. However, their susceptibility to overfitting, particularly due to the long-tail nature of data distributions, often limits training to a single epoch, a phenomenon known as the “one-epoch problem.” This challenge has driven research efforts to optimize performance within the first epoch by enhancing convergence speed or feature sparsity. In this study, we introduce a novel two-stage training strategy that incorporates a pre-training phase using a minimal model with contrastive loss, enabling broader data coverage for the embedding system. Our offline experiments demonstrate that multi-epoch training during the pre-training phase does not lead to overfitting, and the resulting embeddings improve online generalization when fine-tuned for more complex downstream recommendation tasks. We deployed the proposed system in live traffic at Pinterest, achieving significant site-wide engagement gains.</p>

    <h3>Integrating Matrix Factorization with Graph based Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rachana Mehta</p>
    <p>Graph based Recommender models make use of user-item rating and user-user social relationships to elicit recommendation performance by extracting inherent geometrical knowledge. In a social graph scenario, user-user trust plays a significant role in reducing sparsity and has varied characteristics that can be exploited. Existing models limit themselves to learning from either a high order interaction graph of user-item ratings or a user-user social graph from trust value. They explore other trust characteristics in a very limited setting. The graph based model, designed using entire user-user social information, impacts performance and escalates complexities in model learning. To alleviate these issues of graph learning, graph recommender seeks assistance from matrix factorization techniques. Incorporating graph based model with matrix factorization brings its own set of challenges of model integration, leveraging trust, graph learning, and optimization. This article presents the existing work in that line and future possibilities and challenges to be catered to through novel developments</p>

    <h3>A Dataset for Adapting Recommender Systems to the Fashion Rental Economy (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jivitesh Sharma, Karl Audun Borgersen, Morten Goodwin, Morten Grundetjern</p>
    <p>In response to the escalating ecological challenges that threaten global sustainability, there’s a deep need to investigate alternative methods of commerce, such as rental economies. Like most online commerce, rental or otherwise, a functioning recommender system is crucial for their success. Yet the domain has, until this point, been largely neglected by the recommender system research community. Our dataset, derived from our collaboration with the leading Norwegian fashion rental company [Company name omitted for review process], encompasses 64k transactions, rental histories from 2.2k anonymized users, and 15.8k unique outfits in which each physical item’s attributes and rental history is meticulously tracked. All outfits are listed as individual items or their corresponding item groups, referring to shared designs between the individual items. This approach underlines the novel challenges of rental as compared to more traditional recommender system problems where items are generally interchangeable. Each outfit is accompanied by a set of tags describing some of their attributes. We also provide a total of 50k images displaying across all items along with a set of precomputed zero-shot embeddings. We apply a myriad of common recommender system methods to the dataset to provide a performance baseline. This baseline is performed for the traditional fashion recommender system problem of recommending outfit groups and the novel problem of predicting individual item rental. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset discussing the domain of clothes rental. It is our hope that the publication of this dataset will serve as a catalyst for a new branch of research for specialized fashion rental recommender systems. The dataset is temporarily hosted at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/clothes_rental_dataset-B1E8/ and Google Cloud at https: //console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/clothes-rental-dataset The code for collecting, processing, and evaluating the dataset is hosted at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Vibrent_Dataset_Collection-03DC/</p>

    <h3>Comparative Analysis of Pretrained Audio Representations in Music Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan-Martin Tamm, Anna Aljanaki</p>
    <p>Over the years, Music Information Retrieval (MIR) has proposed various foundation models pretrained on large amounts of music data. Transfer learning showcases proven effectiveness of foundation models with a broad spectrum of downstream tasks, including auto-tagging and genre classification. However, MIR papers generally do not explore the efficiency of foundation models for Music Recommender Systems (MRS). In addition, the Recommender Systems (RS) community tends to favour traditional end-to-end neural network learning over these models. Our research addresses this gap and evaluates the applicability of six pretrained foundation models (MusicFM, Music2Vec, MERT, EncodecMAE, Jukebox, and MusiCNN) in the context of MRS. We assess their performance using three recommendation models: K-nearest neighbours (KNN), shallow neural network, and BERT4Rec. Our findings suggest that these models exhibit significant performance variability between traditional MIR tasks and MRS, indicating that valuable aspects of musical information captured by foundation models may differ depending on the task. This study establishes a foundation for further exploration of pretrained foundation models to enhance music recommendation systems.</p>

    <h3>How to Evaluate Serendipity in Recommender Systems: the Need for a Serendiptionnaire (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brett Binst</p>
    <p>Recommender systems can assist in various user tasks and serve diverse values, including exploring the item space. Serendipity has recently received considerable attention, often seen as a way to broaden users’ tastes and counteract filter bubbles. However, the field of research on serendipity is fragmented regarding its evaluation methods, which impedes the progress of knowledge accumulation. This research plan proposes two studies to address these issues. First, a systematic literature review will be conducted to provide insights into how serendipity is currently studied in the field. This review will serve as a reference for novice researchers and help mitigate fragmentation by presenting a thorough overview of the field. This systematic literature review has already revealed a significant gap: the lack of a validated, widely accepted method for evaluating serendipity. Therefore, the second part of this research plan is to develop a validated questionnaire, the serendiptionnaire, to measure serendipity. This tool will provide a ground truth for evaluating serendipity, aiding in answering fundamental questions within the field and validating offline metrics.</p>

    <h3>Multi-Objective Recommendation via Multivariate Policy Learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Potapov, Sourabh Vaid, Wenzhe Shi, Nakul Agarwal, Olivier Jeunen, Jatin Mandav, Aleksei Ustimenko</p>
    <p>Real-world recommender systems often need to balance multiple objectives when deciding which recommendations to present to users. These include behavioural signals (e.g. clicks, shares, dwell time), as well as broader objectives (e.g. diversity, fairness). Scalarisation methods are commonly used to handle this balancing task, where a weighted average of per-objective reward signals determines the final score used for ranking. Naturally, <i>how</i> these weights are computed exactly, is key to success for any online platform. We frame this as a decision-making task, where the scalarisation weights are <i>actions</i> taken to maximise an overall North Star reward (e.g. long-term user retention or growth). We extend existing policy learning methods to the continuous multivariate action domain, proposing to maximise a pessimistic lower bound on the North Star reward that the learnt policy will yield. Typical lower bounds based on normal approximations suffer from insufficient coverage, and we propose an efficient and effective policy-dependent correction for this. We provide guidance to design stochastic data collection policies, as well as highly sensitive reward signals.
