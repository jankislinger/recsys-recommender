    <h3>Recommender-Systems.com: A Central Platform for the Recommender-System Community (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joeran Beel</p>
    <p>We introduce Recommender-Systems.com (RS_c) as a central platform for the recommender-systems community. RS_c provides regular news on important events in the community as well as curated lists of recommender-system resources including datasets, algorithms, jobs, software, and learning materials. Based on a survey with 28 participants – mostly authors at the RecSys 2019 conference – 91% agree that RS_c could be a major contribution to the community. Participants consider it currently particularly difficult to find best practice guidelines (45%); researchers, freelancers and employers (45%); and curated lists of state-of-the-art algorithms, software, and datasets (36%). Notably, only 19% consider it (very) easy to find material relating to diversity, equality and anti-discrimination.</p>

    <h3>PrivateJobMatch: A Privacy-Oriented Deferred Multi-Match Recommender System for Stable Employment (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amar Saini, Florin Rusu, Andrew Johnston</p>
    <p>Coordination failure reduces match quality among employers and candidates in the job market, resulting in a large number of unfilled positions and/or unstable, short-term employment. Centralized job search engines provide a platform that connects directly employers with job-seekers. However, they require users to disclose a significant amount of personal data, i.e., build a user profile, in order to provide meaningful recommendations. In this paper, we present PrivateJobMatch — a privacy-oriented deferred multi-match recommender system — which generates stable pairings while requiring users to provide only a partial ranking of their preferences. PrivateJobMatch explores a series of adaptations of the game-theoretic Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm which combine the flexibility of decentralized markets with the intelligence of centralized matching. We identify the shortcomings of the original algorithm when applied to a job market and propose novel solutions that rely on machine learning techniques. Experimental results on real and synthetic data confirm the benefits of the proposed algorithms across several quality measures. Over the past year, we have implemented a PrivateJobMatch prototype and deployed it in an active job market economy. Using the gathered real-user preference data, we find that the match recommendations are superior to a typical decentralized job market—while requiring only a partial ranking of the user preferences.</p>
