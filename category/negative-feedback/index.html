    <h3>Enhancing Sequential Music Recommendation with Negative Feedback-informed Contrastive Learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahrzad Shashaani, Pavan Seshadri, Peter Knees</p>
    <p>Modern music streaming services are heavily based on recommen- dation engines to serve continuous content to users. Sequential recommendation—continuously providing new items within a sin- gle session in a contextually coherent manner—has been an emerg- ing topic in current literature. User feedback—a positive or negative response to the item presented—is used to drive content recom- mendations by learning user preferences. We extend this idea to the session-based recommendation domain to improve learning of context-coherent music recommendations by modelling negative user feedback, i.e., skips, in the loss function. To this end, we propose a sequence-aware contrastive sub-task to structure item embeddings in session-based music recommen- dation, such that true next-positive items (ignoring skipped items) are structured closer in the embedding space, while skipped tracks are structured farther away from all items in the session. Since this causes skipped item embeddings in a session to be farther than unskipped items in the learned space, this directly affects item rankings using a K-nearest-neighbors search for next-item recom- mendations, while also promoting the rank of the true next item. Experiments incorporating this task into SoTA methods for sequen- tial item recommendation show consistent performance gains in terms of next-item hit rate, item ranking, and skip down-ranking on three music recommendation datasets, strongly benefiting from increasing presence of user feedback.</p>

    <h3>Learning From Negative User Feedback and Measuring Responsiveness for Sequential Recommenders (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuo Chang, Yueqi Wang, Elaine Ya Le, Shane Li, Yaping Zhang, Xujian Liang, Yoni Halpern, Shuchao Bi, Longfei Li, Jingchen Feng, Min-Cheng Huang, Alex Beutel</p>
    <p>Sequential recommenders have been widely used in industry due to their strength in modeling user preferences. While these models excel at learning a user’s positive interests, less attention has been paid to learn from negative user feedback. Negative user feedback is an important lever of user control, and comes with an expectation that recommenders should respond quickly and reduce similar recommendations to the user. However, negative feedback signals are often ignored in the training objective of sequential recommenders, which primarily aim at predicting positive user interactions. In this work, we incorporate explicit and implicit negative user feedback into the training objective of sequential recommenders using a “not-to-recommend” loss function that optimizes for the log likelihood of not recommending items with negative feedback. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using live experiments on a large-scale industrial recommender system. Furthermore, we address a challenge in measuring recommender responsiveness to negative feedback by developing a counterfactual simulation framework to compare recommender responses between different user actions, showing improved responsiveness from the modeling change.</p>

    <h3>Fifty Shades of Ratings: How to Benefit from a Negative Feedback in Top-N Recommendations Tasks (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evgeny Frolov, Ivan Oseledets</p>
    <p>Conventional collaborative filtering techniques treat a top-n recommendations problem as a task of generating a list of the most relevant items. This formulation, however, disregards an opposite — avoiding recommendations with completely irrelevant items. Due to that bias, standard algorithms, as well as commonly used evaluation metrics, become insensitive to negative feedback. In order to resolve this problem we propose to treat user feedback as a categorical variable and model it with users and items in a ternary way. We employ a third-order tensor factorization technique and implement a higher order folding-in method to support online recommendations. The method is equally sensitive to entire spectrum of user ratings and is able to accurately predict relevant items even from a negative only feedback. Our method may partially eliminate the need for complicated rating elicitation process as it provides means for personalized recommendations from the very beginning of an interaction with a recommender system. We also propose a modification of standard metrics which helps to reveal unwanted biases and account for sensitivity to a negative feedback. Our model achieves state-of-the-art quality in standard recommendation tasks while significantly outperforming other methods in the cold-start “no-positive-feedback” scenarios.</p>
