    <h3>Towards Safety and Sustainability: Designing Local Recommendations for Post-pandemic World (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niloy Ganguly, Gourab K Patro, Ashmi Banerjee, Abhijnan Chakraborty</p>
    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has made it paramount to maintain social distance to limit the viral transmission probability. At the same time, local businesses (e.g., restaurants, cafes, stores, malls) need to operate to ensure their economic sustainability. Considering the wide usage of local recommendation platforms like Google Local and Yelp by customers to choose local businesses, we propose to design local recommendation systems which can help in achieving both safety and sustainability goals. Our investigation of existing local recommendation systems shows that they can lead to overcrowding at some businesses compromising customer safety, and very low footfall at other places threatening their economic sustainability. On the other hand, naive ways of ensuring safety and sustainability can cause significant loss in recommendation utility for the customers. Thus, we formally express the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and solve by innovatively mapping it to a bipartite matching problem with polynomial time solutions. Extensive experiments over multiple real-world datasets reveal the efficacy of our approach along with the three-way control over sustainability, safety, and utility goals.</p>

    <h3>Optimally Balancing Receiver and Recommended Users’ Importance in Reciprocal Recommender Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Ricci, Rosenfeld Ariel, Akiva Kleinerman, Sarit Kraus</p>
    <p>Online platforms which assist people in finding a suitable partner or match, such as online dating and job recruiting environments, have become increasingly popular in the last decade. Many of these platforms include recommender systems which aim to help users discover other people who will be also interested in them. These recommender systems benefit from contemplating the interest of both sides of the recommended match, however the question of how to optimally balance the interest and the response of both sides remains open. In this study we present a novel recommendation method for recommending people to people. For each user receiving a recommendation, our method finds the optimal balance of two criteria: a) the user’s likelihood to accept the recommendation; and b) the recommended user’s likelihood to positively respond. We extensively evaluate our recommendation method with a group of active users from an operational online dating site. We find that our method is significantly more effective in increasing the number of successful interactions compared to a current state-of-the-art recommendation method.</p>
