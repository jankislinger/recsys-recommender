    <h3>Toward 100TB Recommendation Models with Embedding Offloading (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sarunya Pumma, Levy Zhao, Joshua Deng, Dennis Van Der Staay, Jian He, Intaik Park, Ehsan Ardestani, Damian Reeves, Yu Guo, Paul Zhang, Henry Tsang</p>
    <p>Training recommendation models become memory-bound with large embedding tables, and fast GPU memory is scarce. In this paper, we explore embedding caches and prefetch pipelines to effectively leverage large but slow host memory for embedding tables. We introduce Locality-Aware Sharding and iterative planning that automatically size caches optimally and produce effective sharding plans. Embedding Offloading, a system that combines all of these components and techniques, is implemented on top of Meta’s open-source libraries, FBGEMM GPU and TorchRec, and it is used to improve scalability and efficiency of industry-scale production models. Embedding Offloading achieved 37x model scale to 100TB model size with only 26% training speed regression.</p>

    <h3>TinyKG: Memory-Efficient Training Framework for Knowledge Graph Neural Recommender Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Yang, Xia Hu, Chin-Chia Michael Yeh, Huiyuan Chen, Xiaoting Li, Kaixiong Zhou, Yan Zheng</p>
    <p>There has been an explosion of interest in designing various Knowledge Graph Neural Networks (KGNNs), which achieve state-of-the-art performance and provide great explainability for recommendation. The promising performance is mainly resulting from their capability of capturing high-order proximity messages over the knowledge graphs. However, training KGNNs at scale is challenging due to the high memory usage. In the forward pass, the automatic differentiation engines (e.g., TensorFlow/PyTorch) generally need to cache all intermediate activation maps in order to compute gradients in the backward pass, which leads to a large GPU memory footprint. Existing work solves this problem by utilizing multi-GPU distributed frameworks. Nonetheless, this poses a practical challenge when seeking to deploy KGNNs in memory-constrained environments, especially for industry-scale graphs.<br>Here we present TinyKG, a memory-efficient GPU-based training framework for KGNNs for the tasks of recommendation. Specifically, TinyKG uses exact activations in the forward pass while storing a quantized version of activations in the GPU buffers. During the backward pass, these low-precision activations are dequantized back to full-precision tensors, in order to compute gradients. To reduce the quantization errors, TinyKG applies a simple yet effective quantization algorithm to compress the activations, which ensures unbiasedness with low variance. As such, the training memory footprint of KGNNs is largely reduced with negligible accuracy loss. To evaluate the performance of our TinyKG, we conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets. We found that our TinyKG with INT2 quantization aggressively reduces the memory footprint of activation maps with 7 ×, only with 2% loss in accuracy, allowing us to deploy KGNNs on memory-constrained devices.</p>
