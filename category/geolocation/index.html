    <h3>Predicting User Routines with Masked Dilated Convolutions (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dragomir Yankov, Senthil Palanisamy, Renzhong Wang, Wei Wu, Siddhartha Arora, Michael R. Evans</p>
    <p>Predicting users daily location visits – when and where they will go, and how long they will stay – is key for making effective location-based recommendations. Knowledge of an upcoming day allows the suggestion of relevant alternatives (e.g., a new coffee shop on the way to work) in advance, prior to a visit. This helps users make informed decisions and plan accordingly. People’s visit routines, or just routines, can vary significantly from day to day, and visits from earlier in the day, week, or month may affect subsequent choices. Traditionally, routine prediction has been modeled with sequence methods, such as HMMs or more recently with RNN-based architectures. However, the problem with such architectures is that their predictive performance degrades when increasing the number of historical observations in the routine sequence. In this paper, we propose Masked-TCN (MTCN), a novel method based on time-dilated convolutional networks. The method implements custom dilations and masking which can process effectively long routine sequences, identifying recurring patterns at different resolution – hourly, daily, weekly, monthly. We demonstrate that MTCN achieves 8% improvement in accuracy over current state-of-the-art solutions on a large data set of visit routines. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Event Recommendation using Twitter Activity (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deepa Mallela, Axel Magnuson, Vijay Dialani</p>
    <p>User interactions with Twitter (social network) frequently take place on mobile devices – a user base that it strongly caters to. As much of Twitter’s traffic comes with geotagging information associated with it, it is a natural platform for geographic recommendations. This paper proposes an event recommender system for Twitter users, which identifies twitter activity co-located with previous events, and uses it to drive geographic recommendations via item-based collaborative filtering.</p>

    <h3>Tell Me Where to Go and What to Do Next, but Do Not Bother Me (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Liu, Gang Wu</p>
    <p>In this demonstration, we present a system that recommends to the user the locations and activities she/he might be interested in according to history GPS trajectories and public places of interest (POI) data. Its innovation lies in the acceptable performance of recommendations in cases where no user comments on activity types are available. Such situations are more realistic considering the restrictions on mobile devices' abilities, users' privacies, or business secret. For this purpose, we first extract stay points according to uses' trajectories, and label them with the top-k common activities which have the most possibility in terms of the POI dataset. Then, by taking stay points as observations, and activities as hidden states, a Hidden Markov model is built to learn the transfer possibilities between activities and the generation probabilities between activities and stay points. Finally, with the obtained model, our system can perform two types of recommendation, i.e. the history based recommendation and the similarity based recommendation. The results of former type are those stay points from user's own history positions. While, the latter one conducts collaborative filtering by taking history based recommendation results from similar users. The demonstration shows the running effects of the implemented prototype system, in which the Microsoft GeoLife trajectories dataset and the "DianPing.com" POI dataset were loaded. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate the feasibility.</p>

    <h3>Content Ordering Based On Commuting Patterns (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Alonso, Travis Gingerich</p>
    <p>Recommender systems take into account a wide range of information about both an individual user and other user's preferences in order to provide relevant content. However, one source of information that appears to be under-utilized is contextual information about the users' trajectory: where they are currently located, and where they are traveling to. We demonstrate a system that recommends the reading order of Twitter content based on the user's planned travel.</p>
