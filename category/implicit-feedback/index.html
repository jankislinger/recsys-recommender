    <h3>One-class Matrix Factorization: Point-Wise Regression-Based or Pair-Wise Ranking-Based? (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Wei Chen, Chih-Jen Lin</p>
    <p>One-class matrix factorization (MF) is an important technique for recommender systems with implicit feedback. In one widely used setting, a regression function is fit in a point-wise manner on observed and some unobserved (user, item) entries. Recently, in AAAI 2019, Chen et al. [2] proposed a pair-wise ranking-based approach for observed (user, item) entries to be compared against unobserved ones. They concluded that the pair-wise setting performs consistently better than the more traditional point-wise setting. However, after some detailed investigation, we explain by mathematical derivations that their method may perform only similar to the point-wise ones. We also identified some problems when reproducing their experimental results. After considering suitable settings, we rigorously compare point-wise and pair-wise one-class MFs, and show that the pair-wise method is actually not better. Therefore, for one-class MF, the more traditional and mature point-wise setting should still be considered. Our findings contradict the conclusions in [2] and serve as a call for caution when researchers are comparing between two machine learning methods.</p>

    <h3>Multi-Behavioral Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shereen Elsayed, Lars Schmidt-Thieme, Ahmed Rashed</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation models are crucial for next-item prediction tasks in various online platforms, yet many focus on a single behavior, neglecting valuable implicit interactions. While multi-behavioral models address this using graph-based approaches, they often fail to capture sequential patterns simultaneously. Our proposed Multi-Behavioral Sequential Recommendation framework (MBSRec) captures the multi-behavior dependencies between the heterogeneous historical interactions via multi-head self-attention. Furthermore, we utilize a weighted binary cross-entropy loss for precise behavior control. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate MBSRec’s significant outperformance of state-of-the-art approaches. The implementation code is available here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EGRQutc9xtVYbsbXswUcTb9nvT1Tc9cZ?usp=sharing) during the review and will be added to GitHub upon acceptance.</p>

    <h3>The Role of Unknown Interactions in Implicit Matrix Factorization — A Probabilistic View (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bart Goethals, Joey De Pauw</p>
    <p>Matrix factorization is a well-known and effective methodology for top-k list recommendation. It became widely known during the Netflix challenge in 2006, and since then, many adapted and improved versions have been published. A particularly interesting matrix factorization algorithm called iALS (for implicit Alternating Least Squares) adapts the method for implicit feedback, i.e.\ a setting where only a very small amount of positive labels are available along with a majority of unknown labels. Compared to the classical task of rating prediction, learning from implicit feedback is applicable to many more domains, as the data is more abundant and requires less effort to elicit from users. However, the sparsity, imbalance, and implicit nature of the signal also pose unique challenges to retrieving the most relevant items to recommend. We revisit the role of unknown interactions in implicit matrix factorization. Traditionally, all unknowns are interpreted as negative samples and their importance in the training objective is then down-weighted to balance them out with the known, positive interactions. Interestingly, by adapting a probabilistic view of matrix factorization, we can retain the unknown nature of these interactions by modelling them as either positive or negative. With this new formulation that better fits the underlying data, we gain improved performance on the downstream recommendation task without any computational overhead compared to the popular iALS method. This paper outlines the key insights needed to adapt iALS to use logistic regression. Furthermore, the popular full-rank EASE model is identified as a special case of iALS. With this knowledge, EASE was trivially adapted to use logistic regression as well. An extensive experimental evaluation on several real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, a discrepancy between the need for weighting between factorization and regression models is discovered, leading towards a better understanding of these methods.</p>

    <h3>Calibrating the Predictions for Top-N Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Sato</p>
    <p>Well-calibrated predictions of user preferences are essential for many applications. Since recommender systems typically select the top-N items for users, calibration for those top-N items, rather than for all items, is important.  We show that previous calibration methods result in miscalibrated predictions for the top-N items, despite their excellent calibration performance when evaluated on all items.  In this work, we address the miscalibration in the top-N recommended items. We first define evaluation metrics for this objective and then propose a generic method to optimize calibration models focusing on the top-N items. It groups the top-N items by their ranks and optimizes distinct calibration models for each group with rank-dependent training weights.  We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for both explicit and implicit feedback datasets, using diverse classes of recommender models.</p>

    <h3>Multi-Objective Recommendation via Multivariate Policy Learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Potapov, Sourabh Vaid, Wenzhe Shi, Nakul Agarwal, Olivier Jeunen, Jatin Mandav, Aleksei Ustimenko</p>
    <p>Real-world recommender systems often need to balance multiple objectives when deciding which recommendations to present to users. These include behavioural signals (e.g. clicks, shares, dwell time), as well as broader objectives (e.g. diversity, fairness). Scalarisation methods are commonly used to handle this balancing task, where a weighted average of per-objective reward signals determines the final score used for ranking. Naturally, <i>how</i> these weights are computed exactly, is key to success for any online platform. We frame this as a decision-making task, where the scalarisation weights are <i>actions</i> taken to maximise an overall North Star reward (e.g. long-term user retention or growth). We extend existing policy learning methods to the continuous multivariate action domain, proposing to maximise a pessimistic lower bound on the North Star reward that the learnt policy will yield. Typical lower bounds based on normal approximations suffer from insufficient coverage, and we propose an efficient and effective policy-dependent correction for this. We provide guidance to design stochastic data collection policies, as well as highly sensitive reward signals. Empirical observations from simulations, offline and online experiments highlight the efficacy of our deployed approach.</p>

    <h3>Cross-Domain Latent Factors Sharing via Implicit Matrix Factorization (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexey Vasilev, Anton Vakhrushev, Evgeny Frolov, Abdulaziz Samra, Alexander Grigorevskiy</p>
    <p>Data sparsity has been one of the long-standing problems for recommender systems. One of the solutions to mitigate this issue is to exploit knowledge available in other source domains. However, many cross-domain recommender systems introduce a complex architecture that makes them less scalable in practice. On the other hand, matrix factorization methods are still considered to be strong baselines for single-domain recommendations. In this paper, we introduce the CDIMF, a model that extends the standard implicit matrix factorization with ALS to cross-domain scenarios. We apply the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers to learn shared latent factors for overlapped users while factorizing the interaction matrix. In a dual-domain setting, experiments on industrial datasets demonstrate a competing performance of CDIMF for both cold-start and warm-start. The proposed model can outperform most other recent cross-domain and single-domain models.</p>

    <h3>Unified Denoising Training for Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingpeng Du, Ziyan Wang, Haoyan Chua, Zhu Sun, Jie Zhang, Yew-Soon Ong</p>
    <p>Most existing denoising recommendation methods mainly alleviate noisy implicit feedback (user behaviors) through empirical studies. However, such studies may lack theoretical explainability and fail to model comprehensive noise patterns, which hinders understanding and capturing different noise patterns that show distinct effects on users’ behaviors. Thus, we propose to capture comprehensive noise patterns through a holistic theoretical analysis for more effective denoising, whereby users’ behaviors are divided into the willingness (to interact with) and action (to interact with) phases to disentangle the independent noise patterns. Our analysis unveils that (1) in the willingness phase, the high uncertainty of the user’s willingness to interact with the item can lead to high expectation loss, unifying explainability for existing denoising methods; and (2) in the action phase, higher user-specific inconsistency between willingness and action can not only lead to more noise in the user’s overall behaviors but also make it harder to distinguish between her true and noisy behaviors. All these findings are also aligned with our empirical observations. Inspired by these findings, we propose a Unified Denoising Training (UDT) method for recommendation. To alleviate uncertainty in the willingness phase, we lower the importance of the user-item interaction with high willingness uncertainty recognized by high loss. To ease the inconsistency in the action phase, we lower the overall importance for users with high user-specific inconsistency as it may lead to more noisy behaviors, and then increase the importance gap between recognized true and noisy behaviors for users with low user-specific inconsistency as their behaviors are more distinguishable. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our proposed UDT outperforms state-of-the-art denoising recommendation methods.</p>

    <h3>“More to Read” at the Los Angeles Times: Solving a Cold Start Problem with LLMs to Improve Story Discovery (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Kaufman, Franklin Horn, Aurelia Alston, Won You</p>
    <p>News publishers, who are seeking to grow their digital audience, face a challenge in providing relevant content recommendations for unregistered users arriving directly to article pages. In these cold start scenarios, classic techniques, like asking a user to register and select topics of interest, fall short. We present a contextual targeting approach that leverages the user’s current article choice itself as an implicit signal of user interests. We designed and developed an interface with recommendations to help users discover more articles. Our online A/B testing demonstrated that our models increased click-through rates by 39.4% over a popularity baseline. One of them, a large language model (LLM), generates relevant recommendations that balance immersion and novelty. We discuss the implications of using LLMs for responsibly enhancing user experiences while upholding editorial standards. We identify key opportunities in detecting nuanced user preferences and identifying and interrupting filter bubbles on news publisher sites.</p>

    <h3>Unleashing the Retrieval Potential of Large Language Models in Conversational Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ting Yang, Li Chen</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to capture user preferences and provide personalized recommendations through interactive natural language interactions. The recent advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized human engagement in natural conversations, driven by their extensive world knowledge and remarkable natural language understanding and generation capabilities. However, introducing LLMs into CRSs presents new technical challenges. Specifically, directly prompting LLMs for recommendation generation requires understanding a large and evolving item corpus, as well as grounding the generated recommendations in the real item space. Moreover, generating recommendations based on external recommendation engines or directly integrating their suggestions into responses may constrain the overall performance of LLMs, since these engines generally have inferior representation abilities compared to LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end large-scale CRS model, ReFICR, a novel LLM-enhanced conversational recommender that empowers a retrievable large language model to perform CRS subtasks by following retrieval and generation instructions through lightweight tuning. By decomposing the complex CRS task into multiple subtasks, we formulate these subtasks into two types of instruction formats: retrieval and generation. The hidden states of ReFICR are utilized as text embeddings to represent user preferences and items for retrieval. Simultaneously, ReFICR is trained to handle generative tasks. We optimize the contrastive objective to enhance text embeddings for retrieval and jointly fine-tune the large language model objective for generation. Our experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that ReFICR significantly outperforms baselines in terms of recommendation accuracy. Our code is publicly available at the link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReFICR-0C3A.</p>

    <h3>Two-sided Calibration for Quality-aware Responsible Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min Zhang, Chao Deng, Yiqun Liu, Haitao Zeng, Yankai Liu, Yuanqing Yu, Chenyang Wang, Weizhi Ma, Junlan Feng</p>
    <p>Calibration in recommender systems ensures that the user’s interests distribution over groups of items is reflected with their corresponding proportions in the recommendation, which has gained increasing attention recently. For example, a user who watched 80 entertainment videos and 20 knowledge videos is expected to receive recommendations comprising about 80% entertainment and 20% knowledge videos as well.  However, with the increasing calls for quality-aware responsible recommendation, it has become inadequate to just match users’ historical behaviors, which could still lead to undesired effects at the system level (e.g., overwhelming clickbaits). In this paper, we envision the two-sided calibration task that not only matches the users’ past interests distribution (user-level calibration) but also guarantees an overall target exposure distribution of different item groups (system-level calibration).  The target group exposure distribution can be explicitly pursued by users, platform owners, and even the law (e.g., the platform owners expect about 50% knowledge video recommendation on the whole). To support this scenario, we propose a post-processing method named PCT. PCT first solves personalized calibration targets that minimize the changes in users’ historical interest distributions while ensuring the overall target group exposure distribution. Then, PCT reranks the original recommendation lists according to personalized calibration targets to generate both relevant and two-sided calibrated recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to calibrated and fairness-aware recommendation approaches. We also release a new dataset with item quality annotations to support further studies about quality-aware responsible recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Masked and Swapped Sequence Modeling for Next Novel Basket Recommendation in Grocery Shopping (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Yates, Mozhdeh Ariannezhad, Maarten de Rijke, Ming Li</p>
    <p>Next basket recommendation (NBR) is the task of predicting the next set of items based on a sequence of already purchased baskets. It is a recommendation task that has been widely studied, especially in the context of grocery shopping. In NBR, it is useful to distinguish between repeat items, i.e., items that a user has consumed before, and explore items, i.e., items that a user has not consumed before. Most NBR work either ignores this distinction or focuses on repeat items. We formulate the next novel basket recommendation (NNBR) task, i.e., the task of recommending a basket that only consists of novel items, which is valuable for both real-world application and NBR evaluation. We evaluate how existing NBR methods perform on the NNBR task and find that, so far, limited progress has been made w.r.t. the NNBR task. To address the NNBR task, we propose a simple bi-directional transformer basket recommendation model (BTBR), which is focused on directly modeling item-to-item correlations within and across baskets instead of learning complex basket representations. To properly train BTBR, we propose and investigate several masking strategies and training objectives: (i) item-level random masking, (ii) item-level select masking, (iii) basket-level all masking, (iv) item basket-level explore masking, and (v) joint masking. In addition, an item-basket swapping strategy is proposed to enrich the item interactions within the same baskets. We conduct extensive experiments on three open datasets with various characteristics. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of BTBR and our masking and swapping strategies for the NNBR task. BTBR with a properly selected masking and swapping strategy can substantially improve the NNBR performance.</p>

    <h3>Challenges for Anonymous Session-Based Recommender Systems in Indoor Environments (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Ferrato</p>
    <p>Recommender Systems (RSs) have gained widespread popularity for providing personalized recommendations in manifold domains. However, considering the growing user privacy concerns, the development of recommender systems that prioritize data protection has become increasingly important. In indoor environments, RSs face unique challenges, and ongoing research is being conducted to address them. Anonymous Session-Based Recommender Systems (ASBRSs) can represent a possible solution to address these challenges while ensuring user privacy. This paper aims to bridge the gap between existing RS research and the demand for privacy-preserving recommender systems, especially in indoor settings, where significant research efforts are underway. Therefore, it proposes three research questions: How does user modeling based on implicit feedback impact on ASBRSs, considering different embedding extraction networks? How can short sessions be leveraged to start the recommendation process in ASBRSs? To what extent can ASBRSs generate fair recommendations? By investigating these questions, this study establishes the foundations for applying ASBRSs in indoor environments, safeguarding user privacy, and contributing to the ongoing research in this field.</p>

    <h3>Ex2Vec: Characterizing Users and Items from the Mere Exposure Effect (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Sguerra, Romain Hennequin</p>
    <p>The traditional recommendation framework seeks to connect user and content, by finding the best match possible based on users past interaction. However, a good content recommendation is not necessarily similar to what the user has chosen in the past. One limitation of basing future interaction on what happened in the past is that it ignores the fact that both sides of the problems are dynamic. As human, users naturally evolve, learn, forget, get bored, they change their perspective of the world and in consequence, of the recommendable content. In this work we present Ex2Vec our framework for accounting to the dynamic of the human side of the recommendation problem. We introduce the Mere Exposure Effect as a common phenomenon in music streaming platforms. We then present our model that leverage the effect for jointly characterizing users and music. We validate our model through predicting future music consumption based on repetition and discuss its implications.</p>

    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ladislav Peska, Stepan Balcar</p>
    <p>The main source of knowledge utilized in recommender systems (RS) is users’ feedback. While the usage of implicit feedback (i.e. user’s behavior statistics) is gaining in prominence, the explicit feedback (i.e. user’s ratings) remain an important data source. This is true especially for domains, where evaluation of an object does not require an extensive usage and users are well motivated to do so (e.g., video-on-demand services or library archives).<br>So far, numerous rating schemes for explicit feedback have been proposed, ranging both in granularity and presentation style. There are several works studying the effect of rating’s scale and presentation on user’s rating behavior, e.g. willingness to provide feedback or various biases in rating behavior. Nonetheless, the effect of ratings granularity on RS performance remain largely under-researched.<br>In this paper, we studied the combined effect of ratings granularity and supposed probability of feedback existence on various performance statistics of recommender systems. Results indicate that decreasing feedback granularity may lead to changes in RS’s performance w.r.t. nDCG for some recommending algorithms. Nonetheless, in most cases the effect of feedback granularity is surpassed by even a small decrease in feedback’s quantity. Therefore, our results corroborate the policy of many major real-world applications, i.e. preference of simpler rating schemes with the higher chance of feedback reception instead of finer-grained rating scenarios.</p>
