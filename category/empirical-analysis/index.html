    <h3>FairCRS: Towards User-oriented Fairness in Conversational Recommendation Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianlong Gu, Qin Liu, Xuan Feng, Xiaoli Liu</p>
    <p>Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRSs) enable recommender systems to explicitly acquire user preferences during multiturn interactions, providing more accurate and personalized recommendations. However, the data imbalance in CRSs, due to inconsistent interaction history among users, may lead to disparate treatment for disadvantaged user groups. In this paper, we investigate the discriminate issues in CRS from the user’s perspective, called as user-oriented fairness. To reveal the unfairness problems of different user groups in CRS, we conduct extensive empirical analyses. To mitigate user unfairness, we propose a user-oriented fairness framework, named FairCRS, which is a model-agnostic framework. In particular, we develop a user-embedding reconstruction mechanism that enriches user embeddings by incorporating more interaction information, and design a user-oriented fairness strategy that optimizes the recommendation quality differences among user groups while alleviating unfairness. Extensive experimental results on English and Chinese datasets show that FairCRS outperforms state-of-the-art CRSs in terms of overall recommendation performance and user fairness.</p>

    <h3>The effect of third party implementations on reproducibility (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ádám Tibor Czapp, Balázs Hidasi</p>
    <p>Reproducibility of recommender systems research has come under scrutiny during recent years. Along with works focusing on repeating experiments with certain algorithms, the research community has also started discussing various aspects of evaluation and how these affect reproducibility. We add a novel angle to this discussion by examining how unofficial third-party implementations could benefit or hinder reproducibility. Besides giving a general overview, we thoroughly examine six third-party implementations of a popular recommender algorithm and compare them to the official version on five public datasets. In the light of our alarming findings we aim to draw the attention of the research community to this neglected aspect of reproducibility.</p>

    <h3>A Probabilistic Position Bias Model for Short-Video Recommendation Feeds (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Jeunen</p>
    <p>Modern web-based platforms often show ranked lists of recommendations to users, in an attempt to maximise user satisfaction or business metrics. Typically, the goal of such systems boils down to maximising the exposure probability — conversely, minimising the rank— for items that are deemed “reward-maximising” according to some metric of interest. This general framing comprises music or movie streaming applications, as well as e-commerce, restaurant or job recommendations, and even web search. Position bias or user models can be used to estimate exposure probabilities for each use-case, specifically tailored to how users interact with the presented rankings. A unifying factor in these diverse problem settings is that typically only one or several items will be engaged with (clicked, streamed, purchased, et cetera) before a user leaves the ranked list.  Short-video feeds on social media platforms diverge from this general framing in several ways, most notably that users do not tend to leave the feed after, for example, liking a post. Indeed, seemingly infinite feeds invite users to scroll further down the ranked list. For this reason, existing position bias or user models tend to fall short in such settings, as they do not accurately capture users’ interaction modalities. In this work, we propose a novel and probabilistically sound personalised position bias model for feed recommendations. We focus on a 1st-level feed in a hierarchical structure, where users may enter a 2nd-level feed via any given 1st-level item. We posit that users come to the platform with a given scrolling budget that is drawn according to a discrete power-law distribution, and show how the survival function of said distribution can be used to obtain closed-form estimates for personalised exposure probabilities. Empirical insights gained through data from a large-scale social media platform show how our probabilistic position bias model more accurately captures empirical exposure than existing models, and paves the way for improved unbiased evaluation and learning-to-rank.</p>

    <h3>Disentangling Motives behind Item Consumption and Social Connection for Mutually-enhanced Joint Prediction (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yew Soon Ong, Jie Zhang, Zhu Sun, Youchen Sun, Xiao Sha</p>
    <p>Item consumption and social connection, as common user behaviors in many web applications, have been extensively studied. However, most current works separately perform either item or social link prediction tasks, possibly with the help of the other as an auxiliary signal. Moreover, they merely consider the behaviors in a holistic manner yet neglect the multi-faceted motives behind them (e.g., watching movies to kill time or with friends; connecting with others due to friendships or colleagues). To fill the gap, we propose to disentangle the multi-faceted motives in each network, defined respectively by the two types of behaviors, for mutually- enhanced joint prediction (DMJP). Specifically, we first learn the disentangled user representations driven by motives of multi-facets in both networks. Thereafter, the mutual influence of the two networks is subtly discriminated at the facet-to-facet level. The fine-grained mutual influence, proven to be asymmetric, is then exploited to help refine user representations in both networks, with the goal of achieving a mutually-enhanced joint item and social link prediction. Empirical studies on three public datasets showcase the superiority of DMJP against state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on both tasks.</p>

    <h3>Biases in Recommendation System (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saumya Bhadani</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems shape what people consume and experience online, which makes it critical to assess their effect on society and whether they are affected by any potential source of bias. My research focuses on a specific source of bias — popularity — that is especially relevant in two online contexts: news consumption, and cultural markets. Social media newsfeeds, which are designed to optimize the engagement of users, may inadvertently promote inaccurate and partisan news domains, since these are often popular among like-minded and polarized audiences. More generally, in any type of cultural market, popularity bias may lead to the suppression of niche quality products, which may not attract enough attention. In the context of online newsfeeds, I am investigating whether the political diversity of the audience of a news website can be used as signal of journalistic quality. In an analysis of a comprehensive dataset of news source reliability ratings and web browsing histories, I have shown that the diversity of the audience of a news website is a valuable signal to counter popularity bias and to promote journalistic quality. To further validate these results experimentally, I propose to have direct interactions with social media users through surveys. Here, I provide the details of a field study that I am planning to undertake using an experimental social media platform. More generally, in the context of any online cultural market, political audience diversity may not be applicable but the idea of diversity as a signal for higher quality might still be useful. For example, movies which are liked by an “age diverse” population or books which are read by racially diverse audience may have better quality than other items. However, in this research I have explored audience diversity in the context of social media newsfeeds only. For any online cultural market, I propose a method to quantify the popularity bias through an empirical analysis, using data from several existing markets. Accurately estimating the impact of popularity bias can help us advance our understanding of machine biases and also lead to the development of more robust recommendation systems.</p>

    <h3>Transformers4Rec: Bridging the Gap between NLP and Sequential / Session-Based Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ronay Ak, Even Oldridge, Sara Rabhi, Gabriel de Souza Pereira Moreira, Jeong Min Lee</p>
    <p>Much of the recent progress in sequential and session-based recommendation has been driven by improvements in model architecture and pretraining techniques originating in the field of Natural Language Processing. Transformer architectures in particular have facilitated building higher-capacity models and provided data augmentation and training techniques which demonstrably improve the effectiveness of sequential recommendation. But with a thousandfold more research going on in NLP, the application of transformers for recommendation understandably lags behind. To remedy this we introduce Transformers4Rec, an open-source library built upon HuggingFace’s Transformers library with a similar goal of opening up the advances of NLP based Transformers to the recommender system community and making these advancements immediately accessible for the tasks of sequential and session-based recommendation. Like its core dependency, Transformers4Rec is designed to be extensible by researchers, simple for practitioners, and fast and robust in industrial deployments.<br>In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the library and the applicability of Transformer architectures in next-click prediction for user sessions, where sequence lengths are much shorter than those commonly found in NLP, we have leveraged Transformers4Rec to win two recent session-based recommendation competitions. In addition, we present in this paper the first comprehensive empirical analysis comparing many Transformer architectures and training approaches for the task of session-based recommendation. We demonstrate that the best Transformer architectures have superior performance across two e-commerce datasets while performing similarly to the baselines on two news datasets. We further evaluate in isolation the effectiveness of the different training techniques used in causal language modeling, masked language modeling, permutation language modeling and replacement token detection for a single Transformer architecture, XLNet. We establish that training XLNet with replacement token detection performs well across all datasets. Finally, we explore techniques to include side information such as item and user context features in order to establish best practices and show that the inclusion of side information uniformly improves recommendation performance.

    <h3>Recommending Fair Payments for Large-Scale Social Ridesharing (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georgios Chalkiadakis, Alessandro Farinelli, Filippo Bistaffa, Sarvapali D. Ramchurn</p>
    <p>We perform recommendations for the Social Ridesharing scenario, in which a set of commuters, connected through a social network, arrange one-time rides at short notice. In particular, we focus on how much one should pay for taking a ride with friends. More formally, we propose the first approach that can compute fair coalitional payments that are also stable according to the game-theoretic concept of the for systems with thousands of agents in real-world scenarios. Our tests, based on real datasets for both spatial (GeoLife) and social data (Twitter), show that our approach is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art (up to 84 times), allowing us to compute stable payments for 2000 agents in 50 minutes. We also develop a parallel version of our approach, which achieves a near-optimal speed-up in the number of processors used. Finally, our empirical analysis reveals new insights into the relationship between payments incurred by a user by virtue of its position in its social network and its role (rider or driver).</p>

    <h3>Using Graded Implicit Feedback for Bayesian Personalized Ranking (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Lukas Lerche</p>
    <p>In many application domains of recommender systems, explicit rating information is sparse or non-existent. The preferences of the current user have therefore to be approximated by interpreting his or her behavior, i.e., the implicit user feedback. In the literature, a number of algorithm proposals have been made that rely solely on such implicit feedback, among them Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR). In the BPR approach, pairwise comparisons between the items are made in the training phase and an item i is considered to be preferred over item j if the user interacted in some form with i but not with j. In real-world applications, however, implicit feedback is not necessarily limited to such binary decisions as there are, e.g., different types of user actions like item views, cart or purchase actions and there can exist several actions for an item over time. In this paper we show how BPR can be extended to deal with such more fine-granular, graded preference relations. An empirical analysis shows that this extension can help to measurably increase the predictive accuracy of BPR on realistic e-commerce datasets.</p>
