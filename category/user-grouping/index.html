    <h3>Pick &amp; Merge: An Efficient Item Filtering Scheme for Windows Store Recommendations (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nir Nice, Adi Makmal, Liron Allerhand, Jonathan Ephrath, Hilik Berezin, Noam Koenigstein</p>
    <p>Microsoft Windows is the most popular operating system (OS) for personal computers (PCs). With hundreds of millions of users, its app marketplace, Windows Store, is one of the largest in the world. As such, special considerations are required in order to improve online computational efficiency and response times. This paper presents the results of an extensive research of effective filtering method for semi-personalized recommendations. The filtering problem, defined here for the first time, addresses an aspect that was so far largely overlooked by the recommender systems literature, namely effective and efficient method for removing items from semi-personalized recommendation lists. Semi-personalized recommendation lists serve a common list to a group of people based on their shared interest or background. Unlike fully personalized lists, these lists are cacheable and constitute the majority of recommendation lists in many online stores. This motivates the following question: can we remove (most of) the users’ undesired items without collapsing onto fully personalized recommendations?Our solution is based on dividing the users into few subgroups, such that each subgroup receives a different variant of the original recommendation list. This approach adheres to the principles of semi-personalization and hence preserves simplicity and cacheability. We formalize the problem of finding optimal subgroups that minimize the total number of filtering errors, and show that it is combinatorially formidable. Consequently, a greedy algorithm is proposed that filters out most of the undesired items, while bounding the maximal number of errors for each user. Finally, a detailed evaluation of the proposed algorithm is presented using both proprietary and public datasets. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Using Taste Groups for Collaborative Filtering (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nevin L. Zhang, Farhan Khawar</p>
    <p>Implicit feedback is the simplest form of user feedback that can be used for item recommendation. It is easy to collect and domain independent. However, there is a lack of negative examples. Existing works circumvent this problem by making various assumptions regarding the unconsumed items, which fail to hold when the user did not consume an item because she was unaware of it. In this paper, we propose as a novel method for addressing the lack of negative examples in implicit feedback. The motivation is that if there is a large group of users who share the same taste and none of them consumed an item, then it is highly likely that the item is irrelevant to this taste. We use Hierarchical Latent Tree Analysis(HLTA) to identify taste-based user groups and make recommendations for a user based on her memberships in the groups.</p>

    <h3>Generation Meets Recommendation: Proposing Novel Items for Groups of Users (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harold Soh, Thanh Vinh Vo</p>
    <p>Consider a movie studio aiming to produce a set of new movies for summer release: What types of movies it should produce? Who would the movies appeal to? How many movies should it make? Similar issues are encountered by a variety of organizations, e.g., mobile-phone manufacturers and online magazines, who have to create new (non-existent) items to satisfy groups of users with different preferences. In this paper, we present a joint problem formalization of these interrelated issues, and propose novel generative methods that address these questions simultaneously. Specifically, we leverage on the latent space obtained by training a deep generative model—the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)—via a loss function that incorporates both rating performance and item reconstruction terms. We use a greedy search algorithm that utilize this learned latent space to jointly obtain K plausible new items, and user groups that would find the items appealing. An evaluation of our methods on a synthetic dataset indicates that our approach is able to generate novel items similar to highly-desirable unobserved items. As a case study on real-world data, we applied our method to the MART abstract art and Movielens Tag Genome dataset, which resulted in a promising results: small but diverse sets of proposed items.</p>

    <h3>CoBaR: Confidence-Based Recommender (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Fortes Da Costa, Fernando Soares de Aguiar Neto, Marcelo Manzato</p>
    <p>Neighborhood-based collaborative filtering algorithms usually adopt a fixed neighborhood size for every user or item, although groups of users or items may have different lengths depending on users’ preferences. In this paper, we propose an extension to a non-personalized recommender based on confidence intervals and hierarchical clustering to generate groups of users with optimal sizes. The evaluation shows that the proposed technique outperformed the traditional recommender algorithms in four publicly available datasets.</p>
