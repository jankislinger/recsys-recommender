    <h3>Explainable Multi-Stakeholder Job Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roan Schellingerhout</p>
    <p>Public opinion on recommender systems has become increasingly wary in recent years. In line with this trend, lawmakers have also started to become more critical of such systems, resulting in the introduction of new laws focusing on aspects such as privacy, fairness, and explainability for recommender systems and AI at large. These concepts are especially crucial in high-risk domains such as recruitment. In recruitment specifically, decisions carry substantial weight, as the outcomes can significantly impact individuals’ careers and companies’ success. Additionally, there is a need for a multi-stakeholder approach, as these systems are used by job seekers, recruiters, and companies simultaneously, each with its own requirements and expectations. In this paper, I summarize my current research on the topic of explainable, multi-stakeholder job recommender systems and set out a number of future research directions.</p>

    <h3>Fairness and Transparency in Music Recommender Systems: Improvements for Artists (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karlijn Dinnissen</p>
    <p>Music streaming services have become one of the main sources of music consumption in the last decade, with recommender systems as an important component. As those systems partially decide the songs that music consumers listen to, the systems greatly impact the artists who created the songs. However, when evaluating performance and fairness of these music recommending systems (MRSs), the perspective of the item providers or other music industry professionals is often not considered. Additionally, artists indicate they would appreciate more transparency – both towards and users and the artists themselves – regarding why certain items are recommended and others are not. This research project takes a multi-stakeholder approach to bridge the gap between music systems and their item providers. We first establish artists’ and music industry professionals’ perspective on MRSs through interviews and questionnaires. Based on those insights, we then aim to increase matching between end users and lesser-known artists by generating rich item and user representations. Results will be evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. Lastly, we plan to effectively communicate MRS fairness by increasing transparency for both end users and artists.</p>

    <h3>A Multi-Stakeholder Recommender System for Rewards Recommendations (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Leontjeva, Thireindar Min, Luiz Pizzato, Naime Ranjbar Kermany, Callum Scott</p>
    <p>Australia’s largest bank, Commonwealth Bank (CBA) has a large data and analytics function that focuses on building a brighter future for all using data and decision science. In this work, we focus on creating better services for CBA customers by developing a next generation recommender system that brings the most relevant merchant reward offers that can help customers save money. Our recommender provides CBA cardholders with cashback offers from merchants, who have different objectives when they create offers. This work describes a multi-stakeholder, multi-objective problem in the context of CommBank Rewards (CBR) and describes how we developed a system that balances the objectives of the bank, its customers, and the many objectives from merchants into a single recommender system.</p>
