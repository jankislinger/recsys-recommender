    <h3>Siamese Neural Networks for Content-based Cold-Start Music Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Pulis, Josef Bajada</p>
    <p>Music recommendation systems typically use collaborative filtering to determine which songs to recommend to their users. This mechanism matches a user with listeners that have similar tastes, and uses their listening history to find songs that the user will probably like. The fundamental issue with this approach is that artists already need to have a significant user following to get a fair chance of being recommended. This is known as the music cold-start problem. In this work, we investigate the possibility of making music recommendations based on audio content so that new artists still get a good chance of being recommended, even if they do not have a sufficient number of listeners yet. We propose the use of Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) to determine the similarity between two audio clips. Each clip is first pre-processed into a Mel-Spectrogram, which is then used as input to an SNN consisting of two identical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The output of each CNN is then compared together to determine whether two songs are similar or not. These were trained using audio from the Free Music Archive, with the genre used as a heuristic to determine the similarity between song pairs. A query-by-multiple-example (QBME) music recommendation system was developed that makes use of the proposed content-based similarity metric to find songs that match the user’s tastes. This was packaged inside an online blind-test survey, which first prompts participants to select a set of preferred songs, and then recommends a number of songs which the subject is expected to listen to and rate on a Likert scale. The recommendations from the proposed algorithm were stochastically interleaved with songs selected randomly from the preferred genres of the user, as a baseline for comparison. The participants were not aware that the recommendations came from two different algorithms. Our findings show that 60.7% of the 150 participants gave higher ratings to the recommendations made by the proposed SNN-based algorithm. Findings also show that 55% of the recommended songs had less than 1,500 listens, demonstrating that the proposed content-based approach can provide a fairer exposure to all artists based on their music, independent of their fame and popularity.</p>

    <h3>Shared Neural Item Representations for Completely Cold Start Problem (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guannan Liang, Young-joo Chung, Ramin Raziperchikolaei</p>
    <p>Neural networks have become popular recently in recommendation systems to extract user and item representations. Most previous works follow a two-branch setting, where user and item networks learn user and item representations in the first and second branches, respectively. In the item cold-start problem, where the usage patterns of the items do not exist, the user network uses ID/interaction vector as the input and the item network uses the item side information (content) as the input. In this paper, we will show that by using this structure, two representations are learned for each item in the training set; one is the output of the item network and the other one is hidden inside the user network and is used for learning user representations. Learning two representations makes training slower and optimization more difficult. We propose to unify the two representations and only use the one generated by the item network. Also, we will show how attention mechanisms fit in our setting and how they can improve the quality of the representations. Our results on public and real-world datasets show that our approach converges faster, achieves higher recall in fewer iterations, and is more robust to the changes in the number of training samples compared to the previous works.</p>

    <h3>ExcUseMe: Asking Users to Help in Item Cold-Start Recommendations (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oren Somekh, Oren Anava, Michal Aharon, Dana Drachsler-Cohen, Noa Avigdor-Elgrabli, Shahar Golan</p>
    <p>The item cold-start problem is of a great importance in collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation systems. It arises when new items are added to the inventory and the system cannot model them properly since it relies solely on historical users’ interactions (e.g., ratings). Much work has been devoted to mitigate this problem mostly by employing hybrid approaches that combine content-based recommendation techniques or by devoting a portion of the user traffic for exploration to gather interactions from random users. We focus on pure CF recommender systems (i.e., without content or context information) in a realistic online setting, where random exploration is inefficient and smart exploration that carefully selects users is crucial due to the huge flux of new items with short lifespan. We further assume that users arrive randomly one after the other and that the system has to immediately decide whether the arriving user will participate in the exploration of the new items. For this setting we present , a smart exploration algorithm that selects a predefined number of users for exploring new items. gradually excavates the users that are more likely to be interested in the new items and models the new items based on the users’ interactions. We evaluated on several datasets and scenarios and compared it to state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results indicate that is an efficient algorithm that outperforms all other algorithms in all tested scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Item Cold-Start Recommendations: Learning Local Collective Embeddings (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Saveski, Amin Mantrach</p>
    <p>Recommender systems suggest to users items that they might like (e.g., news articles, songs, movies) and, in doing so, they help users deal with information overload and enjoy a personalized experience. One of the main problems of these systems is the item cold-start, i.e., when a new item is introduced in the system and no past information is available, then no effective recommendations can be produced. The item cold-start is a very common problem in practice: modern online platforms have hundreds of new items published every day. To address this problem, we propose to learn Local Collective Embeddings — a matrix factorization that exploits items’ properties and past user preferences while enforcing the manifold structure exhibited by the collective embeddings. We present a learning algorithm based on multiplicative update rules that are efficient and easy to implement. Experiments on two item cold-start use cases: news recommendation and email recipient recommendation, demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and show that it significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art methods for item cold-start.</p>
