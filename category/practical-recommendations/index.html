    <h3>Navigating the Feedback Loop in Recommender Systems: Insights and Strategies from Industry Practice (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ding Tong, Justin Basilico, James McInerney, Ting-Po Lee, Qifeng Qiao</p>
    <p>Understanding and measuring the impact of feedback loops in industrial recommender systems is challenging, leading to the underestimation of the deterioration. In this study, we define open and closed feedback loops and investigate the unique reasons behind the emergence of feedback loops in the industry, drawing from real-world examples that have received limited attention in prior research. We highlight the measurement challenges associated with capturing the full impact of feedback loops using traditional online A/B tests. To address this, we propose the use of offline evaluation frameworks as surrogates for long-term feedback loop bias, supported by a practical simulation system using real data. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the performance of recommender systems operating under feedback loop conditions.</p>

    <h3>Neural Collaborative Filtering vs. Matrix Factorization Revisited (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John Anderson, Steffen Rendle, Walid Krichene, Li Zhang</p>
    <p>Embedding based models have been the state of the art in collaborative filtering for over a decade. Traditionally, the dot product or higher order equivalents have been used to combine two or more embeddings, e.g., most notably in matrix factorization. In recent years, it was suggested to replace the dot product with a learned similarity e.g. using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). This approach is often referred to as neural collaborative filtering (NCF). In this work, we revisit the experiments of the NCF paper that popularized learned similarities using MLPs. First, we show that with a proper hyperparameter selection, a simple dot product substantially outperforms the proposed learned similarities. Second, while a MLP can in theory approximate any function, we show that it is non-trivial to learn a dot product with an MLP. Finally, we discuss practical issues that arise when applying MLP based similarities and show that MLPs are too costly to use for item recommendation in production environments while dot products allow to apply very efficient retrieval algorithms. We conclude that MLPs should be used with care as embedding combiner and that dot products might be a better default choice.</p>
