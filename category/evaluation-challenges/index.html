    <h3>Widespread flaws in offline evaluation of recommender systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ádám Tibor Czapp, Balázs Hidasi</p>
    <p>Even though offline evaluation is just an imperfect proxy of online performance — due to the interactive nature of recommenders — it will probably remain the primary way of evaluation in recommender systems research for the foreseeable future, since the proprietary nature of production recommenders prevents independent validation of A/B test setups and verification of online results. Therefore, it is imperative that offline evaluation setups are as realistic and as flawless as they can be. Unfortunately, evaluation flaws are quite common in recommenders systems research nowadays, due to later works copying flawed evaluation setups from their predecessors without questioning their validity. In the hope of improving the quality of offline evaluation of recommender systems, we discuss four of these widespread flaws and why researchers should avoid them.</p>

    <h3>Greedy Optimized Multileaving for Personalization (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kojiro Iizuka, Yoshifumi Seki, Takeshi Yoneda</p>
    <p>Personalization plays an important role in many services. To evaluate personalized rankings, online evaluation, such as A/B testing, is widely used today. Recently, multileaving has been found to be an efficient method for evaluating rankings in information retrieval fields. This paper describes the first attempt to optimize the multileaving method for personalization settings. We clarify the challenges of applying this method to personalized rankings. Then, to solve these challenges, we propose greedy optimized multileaving (GOM) with a new credit feedback function. The empirical results showed that GOM was stable for increasing ranking lengths and the number of rankers. We implemented GOM on our actual news recommender systems, and compared its online performance. The results showed that GOM evaluated the personalized rankings precisely, with significantly smaller sample sizes (< 1/10) than A/B testing. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>
