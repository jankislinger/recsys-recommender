    <h3>Towards Green Recommender Systems: Investigating the Impact of Data Reduction on Carbon Footprint and Algorithm Performances (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michela Milano, Cataldo Musto, Allegra De Filippo, Giuseppe Spillo, Giovanni Semeraro</p>
    <p>This work investigates the path toward green recommender systems by examining the impact of data reduction on both model performance and carbon footprint. In the pursuit of developing energy-efficient recommender systems, we investigated whether and how reducting training data impacts the performances of several representative recommendation models. In order to obtain a fair comparison, all the models were run based on the implementations available in a popular recommendation library, i.e., RecBole, and used the same experimental settings. Results indicate that: (a) data reduction can be a promising strategy to make recommender systems more sustainable at the cost of a lower accuracy; (b) training recommender systems with less data makes the suggestions more diverse and less biased. Overall, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the development of recommendation models that meet the principles of SDGs, laying the groundwork for the adoption of more sustainable practices in the field.</p>

    <h3>From Clicks to Carbon: The Environmental Toll of Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Said, Tobias Vente, Lukas Wegmeth, Joeran Beel</p>
    <p>As global warming soars, evaluating the environmental impact of research is more critical now than ever before. However, we find that few to no recommender systems research papers document their impact on the environment. Consequently, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the environmental impact of recommender system research papers by reproducing a characteristic recommender systems experimental pipeline. We focus on estimating the carbon footprint of recommender systems research papers, highlighting the evolution of the environmental impact of recommender systems research experiments over time. We evaluated all 79 full papers from the ACM RecSys 2013 and 2023 conferences to analyze representative experimental pipelines for papers utilizing traditional, so-called good old-fashioned AI algorithms and deep learning algorithms, respectively. We reproduced these representative experimental pipelines, measured electricity consumption using a hardware energy meter, and converted the measured energy consumption into CO2 equivalents to estimate the environmental impact. Our results show that a recommender systems research paper utilizing deep learning algorithms emits approximately 42 times more CO2 equivalents than a paper utilizing traditional algorithms. Furthermore, such a paper produces, on average, 3,297 kilograms of CO2 equivalents, which is more than one person produces by flying from New York City to Melbourne or the amount one tree sequesters in 300 years.</p>

    <h3>Towards Sustainability-aware Recommender Systems: Analyzing the Trade-off Between Algorithms Performance and Carbon Footprint (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Semeraro, Giuseppe Spillo, Allegra De Filippo, Cataldo Musto, Michela Milano</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of the trade-off between the performance of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and their sustainability. In particular, we compared 18 popular recommendation algorithms in terms of both standard metrics (i.e., accuracy and diversity of the recommendations) as well as in terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint on three different datasets. In order to obtain a fair comparison, all the algorithms were run based on the implementations available in a popular recommendation library, i.e., RecBole, and used the same experimental settings. The outcomes of the experiments clearly showed that the choice of the optimal recommendation algorithm requires a thorough analysis, since more sophisticated algorithms often led to tiny improvements at the cost of an exponential increase of carbon emissions. Through this paper, we aim to shed light on the problem of carbon footprint and energy consumption of recommender systems, and we make the first step towards the development of sustainability-aware recommendation algorithms.</p>
