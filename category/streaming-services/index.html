    <h3>Enhancing Recommendation Quality of the SASRec Model by Mitigating Popularity Bias (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xenija Neufeld, Sebastian Loth, Andreas Grün, Venkata Harshit Koneru</p>
    <p>ZDF is a Public Service Media (PSM) broadcaster in Germany that uses recommender systems on its streaming service platform ZDFmediathek. One of the main use cases within the ZDFmediathek is Next Video, which is currently based on a Self-Attention based Sequential Recommendation model (SASRec). For this use case, we modified the loss function, the sampling method of negative items, and introduced the top-k negative sampling strategy and compared this to the vanilla SASRec model. We show that this not only reduces popularity bias, but also increases clicks and the viewing volume compared to that of the vanilla version.</p>

    <h3>On the Consistency of Average Embeddings for Item Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Romain Hennequin, Thomas Bouabça, Guillaume Salha-Galvan, Walid Bendada, Tristan Cazenave</p>
    <p>A prevalent practice in recommender systems consists of averaging item embeddings to represent users or higher-level concepts in the same embedding space. This paper investigates the relevance of such a practice. For this purpose, we propose an expected precision score, designed to measure the consistency of an average embedding relative to the items used for its construction. We subsequently analyze the mathematical expression of this score in a theoretical setting with specific assumptions, as well as its empirical behavior on real-world data from music streaming services. Our results emphasize that real-world averages are less consistent for recommendation, which paves the way for future research to better align real-world embeddings with assumptions from our theoretical setting.</p>

    <h3>Flow Moods: Recommending Music by Moods on Deezer (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marin Lorant, Benjamin Chapus, Mathieu Morlon, Guillaume Salha-Galvan, Théo Bontempelli, François Rigaud</p>
    <p>The music streaming service Deezer extensively relies on its Flow algorithm, which generates personalized radio-style playlists of songs, to help users discover musical content. Nonetheless, despite promising results over the past years, Flow used to ignore the moods of users when providing recommendations. In this paper, we present Flow Moods, an improved version of Flow that addresses this limitation. Flow Moods leverages collaborative filtering, audio content analysis, and mood annotations from professional music curators to generate personalized mood-specific playlists at scale. We detail the motivations, the development, and the deployment of this system on Deezer. Since its release in 2021, Flow Moods has been recommending music by moods to millions of users every day.</p>

    <h3>A User-Centered Investigation of Personal Music Tours (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Gabbolini, Derek Bridge</p>
    <p>Streaming services use recommender systems to surface the right music to users. Playlists are a popular way to present music in a list-like fashion, i.e. as a plain list of songs. An alternative are tours, where the songs alternate with segues, which explain the connections between consecutive songs. Tours address the user need of seeking background information about songs, and are found to be superior to playlists, given the right user context. In this work, we provide, for the first time, a user-centered evaluation of two tour-generation algorithms (Greedy and Optimal) using semi-structured interviews. We assess the algorithms, we discuss attributes of the tours that the algorithms produce, we identify which attributes are desirable and which are not, and we enumerate several possible improvements to the algorithms, along with practical suggestions on how to implement the improvements. Our main findings are that Greedy generates more likeable tours than Optimal, and that three important attributes of tours are segue diversity, song arrangement and song familiarity. More generally, we provide insights into how to present music to users, which could inform the design of user-centered recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>A Human Perspective on Algorithmic Similarity (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary Schendel</p>
    <p>In the Netflix user interface (UI), when a row or UI element is named “Because you Watched...”, “More Like This”, or “Because you added to your list”, the overarching goal is to recommend a movie or TV show that a member might like based on the fact that they took a meaningful action on a source item. We have employed similar recommendations in many UI elements: on the homepage as a row of recommendations, after you click into a title, or as a piece of information about why a member should watch a title. <br>From an algorithmic perspective, there are many ways to define a “successful” similar recommendation. We sought to broaden the definition of success. To this end, the Consumer Insights team recently completed a suite of research projects to explore the intricacies of member perceptions of similar recommendations. The Netflix Consumer Insights team employs qualitative (e.g., in-depth interviews) and quantitative (e.g., surveys) research methods, interfacing directly with Netflix members to uncover pain points that can inspire new product innovation. The research concluded that, while the typical member believes movies are broadly similar when they share a common genre or theme, similarity is more complex, nuanced, and personal than we might have imagined. The vernacular we use in the UI implies that there should be at least some kind of relationship between the source item and the recommendations that follow. Many of our similar recommendations felt “out of place”, mostly because the relationship between the source item and the recommendation was unclear or absent. When similar recommendations tell a completely misleading, incorrect, or confusing story, member trust can be broken.<br>We will structure the presentation around three new insights that our research found to have an influence on the perception of similarity in the context of Netflix as well as the research methods used to uncover those insights. First, the reason a member loves a given movie will vary. For example, do you want to watch other baseball movies like Field of Dreams, or would you prefer other romances like Field of Dreams? Second, members are more or less flexible about how similar a recommendation actually needs to be depending on the properties of and their interactions with the canvas containing the recommendation. For example, a Because You Watched row on the homepage implies vaguer similarity while a More Like This gallery behind a click into the source item implies stricter similarity. Finally, even when we held the UI element constant, we found that similar recommendations are only valuable in some contexts. After finishing a movie, a member might prefer a similar recommendation one day and a change of pace the next. Research methods discussed will include single-arrangement Inverse Multi-Dimensional Scaling [1], survey experimentation, and ways to apply qualitative research to improve algorithmic recommendations.</p>
