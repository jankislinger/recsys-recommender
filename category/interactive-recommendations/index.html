    <h3>Incentivizing Exploration in Linear Contextual Bandits under Information Gap (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Liu, Hongning Wang, Huazheng Wang, Chuanhao Li, Haifeng Xu</p>
    <p>Contextual bandit algorithms have been popularly used to address interactive recommendation, where the users are assumed to be cooperative to explore all recommendations from a system. In this paper, we relax this strong assumption and study the problem of incentivized exploration with myopic users, where the users are only interested in recommendations with their currently highest estimated reward. As a result, in order to obtain long-term optimality, the system needs to offer compensation to incentivize the users to take the exploratory recommendations. We consider a new and practically motivated setting where the context features employed by the user are more <i>informative</i> than those used by the system: for example, features based on users’ private information are not accessible by the system. We develop an effective solution for incentivized exploration under such an information gap, and prove that the method achieves a sublinear rate in both regret and compensation. We theoretically and empirically analyze the added compensation due to the information gap, compared with the case where the system has access to the same context features as the user does, i.e., without information gap. Moreover, we also provide a compensation lower bound of this problem.</p>

    <h3>IRF: Interactive Recommendation through Dialogue (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oznur Alkan, Massimiliano Mattetti, Elizabeth M. Daly, Inge Vejsbjerg, Adi Botea</p>
    <p>Recent research focuses beyond recommendation accuracy, towards human factors that influence the acceptance of recommendations, such as user satisfaction, trust, transparency and sense of control. We present a generic interactive recommender framework that can add interaction functionalities to non-interactive recommender systems. We take advantage of dialogue systems to interact with the user and we design a middleware layer to provide the interaction functions, such as providing explanations for the recommendations, managing users' preferences learnt from dialogue, preference elicitation and refining recommendations based on learnt preferences.</p>

    <h3>Merging Latent Factors and Tags to Increase Interactive Control of Recommendations (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jürgen Ziegler, Tim Donkers, Benedikt Loepp</p>
    <p>We describe a novel approach that integrates user-generated tags with standard Matrix Factorization to allow users to interactively control recommendations. The tag information is incorporated during the learning phase and relates to the automatically derived latent factors. Thus, the system can change an item’s score whenever the user adjusts a tag’s weight. We implemented a prototype and performed a user study showing that this seems to be a promising way for users to interactively manipulate the set of items recommended based on their user profile or in cold-start situations.</p>

    <h3>Interactive Food Recommendation for Groups (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehdi Elahi, Mouzhi Ge, Massimo David, Shlomo Berkovsky, Francesco Ricci</p>
    <p>We present a prototype of a novel interactive food recommender for groups of users that supports groups in planning their meals through a conversational process based on critiquing. The system comprises two novel elements: a user interface and interaction design based on tagging and critiquing, and a utility function incorporating healthiness and diet compliance factors.</p>
