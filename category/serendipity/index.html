    <h3>How to Evaluate Serendipity in Recommender Systems: the Need for a Serendiptionnaire (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brett Binst</p>
    <p>Recommender systems can assist in various user tasks and serve diverse values, including exploring the item space. Serendipity has recently received considerable attention, often seen as a way to broaden users’ tastes and counteract filter bubbles. However, the field of research on serendipity is fragmented regarding its evaluation methods, which impedes the progress of knowledge accumulation. This research plan proposes two studies to address these issues. First, a systematic literature review will be conducted to provide insights into how serendipity is currently studied in the field. This review will serve as a reference for novice researchers and help mitigate fragmentation by presenting a thorough overview of the field. This systematic literature review has already revealed a significant gap: the lack of a validated, widely accepted method for evaluating serendipity. Therefore, the second part of this research plan is to develop a validated questionnaire, the serendiptionnaire, to measure serendipity. This tool will provide a ground truth for evaluating serendipity, aiding in answering fundamental questions within the field and validating offline metrics.</p>

    <h3>Enhancing Cross-Domain Recommender Systems with LLMs: Evaluating Bias and Beyond-Accuracy Measures (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Elmar Kolb</p>
    <p>The research domain of recommender systems is rapidly evolving. Initially, optimization efforts focused primarily on accuracy. However, recent research has highlighted the importance of addressing bias and beyond-accuracy measures such as novelty, diversity, and serendipity. With the rise of multi-domain recommender systems, the need to re-examine bias and beyond-accuracy measures in cross-domain settings has become crucial. Traditional methods face challenges such as cold-start problems, which can potentially be mitigated by leveraging LLMs. This proposed work investigates how LLM-based recommendation methods can enhance cross-domain recommender systems, focusing on identifying, measuring, and mitigating bias while evaluating the impact of beyond-accuracy measures. We aim to provide new insights by comparing traditional and LLM-based systems within a real-world environment encompassing the domains of news, books, and various lifestyle areas. Our research seeks to address the outlined gaps and develop effective evaluation strategies for the unique challenges posed by LLMs in cross-domain recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Values of Exploration in Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohit Sharma, Ya Le, Yuyan Wang, Minmin Chen, Ed Chi, Can Xu, Lee Richardson</p>
    <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been sought after to bring next-generation recommender systems to further improve user experience on recommendation platforms. While the exploration-exploitation tradeoff is the foundation of RL research, the value of exploration in (RL-based) recommender systems is less well understood. Exploration, commonly seen as a tool to reduce model uncertainty in regions of sparse user interaction/feedback, is believed to cost user experience in the short term, while the indirect benefit of better model quality arrives at a later time. We focus on another aspect of exploration, which we refer to as user exploration to help discover new user interests, and argue it can improve user experience even in the more imminent term.<br>We examine the role of user exploration in changing different facets of recommendation quality that more directly impact user experience. To do so, we introduce a series of methods inspired by exploration research in RL to increase user exploration in an RL-based recommender system, and study their effect on the end recommendation quality, more specifically, on accuracy, diversity, novelty and serendipity. We propose a set of metrics to measure (RL based) recommender systems in these four aspects and evaluate the impact of exploration-induced methods against these metrics. In addition to the offline measurements, we conduct live experiments on an industrial recommendation platform serving billions of users to showcase the benefit of user exploration. Moreover, we use conversion of casual users to core users as an indicator of the holistic long-term user experience and study the values of user exploration in helping platforms convert users. Through offline analyses and live experiments, we study the correlation between these four facets of recommendation quality and long term user experience, and connect serendipity to improved long term user experience.</p>

    <h3>Long-tail Session-based Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyi Liu, Yujia Zheng</p>
    <p>Session-based recommendation focuses on the prediction of user actions based on anonymous sessions and is a necessary method in the lack of user historical data. However, none of the existing session-based recommendation methods explicitly takes the long-tail recommendation into consideration, which plays an important role in improving the diversity of recommendation and producing the serendipity. As the distribution of items with long-tail is prevalent in session-based recommendation scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, music, and TV program recommendations), more attention should be put on the long-tail session-based recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture, namely TailNet, to improve long-tail recommendation performance, while maintaining competitive accuracy performance compared with other methods. We start by classifying items into short-head (popular) and long-tail (niche) items based on click frequency. Then a novel preference mechanism is proposed and applied in TailNet to determine user preference between two types of items, so as to softly adjust and personalize recommendations. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art works.</p>

    <h3>Do Channels Matter?: Illuminating Interpersonal Influence on Music Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minju Park, So Yeon Park, Kyogu Lee, Hyun Jeong Kim</p>
    <p>Researchers and service providers have focused on leveraging social information acquired from interactions between users to improve the accuracy of system recommendations. However, few have explained the characteristics of music recommendations through interpersonal relationships. To investigate how interpersonal relationships affect users’ evaluation of music recommendation, we conducted a survey-based study that compared two types of recommendation channels—interpersonal (i.e., from friends) and non-interpersonal (i.e., from systems). We found that relevance was evaluated higher in music recommended from non-interpersonal channels on average, while diversity, novelty, and serendipity were higher in interpersonal channels. Non-interpersonal channels surpassed interpersonal channels in terms of convenience, frequency, and adoption rate. These results illustrate that interpersonal and non-interpersonal channels have different strengths and that digital streaming platforms, which have mainly provided system recommendations thus far, need to better support interpersonal channels for richer user experience.</p>

    <h3>Explanation Chains: Recommendations by Explanation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Derek Bridge, Arpit Rana</p>
    <p>Given a set of candidate items, Recommendation by Explanation constructs a justification for recommending each item, in the form of what we call an Explanation Chain, and then recommends those candidates that have the best explanations. By unifying recommendation and explanation, this approach enables us to find relevant recommendations with explanations that have a high degree of both fidelity and interpretability. Experimental results on a movie recommendation dataset show that our approach also provides sets of recommendations that have a high degree of serendipity, low popularity-bias and high diversity.</p>

    <h3>Predicting Online Performance of News Recommender Systems Through Richer Evaluation Metrics (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boi Faltings, Florent Garcin, Andrii Maksai</p>
    <p>We investigate how metrics that can be measured offine can be used to predict the online performance of recommender systems, thus avoiding costly A-B testing. In addition to accuracy metrics, we combine diversity, coverage, and serendipity metrics to create a new performance model. Using the model, we quantify the trade-off between different metrics and propose to use it to tune the parameters of recommender algorithms without the need for online testing. Another application for the model is a self-adjusting algorithm blend that optimizes a recommender’s parameters over time. We evaluate our findings on data and experiments from news websites.</p>

    <h3>A Recommendation-Based Book-Exchange System Without Using Wish Lists (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiu-Kai Ng, Maria Soledad Pera</p>
    <p>We introduce EasyEx, a recommendation-based book exchange system which identifies potential exchanges for a user solely based on the user’s item list. EasyEx is novel, since it effectively identifies books that are likely appealing to users, and optimizes book-exchange cycles to increase serendipity, instead of simply swapping books on users’ wish lists as performed by existing item-exchange algorithms. Experimental results have verified that EasyEx others users recommended books that satisfy their interests and contributes to the item-exchange mechanism with a new design methodology.</p>
