    <h3>Improving Adversarial Robustness for Recommendation Model via Cross-Domain Distributional Adversarial Training (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Yang, Lilin Zhang, Jingyu Chen</p>
    <p>Recommendation models based on deep learning are fragile when facing adversarial examples (AE). Adversarial training (AT) is the existing mainstream method to promote the adversarial robustness of recommendation models. However, these AT methods often have two drawbacks. First, they may be ineffective due to the ubiquitous sparsity of interaction data. Second, point-wise perturbation used by these AT methods leads to suboptimal adversarial robustness, because not all examples are equally susceptible to such perturbations. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel method called Cross-domain Distributional Adversarial Training (CDAT) which utilizes a richer auxiliary domain to improve the adversarial robustness of a sparse target domain. CDAT comprises a Domain adversarial network (Dan) and a Cross-domain adversarial example generative network (Cdan). Dan learns a domain-invariant preference distribution which is obtained by aligning user embeddings from two domains and paves the way to leverage the knowledge from another domain for the target domain. Then, by adversarially perturbing the domain-invariant preference distribution under the guidance of a discriminator, Cdan captures an aggressive and imperceptible AE distribution. In this way, CDAT can transfer distributional adversarial robustness from the auxiliary domain to the target domain. The extensive experiments conducted on real datasets demonstrate the remarkable superiority of the proposed CDAT in improving the adversarial robustness of the sparse domain.</p>

    <h3>Item2vec: Neural Item Embedding for Collaborative Filtering (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oren Barkan, Noam Koenigstein</p>
    <p>Many Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms are item-based in the sense that they analyze item-item relations in order to produce item similarities. Recently, several works in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggested to learn a latent representation of words using neural embedding algorithms. Among them, the Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS), also known as Word2vec, was shown to provide state-of-the-art results on various linguistics tasks. In this paper, we show that item-based CF can be cast in the same framework of neural word embedding. Inspired by SGNS, we describe a method we name Item2vec for item-based CF that produces embedding for items in a latent space. The method is capable of inferring item-item relations even when user information is not available. We present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the Item2vec method and show it is competitive with SVD.</p>
