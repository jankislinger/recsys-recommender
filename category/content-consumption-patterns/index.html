    <h3>Understanding and Modeling Passive-Negative Feedback for Short-video Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Gao, Yong Li, Depeng Jin, Yunzhu Pan, Kun Gai, Yang Song</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation is one of the most important tasks in recommender systems, which aims to recommend the next interacted item with historical behaviors as input. Traditional sequential recommendation always mainly considers the collected positive feedback such as click, purchase, etc. However, in short-video platforms such as TikTok, video viewing behavior may not always represent positive feedback. Specifically, the videos are played automatically, and users passively receive the recommended videos. In this new scenario, users passively express negative feedback by skipping over videos they do not like, which provides valuable information about their preferences. Different from the negative feedback studied in traditional recommender systems, this passive-negative feedback can reflect users’ interests and serve as an important supervision signal in extracting users’ preferences. Therefore, it is essential to carefully design and utilize it in this novel recommendation scenario. In this work, we first conduct analyses based on a large-scale real-world short-video behavior dataset and illustrate the significance of leveraging passive feedback. We then propose a novel method that deploys the sub-interest encoder, which incorporates positive feedback and passive-negative feedback as supervision signals to learn the user’s current active sub-interest. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive fusion layer to integrate various sub-interests effectively. To enhance the robustness of our model, we then introduce a multi-task learning module to simultaneously optimize two kinds of feedback – passive-negative feedback and traditional randomly-sampled negative feedback. The experiments on two large-scale datasets verify that the proposed method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches. The codes and collected datasets are anonymously released at https:// anonymous.4open.science/ r/ SINE-2047/ to benefit the community.</p>

    <h3>Follow the guides: disentangling human and algorithmic curation in online music consumption (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel Moussallam, Camille Roth, Thomas Louail, Quentin Villermet, Jérémie Poiroux</p>
    <p>The role of recommendation systems in the diversity of content consumption on platforms is a much-debated issue. The quantitative state of the art often overlooks the existence of individual attitudes toward guidance, and eventually of different categories of users in this regard. Focusing on the case of music streaming, we analyze the complete listening history of about 9k users over one year and demonstrate that there is no blanket answer to the intertwinement of recommendation use and consumption diversity: it depends on users. First we compute for each user the relative importance of different access modes within their listening history, introducing a trichotomy distinguishing so-called ‘organic’ use from algorithmic and editorial guidance. We thereby identify four categories of users. We then focus on two scales related to content diversity, both in terms of dispersion – how much users consume the same content repeatedly – and popularity – how popular is the content they consume. We show that the two types of recommendation offered by music platforms – algorithmic and editorial – may drive the consumption of more or less diverse content in opposite directions, depending also strongly on the type of users. Finally, we compare users’ streaming histories with the music programming of a selection of popular French radio stations during the same period. While radio programs are usually more tilted toward repetition than users’ listening histories, they often program more songs from less popular artists. On the whole, our results highlight the nontrivial effects of platform-mediated recommendation on consumption, and lead us to speak of ‘filter niches’ rather than ‘filter bubbles’. They hint at further ramifications for the study and design of recommendation systems.</p>
