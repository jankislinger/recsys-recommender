    <h3>Global-Local Item Embedding for Temporal Set Prediction (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiun Kim, Minkyu Kim, Young-Jin Park, Jisu Jeong, Seungjae Jung, Hanock Kwak, Kyung-Min Kim</p>
    <p>Temporal set prediction is becoming increasingly important as many companies employ recommender systems in their online businesses, e.g., personalized purchase prediction of shopping baskets. While most previous techniques have focused on leveraging a user’s history, the study of combining it with others’ histories remains untapped potential. This paper proposes Global-Local Item Embedding (GLOIE) that learns to utilize the temporal properties of sets across whole users as well as within a user by coining the names as global and local information to distinguish the two temporal patterns. GLOIE uses Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and dynamic graph-based model to capture global and local information and then applies attention to integrate resulting item embeddings. Additionally, we propose to use Tweedie output for the decoder of VAE as it can easily model zero-inflated and long-tailed distribution, which is more suitable for several real-world data distributions than Gaussian or multinomial counterparts. When evaluated on three public benchmarks, our algorithm consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in most ranking metrics.</p>

    <h3>Context-Regularized Neural Collaborative Filtering for Game App Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shonosuke Harada, Kazuki Taniguchi, Makoto Yamada, Hisashi Kashima</p>
    <p>People spend a substantial amount of time playing games on their smartphones. Owing to growth in the number of newly released games, it is getting more difficult for people to identify which of the broad selection of games they want to play. In this paper, we introduce context-aware recommendation for game apps that combines neural collaborative filtering and item embedding. We find that some contexts special to games are effective in representing item embeddings in implicit feedback situations. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms conventional methods.</p>

    <h3>Multi Cross Domain Recommendation Using Item Embedding And Canonical Correlation Analysis (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Kazama, Istvan Varga</p>
    <p>In a multi-service environment it is crucial to be able to leverage user behavior from one or more domains to create personalized recommendations in the other domain. In our paper, we present a robust transfer learning approach that successfully captures user behavior across multiple domains. First, we vectorize users and items in each domain independently. Second, using a handful of common users across domain pairs, we project each domain vector space into a common vector space using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Next, recommendations can be performed by recommending the items in any domains that are closest to the user’s vector in the common space. We also experimented on what kind of domain combination works well.</p>

    <h3>Item2vec: Neural Item Embedding for Collaborative Filtering (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oren Barkan, Noam Koenigstein</p>
    <p>Many Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms are item-based in the sense that they analyze item-item relations in order to produce item similarities. Recently, several works in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggested to learn a latent representation of words using neural embedding algorithms. Among them, the Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS), also known as Word2vec, was shown to provide state-of-the-art results on various linguistics tasks. In this paper, we show that item-based CF can be cast in the same framework of neural word embedding. Inspired by SGNS, we describe a method we name Item2vec for item-based CF that produces embedding for items in a latent space. The method is capable of inferring item-item relations even when user information is not available. We present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the Item2vec method and show it is competitive with SVD.</p>
