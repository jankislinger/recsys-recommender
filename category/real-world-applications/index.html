    <h3>Learned Ranking Function: From Short-term Behavior Predictions to Long-term User Satisfaction (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Wu, Jennifer She, Daryl Chang, Lukasz Heldt, Zhe Zhao, Li Wei</p>
    <p>We present the Learned Ranking Function (LRF), a system that takes short-term user-item behavior predictions as input and outputs a slate of recommendations directly optimizing for long-term user satisfaction. Most previous work is based on optimizing hyper-parameters of a heuristic function. We propose to model the problem directly as a slate optimization problem with the objective of maximizing long-term user satisfaction. We also develop a new constraint optimization method that is able to improve the stability for multi-objective optimization. We evaluate our approach with live experiments and describe its deployment on YouTube.</p>

    <h3>Pay Attention to Attention for Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaojing Liu, Yuli Liu, Min Liu</p>
    <p>Transformer-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in various sequence-based tasks. However, traditional self-attention models may not sufficiently capture the intricate dependencies within items in sequential recommendation scenarios. This is due to the lack of explicit emphasis on attention weights, which play a critical role in allocating attention and understanding item-to-item correlations. To better exploit the potential of attention weights and improve the capability of sequential recommendation in learning high-order dependencies, we propose a novel sequential recommendation (SR) approach called attention weight refinement (AWRSR). AWRSR enhances the effectiveness of self-attention by additionally paying attention to attention weights, allowing for more refined attention distributions of correlations among items. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SR models. Moreover, we provide a thorough analysis of AWRSR’s effectiveness in capturing higher-level dependencies. These findings suggest that AWRSR offers a promising new direction for enhancing the performance of self-attention architecture in SR tasks, with potential applications in other sequence-based problems as well.</p>

    <h3>Pareto Front Approximation for Multi-Objective Session-Based Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timo Wilm, Philipp Normann, Felix Stepprath</p>
    <p>This work introduces MultiTRON, an approach that adapts Pareto front approximation techniques to multi-objective session-based recommender systems using a transformer neural network. Our approach optimizes trade-offs between key metrics such as click-through and conversion rates by training on sampled preference vectors. A significant advantage is that after training, a single model can access the entire Pareto front, allowing it to be tailored to meet the specific requirements of different stakeholders by adjusting an additional input vector that weights the objectives. We validate the model’s performance through extensive offline and online evaluation. For broader application and research, the source code is made available. The results confirm the model’s ability to manage multiple recommendation objectives effectively, offering a flexible tool for diverse business needs.</p>

    <h3>Informed Dataset Selection with ‘Algorithm Performance Spaces’ (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lien Michiels, Lukas Wegmeth, Joeran Beel, Steffen Schulz</p>
    <p>When designing recommender-systems experiments, a key question that has been largely overlooked is the choice of datasets. In a brief survey of ACM RecSys papers, we found that authors typically justified their dataset choices by labelling them as public, benchmark, or ‘real-world’ without further explanation. We propose the Algorithm Performance Space (APS) as a novel method for informed dataset selection. The APS is an n-dimensional space where each dimension represents the performance of a different algorithm. Each dataset is depicted as an n-dimensional vector, with greater distances indicating higher diversity. In our experiment, we ran 29 algorithms on 95 datasets to construct an actual APS. Our findings show that many datasets, including most Amazon datasets, are clustered closely in the APS, i.e. they are not diverse. However, other datasets, such as MovieLens and Docear, are more dispersed. The APS also enables the grouping of datasets based on the solvability of the underlying problem. Datasets in the top right corner of the APS are considered ’solved problems’ because all algorithms perform well on them. Conversely, datasets in the bottom left corner lack well-performing algorithms, making them ideal candidates for new recommender-system research due to the challenges they present.</p>

    <p>In this demo, we present a prototype tool designed to help financial advisors recommend private pension funds to investors based on their preferences, offering personalized investment suggestions. The tool leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), which enhance explainability by providing clear and understandable rationales for recommendations and effectively handles both sequential and cold-start scenarios. We outline the design, implementation, and results of a user-based evaluation using real-world data. The evaluation shows a high recommendation acceptance rate among financial advisors, highlighting the tool’s potential to improve decision-making in financial advisory services.</p>

    <h3>Reproducibility and Analysis of Scientific Dataset Recommendation Methods (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianmaria Silvello, Matteo Lissandrini, Ornella Irrera, Daniele Dell’Aglio</p>
    <p>Datasets play a central role in scholarly communications. However, scholarly graphs are often incomplete, particularly due to the lack of connections between publications and datasets. Therefore, the importance of dataset recommendation—identifying relevant datasets for a scientific paper, an author, or a textual query—is increasing. Although various methods have been proposed for this task, their reproducibility remains unexplored, making it difficult to compare them with new approaches. We reviewed current recommendation methods for scientific datasets, focusing on the most recent and competitive approaches,  including an SVM-based model, a bi-encoder retriever, a method leveraging co-authors and citation network embeddings, and a heterogeneous variational graph autoencoder.  These approaches underwent a comprehensive analysis under consistent experimental conditions. Our reproducibility efforts show that three methods can be reproduced, while the graph variational autoencoder is challenging due to unavailable code and test datasets.  Hence, we re-implemented this method and performed a component-based analysis to examine its strengths and limitations. Furthermore, our study indicated that three out of four considered methods produce subpar results when applied to real-world data instead of specialized datasets with ad-hoc features.</p>

    <h3>Data Augmentation using Reverse Prompt for Cost-Efficient Cold-Start Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Genki Kusano</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems that use auxiliary information such as product names and categories have been proposed to address the cold-start problem. However, these methods do not perform well when we only have insufficient warm-start training data. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can perform as effective cold-start recommendation systems even with limited warm-start data. However, they require numerous API calls for inferences, which leads to high operational costs in terms of time and money. This is a significant concern in industrial applications. In this paper, we introduce a new method, RevAug, which leverages LLMs as a data augmentation to enhance cost-efficient cold-start recommendation systems. To generate pseudo-samples, we have reversed the commonly used prompt for an LLM from “Would this user like this item?” to “What kind of items would this user like?”. Generated outputs by this reverse prompt are pseudo-auxiliary information utilized to enhance recommendation systems in the training phase. In numerical experiments with four real-world datasets, RevAug demonstrated superior performance in cold-start settings with limited warm-start data compared to existing methods. Moreover, RevAug significantly reduced API fees and processing time compared to an LLM-based recommendation method.</p>

    <h3>MLoRA: Multi-Domain Low-Rank Adaptive Network for CTR Prediction (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Libin Yang, Haining Gao, Wei Ning, Luwei Yang, Zhiming Yang, Dehong Gao, Guannan Zhang, Xiaoyan Cai</p>
    <p>Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is one of the fundamental tasks in the industry, especially in e-commerce, social media, and streaming media. It directly impacts website revenues, user satisfaction, and user retention. However, real-world production platforms often encompass various domains to cater for diverse customer needs. Traditional CTR prediction models struggle in multi-domain recommendation scenarios, facing challenges of data sparsity and disparate data distributions across domains. Existing multi-domain recommendation approaches introduce specific-domain modules for each domain, which partially address these issues but often significantly increase model parameters and lead to insufficient training. In this paper, we propose a Multi-domain Low-Rank Adaptive network (MLoRA) for CTR prediction, where we introduce a specialized LoRA module for each domain. This approach enhances the model’s performance in multi-domain CTR prediction tasks and is able to be applied to various deep-learning models. We evaluate the proposed method on several multi-domain datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our MLoRA approach achieves a significant improvement compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we deploy it in a real-world e-commerce production website. The online A/B testing results indicate the superiority and flexibility in real-world production environments.</p>

    <h3>LLMs for User Interest Exploration: A Hybrid Approach (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> He Ma, Haokai Lu, Yueqi Wang, Yifan Liu, Ed H. Chi, Lexi Baugher, Ningren Han, Shuzhou Zhang, Yang Gu, Jianling Wang, Minmin Chen, Shuchao Bi</p>
    <p>Traditional recommendation systems are subject to a strong feedback loop by learning from and reinforcing past user-item interactions, which in turn limits the discovery of novel user interests. To address this, we introduce a hybrid hierarchical framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and classic recommendation models for user interest exploration. The framework controls the interfacing between the LLMs and the classic recommendation models through “interest clusters”, the granularity of which can be explicitly determined by algorithm designers. It recommends the next novel interests by first representing “interest clusters” using language, and employs a fine-tuned LLM to generate novel interest descriptions that are strictly within these predefined clusters. At the low level, it grounds these generated interests to an item-level policy by restricting classic recommendation models, in this case a transformer-based sequence recommender to return items that fall within the novel clusters generated at the high level. We showcase the efficacy of this approach on an industrial-scale commercial platform serving billions of users. Live experiments show a significant increase in both exploration of novel interests and overall user enjoyment of the platform.</p>

    <h3>Towards Sustainable Recommendations in Urban Tourism (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel Merinov</p>
    <p>In the context of urban tourism promotion, I am exploring how recommender systems (RSs) can personalise information in order to shift tourists behaviour from typically popularity-biased towards more niche and urban-friendly. This problem has a great importance in sustainability online promotion campaigns. Urban destination managers strive to prevent overcrowding at popular points of interest (POIs), by attracting visitors to less popular POIs, while still providing personalised access to information. It is assumed, that this approach will maintain a healthy distribution of tourists in a city; both reducing tourist congestion, and, considering each POI as a local business, maintaining the long-term economic viability in a city. This problem has already received some attention in the literature, targeting major European touristic cities. However, many complex issues still need to be resolved for a comprehensive solution. In this extended abstract, I highlight open research problems, and identify key research questions (RQs) that are crucial for advancing sustainable tourism development leveraging RSs. Although the proposed methods are focused on urban tourism, their application extends to different areas of recommendations because the RQs and the proposed methods and techniques are general.</p>

    <h3>A Novel Evaluation Perspective on GNNs-based Recommender Systems through the Topology of the User-Item Graph (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Carlo Maria Mancino, Vito Walter Anelli, Claudio Pomo, Tommaso Di Noia, Eugenio Di Sciascio, Daniele Malitesta</p>
    <p>Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs)-based recommender systems have encountered great success in recommendation. As the number of GNNs approaches rises, some works have started questioning the theoretical and empirical reasons behind their superior performance. Nevertheless, this investigation still disregards that GNNs treat the recommendation data as a topological graph structure. Building on this assumption, in this work, we provide a novel evaluation perspective on GNNs-based recommendation, which investigates the impact of the graph topology on the recommendation performance. To this end, we select some (topological) properties of the recommendation data and three GNNs-based recommender systems (i.e., LightGCN, DGCF, and SVD-GCN). Then, starting from three popular recommendation datasets (i.e., Yelp2018, Gowalla, and Amazon-Book) we sample them to obtain 1,800 size-reduced datasets that still resemble the original ones but can encompass a wider range of topological structures. We use this procedure to build a large pool of samples for which data characteristics and recommendation performance of the selected GNNs models are measured. Through an explanatory framework, we find strong correspondences between graph topology and GNNs performance, offering a novel evaluation perspective on these models.</p>

    <h3>Powerful A/B-Testing Metrics and Where to Find Them (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shubham Baweja, Aleksei Ustimenko, Neeti Pokharna, Olivier Jeunen</p>
    <p>Online controlled experiments, colloquially known as A/B-tests, are the bread and butter of real-world recommender system evaluation. Typically, end-users are randomly assigned some system variant, and a plethora of metrics are then tracked, collected, and aggregated throughout the experiment. A North Star metric (e.g. long-term growth or revenue) is used to assess which system variant should be deemed superior. As a result, most collected metrics are <i>supporting</i> in nature, and serve to either (i) provide an understanding of how the experiment impacts user experience, or (ii) allow for confident decision-making when the North Star metric moves insignificantly (i.e. a false negative or type-II error). The latter is not straightforward: suppose a treatment variant leads to fewer but longer sessions, with more views but fewer engagements; should this be considered a positive or negative outcome? The question then becomes: how do we assess a supporting metric’s utility when it comes to decision-making using A/B-testing?Online platforms typically run dozens of experiments at any given time. This provides a wealth of information about interventions and treatment effects that can be used to evaluate metrics’ utility for online evaluation. We propose to collect this information and leverage it to quantify type-I, type-II, and type-III errors for the metrics of interest, alongside a distribution of measurements of their statistical power (e.g. $z$-scores and $p$-values). We present results and insights from building this pipeline at scale for two large-scale short-video platforms: ShareChat and Moj; leveraging hundreds of past experiments to find online metrics with high statistical power.</p>

    <h3>A Multi-modal Modeling Framework for Cold-start Short-video Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Gai, Han Li, Ruina Sun, Jingjian Lin, Xinghua Zhang, Gaode Chen, Qi Zhang, Jiangxia Cao, Yuezihan Jiang</p>
    <p>Short video has witnessed rapid growth in the past few years in multimedia platforms. To ensure the freshness of the videos, platforms receive a large number of user-uploaded videos every day, making collaborative filtering-based recommender methods suffer from the item cold-start problem (e.g., the new-coming videos are difficult to compete with existing videos). Consequently, increasing efforts tackle the cold-start issue from the content perspective, focusing on modeling the multi-modal preferences of users, a fair way to compete with new-coming and existing videos. However, recent studies ignore the existing gap between multi-modal embedding extraction and user interest modeling as well as the discrepant intensities of user preferences for different modalities. In this paper, we propose M3CSR, a multi-modal modeling framework for cold-start short video recommendation. Specifically, we preprocess content-oriented multi-modal features for items and obtain trainable category IDs by performing clustering. In each modality, we combine modality-specific cluster ID embedding and the mapped original modality feature as modality-specific representation of the item to address the gap. Meanwhile, M3CSR measures the user modality-specific intensity based on the correlation between modality-specific interest and behavioral interest and employs pairwise loss to further decouple user multi-modal interests. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model. The framework has been deployed on a billion-user scale short video application and has shown improvements in various commercial metrics within cold-start scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Context-based Entity Recommendation for Knowledge Workers: Establishing a Benchmark on Real-life Data (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahta Bakhshizadeh, Heiko Maus, Andreas Dengel</p>
    <p>In recent decades, recommender systems have undergone significant advancements, particularly in popular domains like movies, music, and product recommendations. Yet, progress has been notably slower in leveraging these systems for personal information management and knowledge assistance. In addition to challenges that complicate the adoption of recommender systems in this domain (such as privacy concerns, heterogeneous recommendation items, and frequent context switching), a significant barrier to progress in this area has been the absence of a standardized benchmark for researchers to evaluate their approaches. In response to this gap, this paper presents a benchmark built upon a publicly available dataset of real-life knowledge work in context (RLKWiC). This benchmark focuses on evaluating context-based entity recommendation, a use case for leveraging recommender systems to support knowledge workers in their daily digital tasks. By providing this benchmark, it is aimed to facilitate and accelerate research efforts in enhancing personal knowledge assistance through recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>End-to-End Cost-Effective Incentive Recommendation under Budget Constraint with Uplift Modeling (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunpeng Weng, Xiuqiang He, Hao Yang, Dugang Liu, Xing Tang, Zexu Sun</p>
    <p>In modern online platforms, incentive (<i>e.g</i>., discounts, bonus) are essential factors that enhance user engagement and increase platform revenue. Over recent years, uplift modeling has been introduced as a strategic approach to assign incentive to individual customers. Especially, in many real-world applications, online platforms can only incentivize customers with specific budget constraints. This problem can be reformulated as the multi-choice knapsack problem (MCKP). The objective of this optimization is to select the optimal incentive for each customer in order to maximize the return-on-investment (ROI). Recent works in this field frequently tackle the problem of budget allocation using a two-stage approach. %: the first stage utilizes causal inference algorithms to estimate the individual treatment effect or uplift, while the second stage employs integer programming techniques to determine the optimal solution for budget allocation. However, this solution is confronted with the following challenges: (1) The commonly used causal inference methods often ignore the domain knowledge in online marketing, where the expected response curve of a customer should be monotonic and smooth as the incentive increases. (2) There is an optimality gap between the two stages, resulting in inferior sub-optimal allocation performance, which is due to the loss of the incentive recommendation information for the uplift prediction under the limited budget constraint. To address these challenges, we propose a novel <u>E</u>nd-to-<u>E</u>nd Cost-<u>E</u>ffective <u>I</u>ncentive <u>R</u>ecommendation (E$^3$IR) model under the budget constraint. Specifically, our methods consist of two modules: the uplift prediction module and the differentiable allocation module. In the uplift prediction module, we construct prediction heads to capture the incremental improvement between adjacent treatments with the marketing domain constraints (<i>i.e.</i>, monotonic and smooth). %To obtain a monotonic user response curve, we constrain the output of each prediction head to be non-negative. In the differentiable allocation module, we incorporate integer linear programming (ILP) as a differentiable layer input. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on both public and real product datasets, which demonstrate that our E$^3$IR improves allocation performance compared to existing two-stage approaches.</p>
