    <h3>Re2Dan: Retrieval of medical documents for e-Health in Danish (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafael Pablos, Ira Assent, Antonela Tommasel</p>
    <p>With the clinical environment becoming more data-reliant, healthcare professionals now have unparalleled access to comprehensive clinical information from numerous sources. Then, one of the main issues is how to avoid overloading practitioners with large amounts of (irrelevant) information while guiding them to the relevant documents for specific patient cases. Additional challenges appear due to the shortness of queries and the presence of long (and maybe noisy) contextual information. This demo presents Re2Dan, a web Retrieval and recommender of Danish medical documents. Re2Dan leverages several techniques to improve the quality of retrieved documents. First, it combines lexical and semantic searches to understand the meaning and context of user queries, allowing the retrieval of documents that are conceptually similar to the user’s query. Second, it recommends similar queries, allowing users to discover related documents and insights. Third, when given contextual information (e.g., from patients’ clinical notes), it suggests medical concepts to expand the user query, enabling a more focused search scope and thus obtaining more accurate recommendations. Preliminary analyses showed the effectiveness of the recommender in improving the relevance and comprehensiveness of recommendations, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in finding relevant information for informed decision-making.</p>

    <h3>Traversing Semantically Annotated Queries for Task-oriented Query Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Câmara, Rodrygo L. T. Santos</p>
    <p>As search systems gradually turn into intelligent personal assistants, users increasingly resort to a search engine to accomplish a complex task, such as planning a trip, renting an apartment, or investing in stocks. A key challenge for the search engine is to understand the user’s underlying task given a sample query like ‘tickets to panama’, ‘studios in los angeles’, or ‘spotify stocks’, and to suggest other queries to help the user complete the task. In this paper, we investigate several strategies for query recommendation by traversing a semantically annotated query log using a mixture of explicit and latent representations of entire queries and of query segments. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in terms of utility and diversity, as well as their complementarity, with significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art query recommendation baselines adapted for this task. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Task-Based User Modelling for Personalization via Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Mehrotra, Emine Yilmaz, Manisha Verma</p>
    <p>We introduce a novel approach to user modelling for behavioral targeting: task-based user representation and present an approach based on search task extraction from search logs wherein users are represented by their actions over a task-space. Given a web search log, we extract search tasks performed by users and nd user representations based on these tasks. More specically, we construct a user-task association matrix and borrow insights from Collaborative Filtering to learn low-dimensional factor model wherein the interests/preferences of a user are determined by a small number of latent factors. We compare the performance of the proposed approach on the task of collaborative query recommendation on publicly available AOL search log with a standard term-similarity baseline and discuss potential future research directions.</p>
