    <h3>Deep Bayesian Bandits: Exploring in Online Personalized Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dalin Guo, Sourav Das, Michael Kneier, Pranay Kumar Kumar Myana, Alykhan Tejani, Sofia Ira Ira Ktena, Ferenc Huszar, Wenzhe Shi</p>
    <p>Recommender systems trained in a continuous learning fashion are plagued by the feedback loop problem, also known as algorithmic bias. This causes a newly trained model to act greedily and favor items that have already been engaged by users. This behavior is particularly harmful in personalised ads recommendations, as it can also cause new campaigns to remain unexplored. Exploration aims to address this limitation by providing new information about the environment, which encompasses user preference, and can lead to higher long-term reward. In this work, we formulate a display advertising recommender as a contextual bandit and implement exploration techniques that require sampling from the posterior distribution of click-through-rates in a computationally tractable manner. Traditional large-scale deep learning models do not provide uncertainty estimates by default. We approximate these uncertainty measurements of the predictions by employing a bootstrapped model with multiple heads and dropout units. We benchmark a number of different models in an offline simulation environment using a publicly available dataset of user-ads engagements. We test our proposed deep Bayesian bandits algorithm in the offline simulation and online AB setting with large-scale production traffic, where we demonstrate a positive gain of our exploration model.</p>

    <h3>Theoretical Modeling of the Iterative Properties of User Discovery in a Collaborative Filtering Recommender System (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boujelbene Mariem, Olfa Nasraoui, Sami Khenissi</p>
    <p>The closed feedback loop in recommender systems is a common setting that can lead to different types of biases. Several studies have dealt with these biases by designing methods to mitigate their effect on the recommendations. However, most existing studies do not consider the iterative behavior of the system where the closed feedback loop plays a crucial role in incorporating different biases into several parts of the recommendation steps.<br>We present a theoretical framework to model the asymptotic evolution of the different components of a recommender system operating within a feedback loop setting, and derive theoretical bounds and convergence properties on quantifiable measures of the user discovery and blind spots. We also validate our theoretical findings empirically using a real-life dataset and empirically test the efficiency of a basic exploration strategy within our theoretical framework.<br>Our findings lay the theoretical basis for quantifying the effect of feedback loops and for designing Artificial Intelligence and machine learning algorithms that explicitly incorporate the iterative nature of feedback loops in the machine learning and recommendation process.</p>

    <h3>Multi-Armed Recommender System Bandit Ensembles (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcos Redondo, Rocío Cañamares, Pablo Castells</p>
    <p>It has long been found that well-configured recommender system ensembles can achieve better effectiveness than the combined systems separately. Sophisticated approaches have been developed to automatically optimize the ensembles’ configuration to maximize their performance gains. However most work in this area has targeted simplified scenarios where algorithms are tested and compared on a single non-interactive run. In this paper we consider a more realistic perspective bearing in mind the cyclic nature of the recommendation task, where a large part of the system’s input is collected from the reaction of users to the recommendations they are delivered. The cyclic process provides the opportunity for ensembles to observe and learn about the effectiveness of the combined algorithms, and improve the ensemble configuration progressively. In this paper we explore the adaptation of a multi-armed bandit approach to achieve this, by representing the combined systems as arms, and the ensemble as a bandit that at each step selects an arm to produce the next round of recommendations. We report experiments showing the effectiveness of this approach compared to ensembles that lack the iterative perspective. Along the way, we find illustrative pitfall examples that can result from common, single-shot offline evaluation setups. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>
