    <h3>ClusterExplorer: Enable User Control over Related Recommendations via Collaborative Filtering and Clustering (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kati Launis, Denis Kotkov, Mats Neovius, Qian Zhao</p>
    <p>Related item recommendations have a long history in recommender systems, but they tend to be a static list of similar items with respect to a target item of interest without any support of user control. In this paper, we propose ClusterExplorer, a novel approach for enabling user control over related recommendations. The approach allows users to explore the latent space of user-item interactions through controlling related recommendations. We evaluated ClusterExplorer in the book domain with 42 participants recruited in a public library and found that our approach has higher user satisfaction of browsing items and is more helpful in finding interesting items compared to traditional related item recommendations.</p>

    <h3>A Field Study of Related Video Recommendations: Newest, Most Similar, or Most Relevant (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Maxwell Harper, Yifan Zhong, Qian Zhao, Vikas Kumar, Tahir Lazaro Sousa Menezes</p>
    <p>Many video sites recommend videos related to the one a user is watching. These recommendations have been shown to influence what users end up exploring and are an important part of a recommender system. Plenty of methods have been proposed to recommend related videos, but there has been relatively little work that compares competing strategies. We describe a field study of related video recommendations, where we deploy algorithms to recommend related videos in a movie trailer viewing interface. Our results show that non-personalized algorithms yield the highest click-through rates, while the algorithm prioritizing recency is the strongest in leading to trailer-level user engagement. Our findings suggest the potential to design non-personalized yet effective related item recommendation strategies.</p>

    <h3>Judging Similarity: A User-Centric Study of Related Item Recommendations (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Yao, F. Maxwell Harper</p>
    <p>Related item recommenders operate in the context of a particular item. For instance, a music systemâ€™s page about the artist Radiohead might recommend other similar artists such as The Flaming Lips. Often central to these recommendations is the computation of similarity between pairs of items. Prior work has explored many algorithms and features that allow for the computation of similarity scores, but little work has evaluated these approaches from a user-centric perspective. In this work, we build and evaluate six similarity scoring algorithms that span a range of activity- and content-based approaches. We evaluate the performance of these algorithms using both offline metrics and a new set of more than 22,000 user-contributed evaluations. We integrate these results with a survey of more than 700 participants concerning their expectations about item similarity and related item recommendations. We find that content-based algorithms outperform ratings- and clickstream-based algorithms in terms of how well they match user expectations for similarity and recommendation quality. Our results yield a number of implications to guide the construction of related item recommendation algorithms.</p>
