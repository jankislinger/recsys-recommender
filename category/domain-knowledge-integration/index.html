    <h3>Generic Automated Lead Ranking in Dynamics CRM (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Royi Ronen, Edan Hauon, Gopal Kasturi, AJ Ezzour, Oron Nir, Hilik Berezin, Rotem Preizler, Sayalee Bhanavase</p>
    <p>We developed a generic framework which enables Customer Relationship Management (CRM) organizations to deploy an automated ranking system for leads (commonly known as ‘lead scoring’). Leads are records that represent non-customers who might become customers. Lead ranking is a fundamental CRM problem with many flavors. Ranking serves as a prioritization management tool for CRM organizations, with many characteristics similar to those of recommender systems.<br>We present the system with its most recent developments, emphasizing challenges that go beyond the core of the learning algorithm, and that have played an instrumental role in maturing the system into a trustable feature, robust to different types of organizations and datasets. Particularly, we present features which enable Human in the Loop [1], a dominant concept in both configuration and result consumption. Another type of features demonstrates the addition of domain knowledge into the machine learning based process.<br>We present the concepts of feature selection, with and without human help, prediction explanations, insights on model inputs, data quality issues, training for UX consistency, and actionability for each individual prediction.</p>

    <h3>Sustainability at Scale: Bridging the Intention-Behavior Gap with Sustainable Recommendations (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lise Getoor, Ben London, Steven Isley, Sabina Tomkins</p>
    <p>We present an approach for jointly discovering sustainable products and sustainability-minded customers while making recommendations informed by these discoveries. Identifying sustainable products, and the customers who are interested in purchasing them, can improve customer satisfaction while also having a potentially large positive environmental impact. Finding sustainable products and evaluating their claims is a significant barrier facing sustainability-minded customers. Tools that reduce both these burdens are likely to boost the sale of sustainable products. However, it is difficult to determine the sustainability characteristics of these products — there are a variety of certifications and definitions of sustainability, and quality labeling requires input from domain experts. In this paper, we propose a flexible probabilistic framework that uses domain knowledge to identify sustainable products and customers, and uses these labels to predict customer purchases. We evaluate our approach on grocery items from the Amazon catalog. Our proposed approach outperforms established recommender system models in predicting future purchases while jointly inferring sustainability scores for customers and products.</p>
