    <h3>Learning Personalized Health Recommendations via Offline Reinforcement Learning (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Larry Preuett</p>
    <p>The healthcare industry is strained and would benefit from personalized treatment plans for treating various health conditions (e.g., HIV and diabetes). Reinforcement Learning is a promising approach to learning such sequential recommendation systems. However, applying reinforcement learning in the medical domain is challenging due to the lack of adequate evaluation metrics, partial observability, and the inability to explore due to safety concerns. In this line of work, we identify three research directions to improve the applicability of treatment plans learned using offline reinforcement learning.</p>

    <h3>Integrating Offline Reinforcement Learning with Transformers for Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xumei Xi, Yang Wu, Liwen Ouyang, Yuke Zhao, Quan Liu</p>
    <p>We consider the problem of sequential recommendation, where the current recommendation is made based on past interactions. This recommendation task requires efficient processing of the sequential data and aims to provide recommendations that maximize the long-term reward. To this end, we train a farsighted recommender by using an offline RL algorithm with the policy network in our model architecture that has been initialized from a pre-trained transformer model. The pre-trained model leverages the superb ability of the transformer to process sequential information. Compared to prior works that rely on online interaction via simulation, we focus on implementing a fully offline RL framework that is able to converge in a fast and stable way. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we show that our method is robust across various recommendation regimes, including e-commerce and movie suggestions. Compared to state-of-the-art supervised learning algorithms, our algorithm yields recommendations of higher quality, demonstrating the clear advantage of combining RL and transformers.</p>

    <h3>Off-Policy Actor Critic for Recommender Systems (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minmin Chen, Can Xu, Aviral Kumar, Ed Chi, Vince Gatto, Devanshu Jain</p>
    <p>Industrial recommendation platforms are increasingly concerned with how to make recommendations that cause users to enjoy their long term experience on the platform. Reinforcement learning emerged naturally as an appealing approach for its promise in 1) combating feedback loop effect resulted from myopic system behaviors; and 2) sequential planning to optimize long term outcome. Scaling RL algorithms to production recommender systems serving billions of users and contents, however remain challenging. Sample inefficiency and instability of online RL hinder its widespread adoption in production. Offline RL enables usage of off-policy data and batch learning. It on the other hand faces significant challenges in learning due to the distribution shift.<br>A REINFORCE agent [3] was successfully tested for YouTube recommendation, significantly outperforming a sophisticated supervised learning production system. Off-policy correction was employed to learn from logged data. The algorithm partially mitigates the distribution shift by employing a one-step importance weighting. We resort to the off-policy actor critic algorithms to addresses the distribution shift to a better extent. Here we share the key designs in setting up an off-policy actor-critic agent for production recommender systems. It extends  [3] with a critic network that estimates the value of any state-action pairs under the target learned policy through temporal difference learning. We demonstrate in offline and live experiments that the new framework out-performs baseline and improves long term user experience.<br>An interesting discovery along our investigation is that recommendation agents that employ a softmax policy parameterization, can end up being too pessimistic about out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Finding the right balance between pessimism and optimism on OOD actions is critical to the success of offline RL for recommender systems.</p>
