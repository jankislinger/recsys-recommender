    <h3>Improving Data Efficiency for Recommenders and LLMs (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Caverlee, Noveen Sachdeva, Jianmo Ni, Benjamin Coleman, Ed Chi, Lichan Hong, Wang-Cheng Kang, Derek Cheng</p>
    <p>In recent years, massive transformer-based architectures have driven breakthrough performance in practical applications like autoregressive text-generation (LLMs) and click-prediction (recommenders). A common recipe for success is to train large models on massive web-scale datasets, e.g., modern recommenders are trained on billions of user-item click events, and LLMs are trained on trillions of tokens extracted from the public internet. We are close to hitting the computational and economical limits of scaling up the size of these models, and we expect the next frontier of gains to come from improving the: (i) data quality of the training dataset, and (ii) data efficiency of the extremely expensive training procedure. Inspired by this shift, we present a set of “data-centric” techniques for recommendation and language models that summarizes a dataset into a terse data summary, which is both (i) high-quality, i.e., trains better quality models, and (ii) improves the data-efficiency of the overall training procedure. We propose techniques from two disparate data frameworks: (i) data selection (a.k.a., coreset construction) methods that sample portions of the dataset using grounded heuristics, and(ii) data distillation techniques that generate synthetic examples which are optimized to retain the signals needed for training high-quality models. Overall, this work sheds light on the challenges and opportunities offered by data optimization in web-scale systems, a particularly relevant focus as the recommendation community grapples with the grand challenge of leveraging LLMs.</p>

    <h3>Interface Design to Mitigate Inflation in Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rana Shahout, Nikhil Garg, Sasha Stoikov, Yehonatan Peisakhovsky</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems rely on user-provided data to learn about item quality and provide personalized recommendations. An implicit assumption when aggregating ratings into item quality is that ratings are strong indicators of item quality. In this work, we analyze this assumption using data collected from a music discovery application. Our study focuses on two factors that cause rating inflation: heterogeneous user rating behavior and the dynamics of personalized recommendations. We show that user rating behavior is significantly variable, leading to item quality estimates that reflect the users who rated an item more than the item quality itself. Additionally, items that are more likely to be shown via personalized recommendations can experience a substantial increase in their exposure and potential bias toward them. To mitigate these effects, we conducted a randomized controlled trial where the rating interface was modified. This resulted in a substantial improvement in user rating behavior and a reduction in item quality inflation. These findings highlight the importance of carefully considering the assumptions underlying recommendation systems and designing interfaces that encourage accurate rating behavior.</p>

    <h3>Generic Automated Lead Ranking in Dynamics CRM (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Royi Ronen, Edan Hauon, Gopal Kasturi, AJ Ezzour, Oron Nir, Hilik Berezin, Rotem Preizler, Sayalee Bhanavase</p>
    <p>We developed a generic framework which enables Customer Relationship Management (CRM) organizations to deploy an automated ranking system for leads (commonly known as ‘lead scoring’). Leads are records that represent non-customers who might become customers. Lead ranking is a fundamental CRM problem with many flavors. Ranking serves as a prioritization management tool for CRM organizations, with many characteristics similar to those of recommender systems.<br>We present the system with its most recent developments, emphasizing challenges that go beyond the core of the learning algorithm, and that have played an instrumental role in maturing the system into a trustable feature, robust to different types of organizations and datasets. Particularly, we present features which enable Human in the Loop [1], a dominant concept in both configuration and result consumption. Another type of features demonstrates the addition of domain knowledge into the machine learning based process.<br>We present the concepts of feature selection, with and without human help, prediction explanations, insights on model inputs, data quality issues, training for UX consistency, and actionability for each individual prediction.</p>

    <h3>Data Quality Matters in Recommender Systems (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shlomo Berkovsky, Royi Ronen, Amir Amihood, Oren Sar Shalom, Elad Ziklik</p>
    <p>Although data quality has been recognized as an important factor in the broad information systems research, it has received little attention in recommender systems. Data quality matters are typically addressed in recommenders by ad-hoc cleansing methods, which prune noisy or unreliable records from the data. However, the setting of the cleansing parameters is often done arbitrarily, without thorough consideration of the data characteristics. In this work, we turn to two central data quality problems in recommender systems: sparsity and redundancy. We devise models for setting data-dependent thresholds and sampling levels, and evaluate these using a collection of public and proprietary datasets. We observe that the models accurately predict data cleansing parameters, while having minor effect on the accuracy of the generated recommendations.</p>
