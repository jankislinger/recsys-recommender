    <h3>Two-sided Calibration for Quality-aware Responsible Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min Zhang, Chao Deng, Yiqun Liu, Haitao Zeng, Yankai Liu, Yuanqing Yu, Chenyang Wang, Weizhi Ma, Junlan Feng</p>
    <p>Calibration in recommender systems ensures that the user’s interests distribution over groups of items is reflected with their corresponding proportions in the recommendation, which has gained increasing attention recently. For example, a user who watched 80 entertainment videos and 20 knowledge videos is expected to receive recommendations comprising about 80% entertainment and 20% knowledge videos as well.  However, with the increasing calls for quality-aware responsible recommendation, it has become inadequate to just match users’ historical behaviors, which could still lead to undesired effects at the system level (e.g., overwhelming clickbaits). In this paper, we envision the two-sided calibration task that not only matches the users’ past interests distribution (user-level calibration) but also guarantees an overall target exposure distribution of different item groups (system-level calibration).  The target group exposure distribution can be explicitly pursued by users, platform owners, and even the law (e.g., the platform owners expect about 50% knowledge video recommendation on the whole). To support this scenario, we propose a post-processing method named PCT. PCT first solves personalized calibration targets that minimize the changes in users’ historical interest distributions while ensuring the overall target group exposure distribution. Then, PCT reranks the original recommendation lists according to personalized calibration targets to generate both relevant and two-sided calibrated recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to calibrated and fairness-aware recommendation approaches. We also release a new dataset with item quality annotations to support further studies about quality-aware responsible recommendation.</p>
