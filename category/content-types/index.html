    <h3>Towards Understanding The Gaps of Offline And Online Evaluation Metrics: Impact of Series vs. Movie Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashok Chandrashekar, Puja Das, Bora Edizel, Tim Sweetser, Kamilia Ahmadi</p>
    <p>In the realm of recommender systems research, offline evaluation metrics like NDCG, Recall, or Precision are often used to measure the impact. On the other hand, common industry practices suggest evaluating new ideas/models through A/B tests where decisions are made based on business metrics like the overall engagement of users. A new model may show improvement in offline metrics but performance loss in online metrics. One reason that leads to this phenomenon is the counterfactual nature of the recommendation problem which can be addressed by off-policy evaluation methods. Another reason is the degree of causal connection between offline evaluation metrics and observed online metrics. In this work, we will share our learnings from two sets of A/B tests that we conducted at Max1 where we observed a mismatch between online and offline metrics due to a weak causal connection between online and offline metrics. Thanks to learnings from A/B tests, we discovered and quantified the impact of series to movie ratio at recommendations. Our experiments show that there is an optimal amount of series to movies ratio that provides the best possible results for user engagement</p>

    <h3>Ranking Across Different Content Types: The Robust Beauty of Multinomial Blending (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Malte Lichtenberg, Giuseppe Di Benedetto, Matteo Ruffini</p>
    <p>An increasing number of media streaming services have expanded their offerings to include entities of multiple content types. For instance, audio streaming services that started by offering music only, now also offer podcasts, merchandise items, and (music) videos. Ranking items across different content types into a single slate poses a significant challenge for traditional learning-to-rank (LTR) algorithms due to differing feature sets and user engagement patterns for different content types. We explore a simple method, called multinomial blending (MB), which can be used in conjunction with most existing LTR algorithms. We compare MB to a range of baselines not only in terms of ranking quality but also from other industry-relevant perspectives such as interpretability, ease-of-use, and stability in dynamic online-learning environments.</p>
