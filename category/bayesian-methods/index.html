    <h3>Topic-Level Bayesian Surprise and Serendipity for Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Razvan Bunescu, Tonmoy Hasan</p>
    <p>A recommender system that optimizes its recommendations solely to fit a user’s history of ratings for consumed items can create a filter bubble, wherein the user does not get to experience items from novel, unseen categories. One approach to mitigate this undesired behavior is to recommend items with high potential for serendipity, namely surprising items that are likely to be highly rated. In this paper, we propose a content-based formulation of serendipity that is rooted in Bayesian surprise and use it to measure the serendipity of items after they are consumed and rated by the user. When coupled with a collaborative-filtering component that identifies similar users, this enables recommending items with high potential for serendipity. To facilitate the evaluation of topic-level models for surprise and serendipity, we introduce a dataset of book reading histories extracted from Goodreads, containing over 26 thousand users and close to 1.3 million books, where we manually annotate 450 books read by 4 users in terms of their time-dependent, topic-level surprise. Experimental evaluations show that models that use Bayesian surprise correlate much better with the manual annotations of topic-level surprise than distance-based heuristics, and also obtain better serendipitous item recommendation performance.</p>

    <h3>Pessimistic Reward Models for Off-Policy Learning in Recommendation (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Jeunen, Bart Goethals</p>
    <p>Methods for bandit learning from user interactions often require a model of the reward a certain context-action pair will yield – for example, the probability of a click on a recommendation. This common machine learning task is highly non-trivial, as the data-generating process for contexts and actions is often skewed by the recommender system itself. Indeed, when the deployed recommendation policy at data collection time does not pick its actions uniformly-at-random, this leads to a selection bias that can impede effective reward modelling. This in turn makes off-policy learning – the typical setup in industry – particularly challenging.<br>In this work, we propose and validate a general pessimistic reward modelling approach for off-policy learning in recommendation. Bayesian uncertainty estimates allow us to express scepticism about our own reward model, which can in turn be used to generate a conservative decision rule. We show how it alleviates a well-known decision making phenomenon known as the Optimiser’s Curse, and draw parallels with existing work on pessimistic policy learning. Leveraging the available closed-form expressions for both the posterior mean and variance when a ridge regressor models the reward, we show how to apply pessimism effectively and efficiently to an off-policy recommendation use-case. Empirical observations in a wide range of environments show that being conservative in decision-making leads to a significant and robust increase in recommendation performance. The merits of our approach are most outspoken in realistic settings with limited logging randomisation, limited training samples, and larger action spaces.</p>

    <h3>Deep Bayesian Bandits: Exploring in Online Personalized Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dalin Guo, Sourav Das, Michael Kneier, Pranay Kumar Kumar Myana, Alykhan Tejani, Sofia Ira Ira Ktena, Ferenc Huszar, Wenzhe Shi</p>
    <p>Recommender systems trained in a continuous learning fashion are plagued by the feedback loop problem, also known as algorithmic bias. This causes a newly trained model to act greedily and favor items that have already been engaged by users. This behavior is particularly harmful in personalised ads recommendations, as it can also cause new campaigns to remain unexplored. Exploration aims to address this limitation by providing new information about the environment, which encompasses user preference, and can lead to higher long-term reward. In this work, we formulate a display advertising recommender as a contextual bandit and implement exploration techniques that require sampling from the posterior distribution of click-through-rates in a computationally tractable manner. Traditional large-scale deep learning models do not provide uncertainty estimates by default. We approximate these uncertainty measurements of the predictions by employing a bootstrapped model with multiple heads and dropout units. We benchmark a number of different models in an offline simulation environment using a publicly available dataset of user-ads engagements. We test our proposed deep Bayesian bandits algorithm in the offline simulation and online AB setting with large-scale production traffic, where we demonstrate a positive gain of our exploration model.</p>

    <h3>A Hierarchical Bayesian Model for Size Recommendation in Fashion (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuen King Ho, Abdul-Saboor Sheikh, Evgenyi Koryagin, Reza Shirvany, Urs Bergmann, Romain Guigourès</p>
    <p>We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian approach to tackle the challenging problem of size recommendation in e-commerce fashion. Our approach jointly models a size purchased by a customer, and its possible return event: 1. no return, 2. returned too small 3. returned too big. Those events are drawn following a multinomial distribution parameterized on the joint probability of each event, built following a hierarchy combining priors. Such a model allows us to incorporate extended domain expertise and article characteristics as prior knowledge, which in turn makes it possible for the underlying parameters to emerge thanks to sufficient data. Experiments are presented on real (anonymized) data from millions of customers along with a detailed discussion on the efficiency of such an approach within a large scale production system.</p>

    <h3>Bayesian Low-Rank Determinantal Point Processes (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noam Koenigstein, Ulrich Paquet, Mike Gartrell</p>
    <p>Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are an emerging model for encoding probabilities over subsets, such as shopping baskets, selected from a ground set, such as an item catalog. They have recently proved to be appealing models for a number of machine learning tasks, including product recommendation. DPPs are parametrized by a positive semi-definite kernel matrix. Prior work has shown that using a low-rank factorization of this kernel provides scalability improvements that open the door to training on large-scale datasets and computing online recommendations, both of which are infeasible with standard DPP models that use a full-rank kernel. A low-rank DPP model can be trained using an optimization-based method, such as stochastic gradient ascent, to find a point estimate of the kernel parameters, which can be performed efficiently on large-scale datasets. However, this approach requires careful tuning of regularization parameters to prevent overfitting and provide good predictive performance, which can be computationally expensive. In this paper we present a Bayesian method for learning a low-rank factorization of this kernel, which provides automatic control of regularization. We show that our Bayesian low-rank DPP model can be trained efficiently using stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC). Our Bayesian model generally provides better predictive performance on several real-world product recommendation datasets than optimization-based low-rank DPP models trained using stochastic gradient ascent, and better performance than several state-of-the art recommendation methods in many cases.</p>

    <h3>Efficient Bayesian Methods for Graph-based Recommendation (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrygo L. T. Santos, Renato Assunção, Ramon Lopes</p>
    <p>Short-length random walks on the bipartite user-item graph have recently been shown to provide accurate and diverse recommendations. Nonetheless, these approaches suffer from severe time and space requirements, which can be alleviated via random walk sampling, at the cost of reduced recommendation quality. In addition, these approaches ignore users’ ratings, which further limits their expressiveness. In this paper, we introduce a computationally efficient graph-based approach for collaborative filtering based on short-path enumeration. Moreover, we propose three scoring functions based on the Bayesian paradigm that effectively exploit distributional aspects of the users’ ratings. We experiment with seven publicly available datasets against state-of-the-art graph-based and matrix factorization approaches. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant improvements in most settings. Furthermore, analytical results demonstrate its efficiency compared to other graph-based approaches.</p>

    <h3>Adaptive, Personalized Diversity for Visual Discovery (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijai Mohan, Mitchell Goodman, Choon Hui Teo, S. V. N. Vishwanathan, Daniel Hill, Houssam Nassif, Sriram Srinivasan</p>
    <p>Search queries are appropriate when users have explicit intent, but they perform poorly when the intent is difficult to express or if the user is simply looking to be inspired. Visual browsing systems allow e-commerce platforms to address these scenarios while offering the user an engaging shopping experience. Here we explore extensions in the direction of adaptive personalization and item diversification within Stream, a new form of visual browsing and discovery by Amazon. Our system presents the user with a diverse set of interesting items while adapting to user interactions. Our solution consists of three components (1) a Bayesian regression model for scoring the relevance of items while leveraging uncertainty, (2) a submodular diversification framework that re-ranks the top scoring items based on category, and (3) personalized category preferences learned from the user’s behavior. When tested on live traffic, our algorithms show a strong lift in click-through-rate and session duration.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation from Intransitive Pairwise Comparisons (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elja Arjas, Marta Crispino, Arnoldo Frigessi, Valeria Vitelli</p>
    <p>In this poster we propose a full Bayesian probabilistic method to learn preferences from non-transitive pairwise comparison data. Such lack of transitivity easily arises when the number of pairwise comparisons is large, and they are given sequentially without allowing for consistency check. We develop a Bayesian Mallows model able to handle such data through a latent layer of uncertainty which captures the generation of preference misreporting. We then construct an MCMC algorithm, and test the procedure on simulated data.</p>

    <h3>Using Navigation to Improve Recommendations in Real-Time (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander J Smola, Justin Basilico, Christopher V Alvino, Chao-Yuan Wu</p>
    <p>Implicit feedback is a key source of information for many recommendation and personalization approaches. However, using it typically requires multiple episodes of interaction and roundtrips to a recommendation engine. This adds latency and neglects the opportunity of immediate personalization for a user the user is navigating recommendations. We propose a novel strategy to address the above problem in a principled manner. The key insight is that as we observe a user’s interactions, it reveals much more information about her desires. We exploit this by inferring the within-session user intent based on navigation interactions, since they offer valuable clues into a user’s current state of mind. Using navigation patterns and adapting recommendations in real-time creates an opportunity to provide more accurate recommendations. By prefetching a larger amount of content, this can be carried out entirely in the client (such as a browser) without added latency. We define a new Bayesian model with an efficient inference algorithm. We demonstrate significant improvements with this novel approach on a real-world, large-scale dataset from Netflix on the problem of adapting the recommendations on a user’s homepage.</p>

    <h3>Uncovering Systematic Bias in Ratings across Categories: a Bayesian Approach (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David B. Dunson, Fangjian Guo</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are routinely equipped with standardized taxonomy that associates each item with one or more categories or genres. Although such information does not directly imply the quality of an item, the distribution of ratings vary greatly across categories, e.g. animation movies may generally receive higher ratings than action movies. While it is a natural outcome given the diversity and heterogeneity of both users and items, it makes directly aggregated ratings, which are commonly used to guide users’ choice by reflecting the overall quality of an item, incomparable across categories and hence prone to fairness and diversity issues. This paper aims to uncover and calibrate systematic category-wise biases for discrete-valued ratings. We propose a novel Bayesian multiplicative probit model that treats the inflation or deflation of mean rating for a combination of categories as multiplicatively contributed from category-specific parameters. The posterior distribution of those parameters, as inferred from data, can capture the bias for all possible combinations of categories, thus enabling statistically efficient estimation and principled rating calibration.</p>

    <h3>Recommending with an Agenda: Active Learning of Private Attributes using Matrix Factorization (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Smriti Bhagat, Nina Taft, Udi Weinsberg, Stratis Ioannidis</p>
    <p>Recommender systems leverage user demographic information, such as age, gender, etc., to personalize recommendations and better place their targeted ads. Oftentimes, users do not volunteer this information due to privacy concerns, or due to a lack of initiative in filling out their online profiles. We illustrate a new threat in which a recommender learns private attributes of users who do not voluntarily disclose them. We design both passive and active attacks that so- licit ratings for strategically selected items, and could thus be used by a recommender system to pursue this hidden agenda. Our methods are based on a novel usage of Bayesian matrix factorization in an active learning setting. Evaluations on multiple datasets illustrate that such attacks are indeed feasible and use significantly fewer rated items than static inference methods. Importantly, they succeed without sacrificing the quality of recommendations to users.</p>

    <h3>Recommending User Generated Item Lists (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min Xie, Yidan Liu, Laks V.S. Lakshmanan</p>
    <p>Existing recommender systems mostly focus on recommending individual items which users may be interested in. User-generated item lists on the other hand have become a popular feature in many applications. E.g., Goodreads provides users with an interface for creating and sharing interesting book lists. These user-generated item lists complement the main functionality of the corresponding application, and intuitively become an alternative way for users to browse and discover interesting items to be consumed. Unfortunately, existing recommender systems are not designed for recommending user-generated item lists. In this work, we study properties of these user-generated item lists and propose a Bayesian ranking model, called \LRM for recommending them. The proposed \LRM model takes into consideration users’ previous interactions with both item lists and with individual items. Furthermore, we propose in \LRM a novel way of weighting items within item lists based on both position of items, and personalized list consumption pattern. Through extensive experiments on real item list dataset from Goodreads, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed \LRM model.</p>

    <h3>Social Influence Bias in Recommender Systems: A Methodology for Learning, Analyzing, and Mitigating Bias in Ratings (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jay Patel, Sanjay Krishnan, Michael Franklin, Ken Goldberg</p>
    <p>To facilitate browsing and selection, almost all recommender systems display an aggregate statistic (the average/mean or median rating value) for each item. This value has potential to influence a participant’s individual rating for an item due to what is known in the survey and psychology literature as Social Influence Bias; the tendency for individuals to conform to what they perceive as the norm in a community. As a result, ratings can be closer to the average and less diverse than they would be otherwise. We propose a methodology to 1) learn, 2) analyze, and 3) mitigate the effect of social influence bias in recommender systems. In the Learning phase, a baseline dataset is established with an initial set of participants by allowing them to rate items twice: before seeing the median rating, and again after seeing it. In the Analysis phase, a new non-parametric significance test based on the Wilcoxon statistic can quantify the extent of social influence bias in this data. If this bias is significant, we propose a Mitigation phase where mathematical models are constructed from this data using polynomial regression and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and then inverted to produce a filter that can reduce the effect of social influence bias. As a case study, we apply this methodology to the California Report Card (CRC), a new recommender system that encourages political engagement. After the Learning phase collected 9390 ratings, the non-parametric test in the Analysis phase rejected the null hypothesis, identifying significant social influence bias: ratings after display of the median were on average 19.3% closer to the median value. In the Mitigating phase, the learned polynomial models were able to predict changed ratings with a normalized RMSE of 12.8% and reduce bias by 76.3%. Results suggest that social influence bias can be significant in recommender systems and that this bias can be substantially reduced with machine learning.</p>

    <h3>Question Recommendation for Collaborative Question Answering Systems with RankSLDA (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose San Pedro, Alexandros Karatzoglou</p>
    <p>Collaborative question answering (CQA) communities rely on user participation for their success. This paper presents a supervised Bayesian approach to model expertise in on-line CQA communities with application to question recommendation, aimed at reducing waiting times for responses and avoiding question starvation. We propose a novel algorithm called RankSLDA which extends the supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (sLDA) model by considering a learning-to-rank paradigm. This allows us to exploit the inherent collaborative effects that are present in CQA communities where users tend to answer questions in their topics of expertise. Users can thus be modeled on the basis of the topics in which they demonstrate expertise. In the supervised stage of the method we model the pairwise order of expertise of users on a given question. We compare RankSLDA against several alternative methods on data from the Cross Validate community, part of the Stack Exchange CQA network. RankSLDA outperforms all alternative methods by a significant margin.</p>
