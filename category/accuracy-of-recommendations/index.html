    <h3>Calibrating the Predictions for Top-N Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Sato</p>
    <p>Well-calibrated predictions of user preferences are essential for many applications. Since recommender systems typically select the top-N items for users, calibration for those top-N items, rather than for all items, is important.  We show that previous calibration methods result in miscalibrated predictions for the top-N items, despite their excellent calibration performance when evaluated on all items.  In this work, we address the miscalibration in the top-N recommended items. We first define evaluation metrics for this objective and then propose a generic method to optimize calibration models focusing on the top-N items. It groups the top-N items by their ranks and optimizes distinct calibration models for each group with rank-dependent training weights.  We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for both explicit and implicit feedback datasets, using diverse classes of recommender models.</p>

    <h3>Fewer Flops at the Top: Accuracy, Diversity, and Regularization in Two-Class Collaborative Filtering (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bibek Paudel, Thilo Haas, Abraham Bernstein</p>
    <p>In most existing recommender systems, implicit or explicit interactions are treated as positive links and all unknown interactions are treated as negative links. The goal is to suggest new links that will be perceived as positive links. However, as signed social networks and newer content services become common, it is important to distinguish between positive and negative preferences. Even in existing applications, the cost of a negative recommendation could be high when people are looking for new jobs, friends, or places to live. In this work, we develop novel probabilistic latent factor models to recommend positive links and compare with existing methods on five different openly available datasets. Our models are able to produce better ranking lists and are effective in the task of ranking positive links at the top and negative links at the bottom. Moreover, we find that modeling signed social networks and user preferences this way has the advantage of increasing diversity of recommendations. We also investigate the effect of regularization on the quality of recommendations, a matter that has not received enough attention in the literature. We find that regularization parameter heavily affects the quality of recommendations in terms of both accuracy and diversity.</p>

    <h3>SemRevRec: A Recommender System based on User Reviews and Linked Data (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Monti, Iacopo Vagliano, Maurizio Morisio</p>
    <p>Traditionally, recommender systems exploit user ratings to infer preferences. However, the growing popularity of social platforms has encouraged users to write textual reviews about liked items. These reviews represent a valuable source of non-trivial information that could improve usersâ€™ decision processes. In this paper we propose a novel recommendation approach based on the semantic annotation of entities mentioned in user reviews and on the knowledge available in the Web of Data. We compared our recommender system with two baseline algorithms and a state-of-the-art Linked Data based approach. Our system provided more diverse recommendations with respect to the other techniques considered, while obtaining a better accuracy than the Linked Data based method.</p>
