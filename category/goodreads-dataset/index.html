    <h3>LLM Based Generation of Item-Description for Recommendation System (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brijraj Singh, Naoyuki Onoe, Arkadeep Acharya</p>
    <p>The description of an item plays a pivotal role in providing concise and informative summaries to captivate potential viewers and is essential for recommendation systems. Traditionally, such descriptions were obtained through manual web scraping techniques, which are time-consuming and susceptible to data inconsistencies. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, and open source LLMs like Alpaca have emerged as powerful tools for natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we have explored how we can use LLMs to generate detailed descriptions of the items. To conduct the study, we have used the MovieLens 1M dataset comprising movie titles and the Goodreads Dataset consisting of names of books and subsequently, an open-sourced LLM, Alpaca, was prompted with few-shot prompting on this dataset to generate detailed movie descriptions considering multiple features like the names of the cast and directors for the ML dataset and the names of the author and publisher for the Goodreads dataset. The generated description was then compared with the scraped descriptions using a combination of Top Hits, MRR, and NDCG as evaluation metrics. The results demonstrated that LLM-based movie description generation exhibits significant promise, with results comparable to the ones obtained by web-scraped descriptions.</p>

    <h3>Recommending User Generated Item Lists (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min Xie, Yidan Liu, Laks V.S. Lakshmanan</p>
    <p>Existing recommender systems mostly focus on recommending individual items which users may be interested in. User-generated item lists on the other hand have become a popular feature in many applications. E.g., Goodreads provides users with an interface for creating and sharing interesting book lists. These user-generated item lists complement the main functionality of the corresponding application, and intuitively become an alternative way for users to browse and discover interesting items to be consumed. Unfortunately, existing recommender systems are not designed for recommending user-generated item lists. In this work, we study properties of these user-generated item lists and propose a Bayesian ranking model, called \LRM for recommending them. The proposed \LRM model takes into consideration usersâ€™ previous interactions with both item lists and with individual items. Furthermore, we propose in \LRM a novel way of weighting items within item lists based on both position of items, and personalized list consumption pattern. Through extensive experiments on real item list dataset from Goodreads, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed \LRM model.</p>
