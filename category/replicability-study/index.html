    <h3>Revisiting BPR: A Replicability Study of a Common Recommender System Baseline (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandr Milogradskii, Oleg Lashinin, Sergey Kolesnikov, Alexander P, Marina Ananyeva</p>
    <p>Bayesian Personalized Rank (BPR), a collaborative filtering approach based on matrix factorization, frequently serves as a benchmark for recommender systems research. However, numerous studies often overlook the nuances of BPR implementation, claiming that it performs worse than newly proposed methods across various tasks. In this paper, we thoroughly examine the features of the BPR model, indicating their impact on its performance, and investigate open-source BPR implementations. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies between these implementations and the original BPR paper, leading to a significant decrease in performance of up to 50% for specific implementations. Furthermore, through extensive experiments on real-world datasets under modern evaluation settings, we demonstrate that with proper tuning of its hyperparameters, the BPR model can achieve performance levels close to state-of-the-art methods on the top-n recommendation tasks and even outperform them on specific datasets. Specifically, on the Million Song Dataset, the BPR model with hyperparameters tuning statistically significantly outperforms Mult-VAE by 10% in NDCG@100 with binary relevance function.</p>

    <h3>A Systematic Review and Replicability Study of BERT4Rec for Sequential Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandr Petrov, Craig Macdonald</p>
    <p>BERT4Rec is an effective model for sequential recommendation based on the Transformer architecture. In the original publication, BERT4Rec claimed superiority over other available sequential recommendation approaches (e.g. SASRec), and it is now frequently being used as a state-of-the art baseline for sequential recommendation. However, not all subsequent publications confirmed its superiority and have proposed other models that were shown to outperform BERT4Rec in effectiveness. In this paper we systematically review all publications that compare BERT4Rec with another popular Transformer-based model, namely SASRec, and show that BERT4Rec results are not consistent within these publications. To understand the reasons behind this inconsistency, we analyse the available implementations of BERT4Rec and show that we fail to reproduce results of the original BERT4Rec publication when using their default configuration parameters. However, we are able to replicate the reported results with the original code if training for a much longer amount of time (up to 30x) compared to the default configuration. We also propose our own implementation of BERT4Rec based on the HuggingFace Transformers library, which we demonstrate replicates the originally reported results on 3 out 4 datasets, while requiring up to 95% less training time to converge. Overall, from our systematic review and detailed experiments, we conclude that BERT4Rec does indeed exhibit state-of-the-art effectiveness for sequential recommendation, but only when trained for a sufficient amount of time. Additionally, we show that our implementation can further benefit from adapting other Transformer architectures that are available in the HuggingFace Transformers library (e.g. using disentangled attention, as provided by DeBERTa, or larger hidden layer size cf. ALBERT). For example, on the MovieLens-1M dataset, we demonstrate that both these models can improve BERT4Rec performance by up to 9%. Moreover, we show that an ALBERT-based BERT4Rec model achieves better performance on that dataset than state-of-the-art results reported in the most recent publications.</p>
