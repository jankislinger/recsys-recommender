    <h3>Reproducibility Analysis of Recommender Systems relying on Visual Features: traps, pitfalls, and countermeasures (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elio Musacchio, Marco Polignano, Antonio Silletti, Pasquale Lops, Giovanni Semeraro, Cataldo Musto</p>
    <p>Reproducibility is an important requirement for scientific progress, and the lack of reproducibility for a large amount of published research can hinder the progress over the state-of-the-art. This concerns several research areas, and recommender systems are witnessing the same reproducibility crisis. Even solid works published at prestigious venues might not be reproducible for several reasons: data might not be public, source code for recommendation algorithms might not be available or well documented, and evaluation metrics might be computed using parameters not explicitly provided. In addition, recommendation pipelines are becoming increasingly complex due to the use of deep neural architectures or representations for multimodal side information involving text, images, audio, or video. This makes the reproducibility of experiments even more challenging. In this work, we describe an extension of an already existing open-source recommendation framework, called ClayRS, with the aim of providing the foundation for future reproducibility of recommendation processes involving images as side information. This extension, called ClayRS Can See, is the starting point for reproducing state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms exploiting images. We have provided our implementation of one of these algorithms, namely VBPR â€“ Visual Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback, and we have discussed all the issues related to the reproducibility of the study to deeply understand the main traps and pitfalls, along with solutions to deal with such complex environments. We conclude the work by proposing a checklist for recommender systems reproducibility as a guide for the research community.</p>

    <h3>Audio-Visual Encoding of Multimedia Content to Enhance Movie Recommendations (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Schedl, Bogdan Ionescu, Paolo Cremonesi, Yashar Deldjoo, Mihai Gabriel Constantin, Hamid Eghbal-zadeh</p>
    <p>We propose a multi-modal content-based movie recommender system that replaces human-generated metadata by content descriptions automatically extracted from the visual and audio channels of a video. Content descriptors improve over traditional metadata in terms of both richness (it is possible to extract hundreds of meaningful features covering various modalities) and quality (content features are consistent across different systems and immune to human errors). Our recommender system integrates state-of-the-art aesthetic and deep visual features as well as block-level and i-vector audio features. For fusing the different modalities, we propose a rank aggregation strategy extending the Borda count approach. We evaluate the proposed multi-modal recommender system comprehensively against metadata-based baselines. To this end, we conduct two empirical studies: (i) a system-centric study to measure the offline quality of recommendations in terms of accuracy-related and beyond-accuracy performance measures (novelty, diversity, and coverage), and (ii) a user-centric online experiment, measuring different subjective metrics, including relevance, satisfaction, and diversity. In both studies, we use a dataset of more than 4,000 movie trailers, which makes our approach versatile. Our results shed light on the accuracy and beyond-accuracy performance of audio, visual, and textual features in content-based movie recommender systems.</p>
