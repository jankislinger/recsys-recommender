    <h3>Towards Open-World Recommendation with Knowledge Augmentation from Large Language Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiwen Liu, Bo Chen, Yong Yu, Hong Zhu, Yunjia Xi, Weinan Zhang, Jianghao Lin, Xiaoling Cai, Jieming Zhu, Ruiming Tang</p>
    <p>Recommender system plays a vital role in various online services. However, its insulated nature of training and deploying separately within a specific closed domain limits its access to open-world knowledge. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in bridging this gap by encoding extensive world knowledge and demonstrating reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, previous attempts to directly use LLMs as recommenders cannot meet the inference latency demand of industrial recommender systems. In this work, we propose an Open-World Knowledge Augmented Recommendation Framework with Large Language Models, dubbed KAR, to acquire two types of external knowledge from LLMs — the reasoning knowledge on user preferences and the factual knowledge on items. We introduce factorization prompting to elicit accurate reasoning on user preferences. The generated reasoning and factual knowledge are effectively transformed and condensed into augmented vectors by a hybrid-expert adaptor in order to be compatible with the recommendation task. The obtained vectors can then be directly used to enhance the performance of any recommendation model. We also ensure efficient inference by preprocessing and prestoring the knowledge from the LLM. Extensive experiments show that KAR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and is compatible with a wide range of recommendation algorithms. We deploy KAR to Huawei’s news and music recommendation platforms and gain a 7% and 1.7% improvement in the online A/B test, respectively.</p>

    <h3>A Unified Graph Transformer for Overcoming Isolations in Multi-modal Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixuan Yi, Iadh Ounis</p>
    <p>With the rapid development of online multimedia services, especially in e-commerce platforms, there is a pressing need for personalised recommendation systems that can effectively encode the diverse multi-modal content associated with each item. However, we argue that existing multi-modal recommender systems typically use isolated processes for both feature extraction and modality modelling. Such isolated processes can harm the recommendation performance. Firstly, an isolated extraction process underestimates the importance of effective feature extraction in multi-modal recommendations, potentially incorporating non-relevant information, which is harmful to item representations. Second, an isolated modality modelling process produces disjointed embeddings for item modalities due to the individual processing of each modality, which leads to a suboptimal fusion of user/item representations for effective user preferences prediction. We hypothesise that the use of a unified model for addressing both aforementioned isolated processes will enable the consistent extraction and cohesive fusion of joint multi-modal features, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of multi-modal recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called Unified Multi-modal Graph Transformer (UGT), which firstly leverages a multi-way transformer to extract aligned multi-modal features from raw data for top-k recommendation. Subsequently, we build a unified graph neural network in our UGT model to jointly fuse the user/item representations with their corresponding multi-modal features. Using the graph transformer architecture of our UGT model, we show that the UGT model can achieve significant effectiveness gains, especially when jointly optimised with the commonly-used multi-modal recommendation losses. Our extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed UGT model over seven existing state-of-the-art recommendation approaches.</p>

    <h3>Task Aware Feature Extraction Framework for Sequential Dependence Multi-Task Learning (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Cheng, Wenfang Lin, Xuewen Tao, Mingming Ha, Qiongxu Ma, Xiaobo Guo</p>
    <p>In online recommendation, financial service, etc., the most common application of multi-task learning (MTL) is the multi-step conversion estimations. A core property of the multi-step conversion is the sequential dependence among tasks. Most existing works focus far more on the specific post-view click-through rate (CTR) and post-click conversion rate (CVR) estimations, which neglect the generalization of sequential dependence multi-task learning (SDMTL). Besides, the performance of the SDMTL framework is also deteriorated by the interference derived from implicitly conflict information passing between adjacent tasks. In this paper, a systematic learning paradigm of the SDMTL problem is established for the first time, which can transform the SDMTL problem into a general MTL problem and be applicable to more general multi-step conversion scenarios with longer conversion path or stronger task dependence. Also, the distribution dependence between adjacent task spaces is illustrated from a theoretical point of view. On the other hand, an SDMTL architecture, named Task Aware Feature Extraction (TAFE), is developed to enable dynamic task representation learning from a sample-wise view. TAFE selectively reconstructs the implicit shared information corresponding to each sample case and performs explicit task-specific extraction under dependence constraints. Extensive experiments on offline public and real-world industrial datasets, and online A/B implementations demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of proposed theoretical and implementation frameworks.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Negative Preference in Content-based Music Recommendation with Contrastive Learning (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minju Park, Kyogu Lee</p>
    <p>Advanced music recommendation systems are being introduced along with the development of machine learning. However, it is essential to design a music recommendation system that can increase user satisfaction by understanding users’ music tastes, not by the complexity of models. Although several studies related to music recommendation systems exploiting negative preferences have shown performance improvements, there was a lack of explanation on how they led to better recommendations. In this work, we analyze the role of negative preference in users’ music tastes by comparing music recommendation models with contrastive learning exploiting preference (CLEP) but with three different training strategies - exploiting preferences of both positive and negative (CLEP-PN), positive only (CLEP-P), and negative only (CLEP-N). We evaluate the effectiveness of the negative preference by validating each system with a small amount of personalized data obtained via survey and further illuminate the possibility of exploiting negative preference in music recommendations. Our experimental results show that CLEP-N outperforms the other two in accuracy and false positive rate. Furthermore, the proposed training strategies produced a consistent tendency regardless of different types of front-end musical feature extractors, proving the stability of the proposed method.</p>

    <h3>An Ontology-based Knowledgebase for User Profile and Garment Features in Apparel Recommender Systems (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bolanle Olufisayo Dahunsi</p>
    <p>This research proposes the development of an ontology-based knowledgebase for Apparel recommender systems. User and garment attribute definitions and expert style rules will be extracted from expert literature and the most important accuracy-driving user and garment features will be parsed from it. The features will then be used to define the classes and slots of the knowledgebase with constraints defined by the style rules from the experts. This knowledgebase will be made publicly available for modification and reuse in future apparel recommender systems design.</p>

    <h3>Neural Gaussian Mixture Model for Review-based Rating Prediction (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haofei Zhou, Jian Yu, Dong Deng, Liping Jing, Sun Shaolong</p>
    <p>Reviews has been proven to be an important information in recommendation. Different from the overall user-item rating matrix, it can provide textual information that exhibits why a user likes an item or not. Recently, more and more researchers have paid attention on review-based rating prediction. There are two challenging issues: how to extract representative features to characterize users / items from reviews and how to leverage them for recommendation system. In this paper, we propose a Neural Gaussian Mixture Model for review-based rating prediction task (NGMM). Among it, the textual review information is used to construct two parallel neural networks for users and items respectively, so that the users’ preferences and items’ properties can be sufficiently extracted and written as two latent vectors. A shared layer is introduced on the top to couple these two networks together and model user-item rating based on the features learned from reviews. Specifically, each rating is modeled via a Gaussian mixture model, where each Gaussian component has zero variance, the mean described by the corresponding component in user’s latent vector and the weight indicated by the corresponding component in item’s latent vector. Extensive experiments are conducted on five real-world Amazon review datasets. The experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed NGMM model achieves the state-of-the-art performance in review-based rating prediction task.</p>

    <h3>Aesthetic Features for Personalized Photo Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Putra Manggala, Ga Wu, Yu Qing Zhou, Scott Sanner</p>
    <p>Many photography websites such as Flickr, 500px, Unsplash, and Adobe Behance are used by amateur and professional photography enthusiasts. Unlike content-based image search, such users of photography websites are not just looking for photos with certain content, but more generally for photos with a certain photographic “aesthetic”. In this context, we explore personalized photo recommendation and propose two aesthetic feature extraction methods based on (i) color space and (ii) deep style transfer embeddings. Using a dataset from 500px, we evaluate how these features can be best leveraged by collaborative filtering methods and show that (ii) provides a significant boost in photo recommendation performance.</p>

    <h3>Content-based Feature Exploration for Transparent Music Recommendation using Self-attentive Genre Classification (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juheon Lee, Kyogu Lee, Seungjin Lee</p>
    <p>Interpretation of retrieved results is an important issue in music recommender systems, particularly from a user perspective. In this study, we investigate the methods for providing interpretability of content features using self-attention. We extract lyric features with the self-attentive genre classification model trained on 140,000 tracks of lyrics. Likewise, we extract acoustic features using the acoustic model with self-attention trained on 120,000 tracks of acoustic signals. The experimental results show that the proposed methods provide the characteristics that are interpretable in terms of both lyrical and musical contents. We demonstrate this by visualizing the attention weights, and by presenting the most similar songs found using lyric or audio features.</p>

    <h3>A Multi-criteria Recommender System Exploiting Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis of Users’ Reviews (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco De Gemmis, Giovanni Semeraro, Cataldo Musto, Pasquale Lops</p>
    <p>In this paper we propose a multi-criteria recommender system based on collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, which exploits the information conveyed by users’ reviews to provide a multi-faceted representation of users’ interests. To this end, we exploited a framework for opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which automatically extracts relevant aspects and sentiment scores from users’ reviews. As an example, in a restaurant recommendation scenario, the aspects may regard food quality, service, position, atmosphere of the place and so on. Such a multi-faceted representation of the user is used to feed a multi-criteria CF algorithm which predicts user interest in a particular item and provides her with recommendations. In the experimental session we evaluated the performance of the algorithm against several state-of-the-art baselines; Results confirmed the insight behind this work, since our approach was able to overcome both single-criteria recommendation algorithms as well as more sophisticated techniques based on matrix factorization.</p>

    <h3>Interpretable Convolutional Neural Networks with Dual Local and Global Attention for Review Rating Prediction (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing Huang, Sungyong Seo, Hao Yang, Yan Liu</p>
    <p>Recently, many e-commerce websites have encouraged their users to rate shopping items and write review text. This review text information has been very useful for understanding user preferences and item properties and it enhances the capability to make personalized recommendations of these websites. In this paper, we propose to model user preferences and item properties using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with dual local and global attention, motivated by the superiority of CNNs to extract complex features. By using aggregated review text from a user and aggregated review text for an item, our model can learn the unique features (embedding) of each user and each item. These features are then used to predict ratings. We train these user and item networks jointly and this enables the interaction between users and items in a similar way to matrix factorization. The local attention gives us insight on a user’s preferences or an item’s properties. The global attention helps CNNs focus on semantic meanings of the whole review text. Thus, the combined local and global attentions enable an interpretable and better-learned representation of users and items. We validate the proposed models by applying popular review datasets in Yelp and Amazon and compare the results with matrix factorization (MF), the hidden factors as topics (HFT) model, and the recently proposed convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF+). The proposed CNNs with dual attention model outperforms HFT and ConvMF+ in terms of mean square errors (MSE). In addition, we compare the user/item embeddings learned from these models for classification and recommendation. These results also confirm the superior quality of user/item embeddings learned from our model.</p>

    <p>We introduce HRS, a recommender that exploits user reviews and identifies the features that are most likely appealing to users. HRS incorporates this knowledge into the recommendation process to generate a list of top-k recommendations, each of which is paired with an explanation that (i) showcases why a particular item was recommended and (ii) helps users decide which items, among the ones  recommended,  are  best  tailored  towards  their  individual interests.

    <h3>Aspect-Based Opinion Mining and Recommendation System for Restaurant Reviews (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Magdalini Eirinaki, Syeda Roohi, Vaishak Suresh</p>
    <p>The success of a product/service in e-commerce largely depends on the user reviews. A product/service that has a higher average review or rating usually gets picked against a similar product/service with less favorable reviews. Reviews usually have an overall rating, but most of the times there are sub-texts in the review body that describe certain features/aspects of the product. This demonstration presents a system that extracts aspect-specific ratings from reviews and also recommends reviews to users based on their and other users' rating patterns.</p>
