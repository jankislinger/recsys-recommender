    <h3>Modeling User Repeat Consumption Behavior for Online Novel Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cunxiang Yin, Leeven Luo, Yuncong Li, Yancheng He, Guoqiang Xu, Jing Cai, Sheng-hua Zhong</p>
    <p>Given a user’s historical interaction sequence, online novel recommendation suggests the next novel the user may be interested in. Online novel recommendation is important but underexplored. In this paper, we concentrate on recommending online novels to new users of an online novel reading platform, whose first visits to the platform occurred in the last seven days. We have two observations about online novel recommendation for new users. First, repeat novel consumption of new users is a common phenomenon. Second, interactions between users and novels are informative. To accurately predict whether a user will reconsume a novel, it is crucial to characterize each interaction at a fine-grained level. Based on these two observations, we propose a neural network for online novel recommendation, called NovelNet. NovelNet can recommend the next novel from both the user’s consumed novels and new novels simultaneously. Specifically, an interaction encoder is used to obtain accurate interaction representation considering fine-grained attributes of interaction, and a pointer network with a pointwise loss is incorporated into NovelNet to recommend previously-consumed novels. Moreover, an online novel recommendation dataset is built from a well-known online novel reading platform and is released for public use as a benchmark. Experimental results on the dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of NovelNet 1.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation on Live-Streaming Platforms: Dynamic Availability and Repeat Consumption (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karl Aberer, Jeremie Rappaz, Julian McAuley</p>
    <p>Live-streaming platforms broadcast user-generated video in real-time. Recommendation on these platforms shares similarities with traditional settings, such as a large volume of heterogeneous content and highly skewed interaction distributions. However, several challenges must be overcome to adapt recommendation algorithms to live-streaming platforms: first, content availability is dynamic which restricts users to choose from only a subset of items at any given time; during training and inference we must carefully handle this factor in order to properly account for such signals, where ‘non-interactions’ reflect availability as much as implicit preference. Streamers are also fundamentally different from ‘items’ in traditional settings: repeat consumption of specific channels plays a significant role, though the content itself is fundamentally ephemeral. In this work, we study recommendation in this setting of a dynamically evolving set of available items. We propose LiveRec, a self-attentive model that personalizes item ranking based on both historical interactions and current availability. We also show that carefully modelling repeat consumption plays a significant role in model performance. To validate our approach, and to inspire further research on this setting, we release a dataset containing 475M user interactions on Twitch over a 43-day period. We evaluate our approach on a recommendation task and show our method to outperform various strong baselines in ranking the currently available content.</p>

    <h3>Explainable Recommendation for Repeat Consumption (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masataka Goto, Kosetsu Tsukuda</p>
    <p>Displaying appropriate explanations for recommended items is of vital importance for improving the persuasiveness and user satisfaction of recommender systems. Although a user often consumes the same item repeatedly in some domains such as music and restaurants, existing studies have focused on generating explanations for recommending novel items. In this paper, we describe the concept of explainable recommendation for repeatedly consumed items. Because of the high proportion of repeat consumption in music listening, we suggest nine kinds of explanations for song recommendations according to three factors: personal, social, and item factors. From the results of an online survey involving 622 participants, we evaluate the usefulness of these explanations.</p>
