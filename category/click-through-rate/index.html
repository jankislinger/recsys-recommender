    <h3>MCM: A Multi-task Pre-trained Customer Model for Personalization (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianxin Wang, Peng Wan, Rui Luo, Jingyuan Deng</p>
    <p>Personalization plays a critical role in helping customers discover the products and contents they prefer for e-commerce stores.Personalized recommendations differ in contents, target customers, and UI. However, they require a common core capability – the ability to deeply understand customers’ preferences and shopping intents. In this paper, we introduce the MLCM (Multi-task Large pre-trained Customer Model), a large pre-trained BERT-based multi-task customer model with 10 million trainable parameters for e-commerce stores. This model aims to empower all personalization projects by providing commonly used preference scores for recommendations, customer embeddings for transfer learning, and a pre-trained model for fine-tuning. In this work, we improve the SOTA BERT4Rec framework to handle heterogeneous customer signals and multi-task training as well as innovate new data augmentation method that is suitable for recommendation task. Experimental results show that MLCM outperforms the original BERT4Rec by 17% on preference prediction tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that the model can be easily fine-tuned to assist a specific recommendation task. For instance, after fine-tuning MLCM for an incentive based recommendation project, performance improves by 60% on the conversion prediction task and 25% on the click-through prediction task compared to the production baseline model.</p>

    <h3>Creating the next generation of news experience on ekstrabladet.dk with recommender systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Riis Andersen, Jes Frellsen, Johannes Kruse, Kasper Lindskow</p>
    <p>With the uptake of algorithmic personalization, news organizations have to increasingly trust automated systems with previously considered editorial values, e.g., prioritizing news to readers. In the case study carried out by Ekstra Bladet, the Platform Intelligent News project demonstrates how recommender systems successfully enhanced the click-through rates (CTR) for multiple segments at ekstrabladet.dk while still prioritizing the news organization’s editorial values.</p>

    <h3>Power Loss Function in Neural Networks for Predicting Click-Through Rate (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ergun Biçici</p>
    <p>Loss functions guide machine learning models towards concentrating on the error most important to improve upon.  We introduce power loss functions for neural networks and apply them on imbalanced click-through rate datasets. Power loss functions decrease the loss for confident predictions and increase the loss for error-prone predictions. They improve both AUC and F1 and produce better calibrated results.  We obtain improvements in the results on four different classifiers and on two different datasets. We obtain significant improvements in AUC that reach $0.44\%$ for DeepFM on the Avazu dataset.</p>

    <h3>Page-level Optimization of e-Commerce Item Recommendations (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Justin M Platz, Kathy Hu, Hongliang Yu, Krutika Shetty, Chieh Lo, Adam Ilardi, Xin Yin, Sriganesh Madhvanath, Changchen He</p>
    <p>The item details page (IDP) is a web page on an e-commerce website that provides information on a specific product or item listing. Just below the details of the item on this page, the buyer can usually find recommendations for other relevant items. These are typically in the form of a series of modules or carousels, with each module containing a set of recommended items. The selection and ordering of these item recommendation modules are intended to increase discover-ability of relevant items and encourage greater user engagement, while simultaneously showcasing diversity of inventory and satisfying other business objectives. Item recommendation modules on the IDP are often curated and statically configured for all customers, ignoring opportunities for personalization. In this paper, we present a scalable end-to-end production system to optimize the personalized selection and ordering of item recommendation modules on the IDP in real-time by utilizing deep neural networks. Through extensive offline experimentation and online A/B testing, we show that our proposed system achieves significantly higher click-through and conversion rates compared to other existing methods. In our online A/B test, our framework improved click-through rate by 2.48% and purchase-through rate by 7.34% over a static configuration.</p>

    <h3>Adaptive, Personalized Diversity for Visual Discovery (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijai Mohan, Mitchell Goodman, Choon Hui Teo, S. V. N. Vishwanathan, Daniel Hill, Houssam Nassif, Sriram Srinivasan</p>
    <p>Search queries are appropriate when users have explicit intent, but they perform poorly when the intent is difficult to express or if the user is simply looking to be inspired. Visual browsing systems allow e-commerce platforms to address these scenarios while offering the user an engaging shopping experience. Here we explore extensions in the direction of adaptive personalization and item diversification within Stream, a new form of visual browsing and discovery by Amazon. Our system presents the user with a diverse set of interesting items while adapting to user interactions. Our solution consists of three components (1) a Bayesian regression model for scoring the relevance of items while leveraging uncertainty, (2) a submodular diversification framework that re-ranks the top scoring items based on category, and (3) personalized category preferences learned from the user’s behavior. When tested on live traffic, our algorithms show a strong lift in click-through-rate and session duration.</p>

    <h3>Offline and Online Evaluation of News Recommender Systems at swissinfo.ch (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Donatsch, Amr Huber, Florent Garcin, Boi Faltings, Ayar Alazzawi, Christophe Bruttin</p>
    <p>We report on the live evaluation of various news recommender systems conducted on the website swissinfo.ch. We demonstrate that there is a major difference between offline and online accuracy evaluations. In an offline setting, recommending most popular stories is the best strategy, while in a live environment this strategy is the poorest. For online setting, context-tree recommender systems which profile the users in real-time improve the click-through rate by up to 35%. The visit length also increases by a factor of 2.5. Our experience holds important lessons for the evaluation of recommender systems with offline data as well as for the use of the click-through rate as a performance indicator.</p>
