    <h3>User-Centric Evaluation of Session-Based Recommendations for an Automated Radio Station (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dietmar Jannach, Malte Ludewig</p>
    <p>The creation of an automated and virtually endless playlist given a start item is a common feature of modern media streaming services. When no past information about the user’s preferences is available, the creation of such playlists can be done using session-based recommendation techniques. In this case, the recommendations only depend on the start item and the user’s interactions in the current listening session, such as ‘liking’ or skipping an item. In recent years, various novel session-based techniques were proposed, often based on deep learning. The evaluation of such approaches is in most cases solely based on offline experimentation and abstract accuracy measures. However, such evaluations cannot inform us about the quality as perceived by users. To close this research gap, we have conducted a user study (N=250), where the participants interacted with an automated online radio station. Each treatment group received recommendations that were generated by one of five different algorithms. Our results show that comparably simple techniques led to quality perceptions that are similar or even better than when a complex deep learning mechanism or Spotify’s recommendations are used. The simple mechanisms, however, often tend to recommend comparably popular tracks, which can lead to lower discovery effects. i>Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Folding: Why Good Models Sometimes Make Spurious Recommendations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Mayoraz, Karthik Lakshmanan, John R. Anderson, Hubert Pham, Doris Xin</p>
    <p>In recommender systems based on low rank factorization of a partially observed user-item matrix, a common phenomenon that plagues many otherwise effective models is the interleaving of good and spurious recommendations in the top-K results. A single incongruous recommendation can dramatically impact the perceived quality of a recommender system. In this work, we investigate folding, a major contributing factor to spurious recommendations. Folding refers to the unintentional overlap of disparate groups of users and items in the low-rank embedding vector space, induced by improper handling of missing data. We formally define a metric that quantifies the severity of folding in a trained system, to assist in diagnosing its potential to shock users with inappropriate recommendations. The folding metric complements existing information retrieval metrics that focus on the number of good recommendations and their ranks but ignore the impact of undesired recommendations. We motivate our definition of the folding metric on synthetic data and evaluate its effectiveness on both synthetic and real world datasets. We study the relationship between the folding metric and other characteristics of recommender systems and observe that optimizing for goodness metrics can lead to high folding and thus more spurious recommendations.</p>
