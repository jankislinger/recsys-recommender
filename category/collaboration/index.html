    <h3>Learning to Collaborate in Multi-Module Recommendation via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning without Communication (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haikai Chen, Bo An, Rundong Wang, Xu He, Yanghua Li, Runsheng Yu, Zhirong Wang, Xin Li, Xinrun Wang</p>
    <p>With the rise of online e-commerce platforms, more and more customers prefer to shop online. To sell more products, online platforms introduce various modules to recommend items with different properties such as huge discounts. A web page often consists of different independent modules. The ranking policies of these modules are decided by different teams and optimized individually without cooperation, which might result in competition between modules. Thus, the global policy of the whole page could be sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent cooperative reinforcement learning approach with the restriction that different modules cannot communicate. Our contributions are three-fold. Firstly, inspired by a solution concept in game theory named correlated equilibrium, we design a signal network to promote cooperation of all modules by generating signals (vectors) for different modules. Secondly, an entropy-regularized version of the signal network is proposed to coordinate agents’ exploration of the optimal global policy. Furthermore, experiments based on real-world e-commerce data demonstrate that our algorithm obtains superior performance over baselines.</p>

    <h3>Recommendations for Chemists: A Case Study (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Douglas Bacon, Steven L. Rohall, Bill Shirley, Margaret Pancost-Heidebrecht, Michael A. Tarselli</p>
    <p>Large pharmaceutical companies have a wealth of reaction and chemical structure data, but face a new problem: analyzing that corpus to yield project insights and future directions. One straightforward approach would be to have a recommendation system to match drug structures with similar research endeavors across geographically- or organizationally-separated groups. We developed and deployed Chem Recommender, a system that suggests similar, related work to experiments that chemists have recently started. The goal of the system is to accelerate the drug discovery process by ensuring that chemists are aware of each other’s work. To date, we have sent more than 8500 recommendations to over 800 medicinal chemists in our organization. The results have been positive, with several chemists reporting that the recommendations have aided their molecular syntheses.</p>

    <h3>Educational Question Routing in Online Student Communities (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Srba, Jakub Macina, Joseph Jay Williams, Maria Bielikova</p>
    <p>Students’ performance in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is enhanced by high quality discussion forums or recently emerging educational Community Question Answering (CQA) systems. Nevertheless, only a small number of students answer questions asked by their peers. This results in instructor overload, and many unanswered questions. To increase students’ participation, we present an approach for recommendation of new questions to students who are likely to provide answers. Existing approaches to such question routing proposed for non-educational CQA systems tend to rely on a few experts, which is not suitable because we want students to be engaged as it positively influences their learning outcomes. In tackling this novel educational question routing problem, our method (1) goes beyond previous question-answering data as it incorporate additional non-QA data from the course (to improve prediction accuracy and to involve a larger part of community) and (2) applies constraints on users’ workload (to prevent user overloading). We use an ensemble classifier for predicting students’ willingness to answer a question, as well as the students’ expertise for answering. We conducted an online evaluation of the proposed method using an A/B test in our CQA system deployed at an edX MOOC. The proposed method outperformed a baseline method (non-educational question routing enhanced with workload restriction) in recommendation accuracy, involving more community members, and average number of contributions.</p>
