    <h3>Touch the Core: Exploring Task Dependence Among Hybrid Targets for Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiuqiang He, Xing Tang, Dugang Liu, Yang Qiao, Fuyuan Lyu</p>
    <p>As user behaviors become complicated on business platforms, online recommendations focus more on how to touch the core conversions, which are highly related to the interests of platforms. These core conversions are usually continuous targets, such as watch time, revenue, and so on, whose predictions can be enhanced by previous discrete conversion actions. Therefore, multi-task learning (MTL) can be adopted as the paradigm to learn these hybrid targets. However, existing works mainly emphasize investigating the sequential dependence among discrete conversion actions, which neglects the complexity of dependence between discrete conversions and the final continuous conversion. Moreover, simultaneously optimizing hybrid tasks with stronger task dependence will suffer from volatile issues where the core regression task might have a larger influence on other tasks. In this paper, we study the MTL problem with hybrid targets for the first time and propose the model named Hybrid Targets Learning Network (HTLNet) to explore task dependence and enhance optimization. Specifically, we introduce label embedding for each task to explicitly transfer the label information among these tasks, which can effectively explore logical task dependence. We also further design the gradient adjustment regime between the final regression task and other classification tasks to enhance the optimization. Extensive experiments on two offline public datasets and one real-world industrial dataset are conducted to validate the effectiveness of HTLNet. Moreover, online A/B tests on the financial recommender system also show our model has superior improvement.</p>

    <h3>Progressive Layered Extraction (PLE): A Novel Multi-Task Learning (MTL) Model for Personalized Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming Zhao, Hongyan Tang, Junning Liu, Xudong Gong</p>
    <p>Multi-task learning (MTL) has been successfully applied to many recommendation applications. However, MTL models often suffer from performance degeneration with negative transfer due to the complex and competing task correlation in real-world recommender systems. Moreover, through extensive experiments across SOTA MTL models, we have observed an interesting seesaw phenomenon that performance of one task is often improved by hurting the performance of some other tasks. To address these issues, we propose a Progressive Layered Extraction (PLE) model with a novel sharing structure design. PLE separates shared components and task-specific components explicitly and adopts a progressive routing mechanism to extract and separate deeper semantic knowledge gradually, improving efficiency of joint representation learning and information routing across tasks in a general setup. We apply PLE to both complicatedly correlated and normally correlated tasks, ranging from two-task cases to multi-task cases on a real-world Tencent video recommendation dataset with 1 billion samples, and results show that PLE outperforms state-of-the-art MTL models significantly under different task correlations and task-group size. Furthermore, online evaluation of PLE on a large-scale content recommendation platform at Tencent manifests 2.23% increase in view-count and 1.84% increase in watch time compared to SOTA MTL models, which is a significant improvement and demonstrates the effectiveness of PLE. Finally, extensive offline experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that PLE can be applied to a variety of scenarios besides recommendations to eliminate the seesaw phenomenon. PLE now has been deployed to the online video recommender system in Tencent successfully.</p>
