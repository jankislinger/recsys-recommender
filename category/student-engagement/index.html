    <h3>Towards a Recommender System for Undergraduate Research (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Del Rio, Denis Parra, Erick Svec, Jovan Kuzmicic</p>
    <p>Several studies indicate that attracting students to research careers requires to engage them from early undergraduate years. Following this, the Engineering School at PUC Chile has developed an undergraduate research program that allows students to enroll in research in exchange for course credits. Moreover, we developed a web portal to inform students about the program, but participation remains lower than expected. In order to promote student engagement, we attempt to build a personalized recommender system of research opportunities to undergraduates. With this goal in mind we investigate two tasks. First, identifying students that are more willing to participate on this kind of program. A second task is generating a personalized list of recommendations of research opportunities for each student. To evaluate our approach, we perform a simulated prediction experiment with data from our school, which has more than 4,000 active undergraduate students nowadays. Results indicate that there is a big potential to create a personalized recommender system for this purpose. Our research can be used as a baseline for colleges seeking strategies to encourage research activities within undergraduate students.</p>

    <h3>Educational Question Routing in Online Student Communities (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Srba, Jakub Macina, Joseph Jay Williams, Maria Bielikova</p>
    <p>Students’ performance in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is enhanced by high quality discussion forums or recently emerging educational Community Question Answering (CQA) systems. Nevertheless, only a small number of students answer questions asked by their peers. This results in instructor overload, and many unanswered questions. To increase students’ participation, we present an approach for recommendation of new questions to students who are likely to provide answers. Existing approaches to such question routing proposed for non-educational CQA systems tend to rely on a few experts, which is not suitable because we want students to be engaged as it positively influences their learning outcomes. In tackling this novel educational question routing problem, our method (1) goes beyond previous question-answering data as it incorporate additional non-QA data from the course (to improve prediction accuracy and to involve a larger part of community) and (2) applies constraints on users’ workload (to prevent user overloading). We use an ensemble classifier for predicting students’ willingness to answer a question, as well as the students’ expertise for answering. We conducted an online evaluation of the proposed method using an A/B test in our CQA system deployed at an edX MOOC. The proposed method outperformed a baseline method (non-educational question routing enhanced with workload restriction) in recommendation accuracy, involving more community members, and average number of contributions.</p>

    <h3>Automating Readers’ Advisory to Make Book Recommendations for K-12 Readers (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Pera, Yiu-Kai Ng</p>
    <p>The academic performance of students is affected by their reading ability, which explains why reading is one of the most important aspects of school curriculums. Promot- ing good reading habits among K-12 students is essential, given the enormous influence of reading on students’ de- velopment as learners and members of society. In doing so, it is indispensable to provide readers with engaging and motivating reading selections. Unfortunately, existing book recommenders have failed to offer adequate choices for K- 12 readers, since they either ignore the reading abilities of their users or cannot acquire the much-needed information to make recommendations due to privacy issues. To address these problems, we have developed Rabbit, a book recom- mender that emulates the readers’ advisory service offered at school/public libraries. Rabbit considers the readability levels of its readers and determines the facets, i.e., appeal factors, of books that evoke subconscious, emotional reac- tions on a reader. The design of Rabbit is unique, since it adopts a multi-dimensional approach to capture the reading abilities, preferences, and interests of its readers, which goes beyond the traditional book content/topical analysis. Con- ducted empirical studies have shown that Rabbit outper- forms a number of (readability-based) book recommenders.</p>
