    <h3>Right Tool, Right Job: Recommendation for Repeat and Exploration Consumption in Food Delivery (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayu Li, Aixin Sun, Min Zhang, Weizhi Ma, Peijie Sun</p>
    <p>From e-commerce to music and news, recommender systems are tailored to specific scenarios. While researching generic models applicable to various scenarios is crucial, studying recommendations based on the unique characteristics of a specific and vital scenario holds both research and, more importantly, practical value. In this paper, we focus on store recommendations in the food delivery scenario, which is an intriguing and significant domain with unique behavior patterns and influential factors. First, we offer an in-depth analysis of real-world food delivery data across platforms and countries, revealing that (i) repeat and exploration orders are both noticeable behaviors and (ii) the influences of historical and collaborative situations on repeat and exploration consumption are distinct. Second, based on the observations, we separately design two simple yet effective recommendation models: <i>RepRec</i> for repeat orders and <i>ExpRec</i> for exploration ones. An ensemble module is further proposed to combine recommendations from two models for a unified recommendation list. Finally, experiments are conducted on three datasets spanning three countries across two food delivery platforms. Results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed recommenders on repeat, exploration, and combined recommendation tasks over various baselines. Such simple yet effective approaches will be beneficial for real applications. This work shows that dedicated analyses and methods for domain-specific characteristics are essential for the recommender system studies.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Performance Estimates for Augmenting Recommendation Ensembles (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrygo L. T. Santos, Gustavo Penha</p>
    <p>Ensembling multiple recommender systems via stacking has shown to be effective at improving collaborative recommendation. Recent work extends stacking to use additional user performance predictors (e.g., the total number of ratings made by the user) to help determine how much each base recommender should contribute to the ensemble. Nonetheless, despite the cost of handcrafting discriminative predictors, which typically requires deep knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of each recommender in the ensemble, only minor improvements have been observed. To overcome this limitation, instead of engineering complex features to predict the performance of different recommenders for a given user, we propose to directly estimate these performances by leveraging the user’s own historical ratings. Experiments on real-world datasets from multiple domains demonstrate that using performance estimates as additional features can significantly improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art ensemblers, achieving nDCG@20 improvements by an average of 23% over not using them.</p>

    <h3>Multi-Armed Recommender System Bandit Ensembles (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcos Redondo, Rocío Cañamares, Pablo Castells</p>
    <p>It has long been found that well-configured recommender system ensembles can achieve better effectiveness than the combined systems separately. Sophisticated approaches have been developed to automatically optimize the ensembles’ configuration to maximize their performance gains. However most work in this area has targeted simplified scenarios where algorithms are tested and compared on a single non-interactive run. In this paper we consider a more realistic perspective bearing in mind the cyclic nature of the recommendation task, where a large part of the system’s input is collected from the reaction of users to the recommendations they are delivered. The cyclic process provides the opportunity for ensembles to observe and learn about the effectiveness of the combined algorithms, and improve the ensemble configuration progressively. In this paper we explore the adaptation of a multi-armed bandit approach to achieve this, by representing the combined systems as arms, and the ensemble as a bandit that at each step selects an arm to produce the next round of recommendations. We report experiments showing the effectiveness of this approach compared to ensembles that lack the iterative perspective. Along the way, we find illustrative pitfall examples that can result from common, single-shot offline evaluation setups. i>Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Efficient Online Recommendation via Low-Rank Ensemble Sampling (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Wen, Branislav Kveton, Xiuyuan Lu</p>
    <p>The low-rank structure is one of the most prominent features in modern recommendation problems. In this paper, we consider an online learning problem with a low-rank expected reward matrix where both row features and column features are unknown a priori, and the agent aims to learn to choose the best row-column pair (i.e. the maximum entry) in the matrix. We develop a novel online recommendation algorithm based on ensemble sampling, a recently developed computationally efficient approximation of Thompson sampling. Our computational results show that our algorithm consistently achieves order-of-magnitude improvements over the baselines in both synthetic and real-world experiments.</p>

    <h3>Case Recommender: A Flexible and Extensible Python Framework for Recommender Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcelo Manzato, Fernando Soares De Aguiar Neto, Arthur Fortes Da Costa, Eduardo Pereira Fressato, Ricardo José Gabrielli Barreto Campello</p>
    <p>This paper presents a polished open-source Python-based recommender framework named Case Recommender, which provides a rich set of components from which developers can construct and evaluate customized recommender systems. It implements well-known and state-of-the-art algorithms in rating prediction and item recommendation scenarios. The main advantage of the Case Recommender is the possibility to integrate clustering and ensemble algorithms with recommendation engines, easing the development of more accurate and efficient approaches.</p>

    <h3>Educational Question Routing in Online Student Communities (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Srba, Jakub Macina, Joseph Jay Williams, Maria Bielikova</p>
    <p>Students’ performance in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is enhanced by high quality discussion forums or recently emerging educational Community Question Answering (CQA) systems. Nevertheless, only a small number of students answer questions asked by their peers. This results in instructor overload, and many unanswered questions. To increase students’ participation, we present an approach for recommendation of new questions to students who are likely to provide answers. Existing approaches to such question routing proposed for non-educational CQA systems tend to rely on a few experts, which is not suitable because we want students to be engaged as it positively influences their learning outcomes. In tackling this novel educational question routing problem, our method (1) goes beyond previous question-answering data as it incorporate additional non-QA data from the course (to improve prediction accuracy and to involve a larger part of community) and (2) applies constraints on users’ workload (to prevent user overloading). We use an ensemble classifier for predicting students’ willingness to answer a question, as well as the students’ expertise for answering. We conducted an online evaluation of the proposed method using an A/B test in our CQA system deployed at an edX MOOC. The proposed method outperformed a baseline method (non-educational question routing enhanced with workload restriction) in recommendation accuracy, involving more community members, and average number of contributions.</p>

    <h3>Ensemble Contextual Bandits for Personalized Recommendation (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Li, Lei Li, Yexi Jiang, Liang Tang</p>
    <p>The cold-start problem has attracted extensive attention among various online services that provide personalized recommendation. Many online vendors employ contextual bandit strategies to tackle the so-called exploration/exploitation dilemma rooted from the cold-start problem. However, due to high-dimensional user/item features and the underlying characteristics of bandit policies, it is often difficult for service providers to obtain and deploy an appropriate algorithm to achieve acceptable and robust economic profit. In this paper, we explore ensemble strategies of multiple contextual bandit algorithms to obtain robust predicted click-through rate (CTR) of web objects. Specifically, the ensemble is acquired by aggregating different pulling policies of bandit algorithms, rather than forcing the agreement of prediction results or learning a unified predictive model. To this end, we employ a meta-bandit paradigm that places a hyper bandit over the base bandits, to explicitly explore/exploit the relative importance of base bandits based on user feedbacks. Extensive empirical experiments on two real-world data sets (news recommendation and online advertising) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of CTR.</p>
