    <h3>Towards Health-Aware Fairness in Food Recipe Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehrdad Rostami, Mourad Oussalah, Mohammad Aliannejadi</p>
    <p>Food recommendation systems play a crucial role in suggesting personalized recommendations designed to help users find food and recipes that align with their preferences. However, many existing food recommendation systems have overlooked the important aspect of considering the health and nutritional value of recommended foods, thereby limiting their effectiveness in generating truly healthy recommendations. Our preliminary analysis indicates that users tend to respond positively to unhealthy food and recipes. As a result, existing food recommender systems that neglect health considerations often assign high scores to popular items, inadvertently encouraging unhealthy choices among users. In this study, we propose the development of a fairness-based model that prioritizes health considerations. Our model incorporates fairness constraints from both the user and item perspectives, integrating them into a joint objective framework. Experimental results conducted on real-world food datasets demonstrate that the proposed system not only maintains the ability of food recommendation systems to suggest users’ favorite foods but also improves the health factor compared to unfair models, with an average enhancement of approximately 35%.</p>

    <h3>Leveraging Large Language Models for Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Panos Louridas, Dietmar Jannach, Marios Fragkoulis, Wouter Zorgdrager, Jesse Harte, Asterios Katsifodimos</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation problems have received increasing attention in research during the past few years, leading to the inception of a large variety of algorithmic approaches. In this work, we explore how large language models (LLMs), which are nowadays introducing disruptive effects in many AI-based applications, can be used to build or improve sequential recommendation approaches. Specifically, we devise and evaluate three approaches to leverage the power of LLMs in different ways. Our results from experiments on two datasets show that initializing the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation model BERT4Rec with embeddings obtained from an LLM improves NDCG by 15-20% compared to the vanilla BERT4Rec model. Furthermore, we find that a simple approach that leverages LLM embeddings for producing recommendations, can provide competitive performance by highlighting semantically related items. We publicly share the code and data of our experiments to ensure reproducibility.</p>

    <h3>Stability of Explainable Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sairamvinay Vijayaraghavan, Prasant Mohapatra</p>
    <p>Explainable Recommendation has been gaining attention over the last few years in industry and academia. Explanations provided along with recommendations for each user in a recommender system framework have many uses: particularly reasoning why a suggestion is provided and how well an item aligns with a user’s personalized preferences. Hence, explanations can play a huge role in influencing users to purchase products. However, the reliability of the explanations under varying scenarios has not been strictly verified in an empirical perspective. Unreliable explanations can bear strong consequences such as attackers leveraging explanations for manipulating and tempting users to purchase target items: that the attackers would want to promote. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of existent feature-oriented explainable recommenders, particularly analyzing their performance under different levels of external noises added into model parameters. We conducted experiments by analyzing three important state-of-the-art explainable recommenders when trained on two widely used e-commerce based recommendation datasets of different scales. We observe that all the explainable models are vulnerable to increased noise levels. Experimental results verify our hypothesis that the ability to explain recommendations does decrease along with increasing noise levels and particularly adversarial noise does contribute to a much stronger decrease. Our study presents an empirical verification on the topic of robust explanations in recommender systems which can be extended to different types of explainable recommenders in RS.</p>

    <h3>Exploring the Value of Personality in Predicting Rating Behaviors: A Study of Category Preferences on MovieLens (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph A. Konstan, Raghav Pavan Karumur, Tien T. Nguyen</p>
    <p>Prior work relevant to incorporating personality into recommender systems falls into two categories: social science studies and algorithmic ones. Social science studies of preference have found only small relationships between personality and category preferences, whereas, algorithmic approaches found a little improvement when incorporating personality into recommendations. As a result, despite good reasons to believe personality assessments should be useful in recommenders, we are left with no substantial demonstrated impact. In this work, we start with user data from a live recommender system, but study category-by-category variations in preference (both rating levels and distribution) across different personality types. By doing this, we hope to isolate specific areas where personality is most likely to provide value in recommender systems, while also modeling an analytic process that can be used in other domains. After controlling for the family-wise error rate, we find that High Agreeableness users rate at least 0.5 stars higher on a 5-star scale compared to low Agreeableness users. We also find differences in consumption in four different personality types between people who manifested high and low levels of that personality.</p>
