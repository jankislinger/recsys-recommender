    <h3>The MovieLens Beliefs Dataset: Collecting Pre-Choice Data for Online Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guy Aridor, Duarte Goncalves, Daniel Kluver, Ruoyan Kong, Joseph Konstan</p>
    <p>An increasingly important aspect of designing recommender systems involves considering how recommendations will influence consumer choices. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a method for collecting user beliefs about un-experienced items – a critical predictor of choice behavior. We implemented this method on the MovieLens platform, resulting in a rich dataset that combines user ratings, beliefs, and observed recommendations. We document challenges to such data collection, including selection bias in response and limited coverage of the product space. This unique resource empowers researchers to delve deeper into user behavior and analyze user choices absent recommendations, measure the effectiveness of recommendations, and prototype algorithms that leverage user belief data, ultimately leading to more impactful recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>Intent-Aware Diversification Using a Constrained PLSA (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacek Wasilewski, Neil Hurley</p>
    <p>The intent-aware diversification framework was introduced initially in information retrieval and adopted to the context of recommender systems in the work of Vargas et al. The framework considers a set of aspects associated with items to be recommended. For instance, aspects may correspond to genres in movie recommendations. The framework depends on input aspect model consisting of item selection or relevance probabilities, given an aspect, and user intents, in the form of probabilities that the user is interested in each aspect. In this paper, we examine a number of input aspect models and evaluate the impact that different models have on the framework. In particular, we propose a constrained PLSA model that allows for interpretable output, in terms of known aspects, while achieving greater performance that the explicit co-occurrence counting method used in previous work. We evaluate the proposed models using a well-known MovieLens dataset for which item genres are available.</p>

    <h3>Gaze Prediction for Recommender Systems (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qian Zhao, F. Maxwell Harper, Shuo Chang, Joseph A. Konstan</p>
    <p>As users browse a recommender system, they systematically consider or skip over much of the displayed content. It seems obvious that these eye gaze patterns contain a rich signal concerning these users’ preferences. However, because eye tracking data is not available to most recommender systems, these signals are not widely incorporated into personalization models. In this work, we show that it is possible to predict gaze by combining easily-collected user browsing data with eye tracking data from a small number of users in a grid-based recommender interface. Our technique is able to leverage a small amount of eye tracking data to infer gaze patterns for other users. We evaluate our prediction models in MovieLens — an online movie recommender system. Our results show that incorporating eye tracking data from a small number of users significantly boosts accuracy as compared with only using browsing data, even though the eye-tracked users are different from the testing users (e.g. AUC=0.823 vs. 0.693 in predicting whether a user will fixate on an item). We also demonstrate that Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) can be applied in this setting; they are better than linear models in predicting fixation probability and capturing the interface regularity through Bayesian inference (AUC=0.823 vs. 0.757).</p>

    <h3>Exploring the Value of Personality in Predicting Rating Behaviors: A Study of Category Preferences on MovieLens (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph A. Konstan, Raghav Pavan Karumur, Tien T. Nguyen</p>
    <p>Prior work relevant to incorporating personality into recommender systems falls into two categories: social science studies and algorithmic ones. Social science studies of preference have found only small relationships between personality and category preferences, whereas, algorithmic approaches found a little improvement when incorporating personality into recommendations. As a result, despite good reasons to believe personality assessments should be useful in recommenders, we are left with no substantial demonstrated impact. In this work, we start with user data from a live recommender system, but study category-by-category variations in preference (both rating levels and distribution) across different personality types. By doing this, we hope to isolate specific areas where personality is most likely to provide value in recommender systems, while also modeling an analytic process that can be used in other domains. After controlling for the family-wise error rate, we find that High Agreeableness users rate at least 0.5 stars higher on a 5-star scale compared to low Agreeableness users. We also find differences in consumption in four different personality types between people who manifested high and low levels of that personality.</p>
