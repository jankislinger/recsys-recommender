    <h3>Enhancing Recommendation Quality of the SASRec Model by Mitigating Popularity Bias (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xenija Neufeld, Sebastian Loth, Andreas Gr√ºn, Venkata Harshit Koneru</p>
    <p>ZDF is a Public Service Media (PSM) broadcaster in Germany that uses recommender systems on its streaming service platform ZDFmediathek. One of the main use cases within the ZDFmediathek is Next Video, which is currently based on a Self-Attention based Sequential Recommendation model (SASRec). For this use case, we modified the loss function, the sampling method of negative items, and introduced the top-k negative sampling strategy and compared this to the vanilla SASRec model. We show that this not only reduces popularity bias, but also increases clicks and the viewing volume compared to that of the vanilla version.</p>

    <h3>Turning Dross Into Gold Loss: is BERT4Rec really better than SASRec? (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexey Vasilev, Anton Klenitskiy</p>
    <p>Recently sequential recommendations and next-item prediction task has become increasingly popular in the field of recommender systems. Currently, two state-of-the-art baselines are Transformer-based models SASRec and BERT4Rec. Over the past few years, there have been quite a few publications comparing these two algorithms and proposing new state-of-the-art models. In most of the publications, BERT4Rec achieves better performance than SASRec. But BERT4Rec uses cross-entropy over softmax for all items, while SASRec uses negative sampling and calculates binary cross-entropy loss for one positive and one negative item. In our work, we show that if both models are trained with the same loss, which is used by BERT4Rec, then SASRec will significantly outperform BERT4Rec both in terms of quality and training speed. In addition, we show that SASRec could be effectively trained with negative sampling and still outperform BERT4Rec, but the number of negative examples should be much larger than one.</p>

    <h3>A Systematic Review and Replicability Study of BERT4Rec for Sequential Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandr Petrov, Craig Macdonald</p>
    <p>BERT4Rec is an effective model for sequential recommendation based on the Transformer architecture. In the original publication, BERT4Rec claimed superiority over other available sequential recommendation approaches (e.g. SASRec), and it is now frequently being used as a state-of-the art baseline for sequential recommendation. However, not all subsequent publications confirmed its superiority and have proposed other models that were shown to outperform BERT4Rec in effectiveness. In this paper we systematically review all publications that compare BERT4Rec with another popular Transformer-based model, namely SASRec, and show that BERT4Rec results are not consistent within these publications. To understand the reasons behind this inconsistency, we analyse the available implementations of BERT4Rec and show that we fail to reproduce results of the original BERT4Rec publication when using their default configuration parameters. However, we are able to replicate the reported results with the original code if training for a much longer amount of time (up to 30x) compared to the default configuration. We also propose our own implementation of BERT4Rec based on the HuggingFace Transformers library, which we demonstrate replicates the originally reported results on 3 out 4 datasets, while requiring up to 95% less training time to converge. Overall, from our systematic review and detailed experiments, we conclude that BERT4Rec does indeed exhibit state-of-the-art effectiveness for sequential recommendation, but only when trained for a sufficient amount of time. Additionally, we show that our implementation can further benefit from adapting other Transformer architectures that are available in the HuggingFace Transformers library (e.g. using disentangled attention, as provided by DeBERTa, or larger hidden layer size cf. ALBERT). For example, on the MovieLens-1M dataset, we demonstrate that both these models can improve BERT4Rec performance by up to 9%. Moreover, we show that an ALBERT-based BERT4Rec model achieves better performance on that dataset than state-of-the-art results reported in the most recent publications.</p>
