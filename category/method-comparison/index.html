    <h3>One-class Matrix Factorization: Point-Wise Regression-Based or Pair-Wise Ranking-Based? (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Wei Chen, Chih-Jen Lin</p>
    <p>One-class matrix factorization (MF) is an important technique for recommender systems with implicit feedback. In one widely used setting, a regression function is fit in a point-wise manner on observed and some unobserved (user, item) entries. Recently, in AAAI 2019, Chen et al. [2] proposed a pair-wise ranking-based approach for observed (user, item) entries to be compared against unobserved ones. They concluded that the pair-wise setting performs consistently better than the more traditional point-wise setting. However, after some detailed investigation, we explain by mathematical derivations that their method may perform only similar to the point-wise ones. We also identified some problems when reproducing their experimental results. After considering suitable settings, we rigorously compare point-wise and pair-wise one-class MFs, and show that the pair-wise method is actually not better. Therefore, for one-class MF, the more traditional and mature point-wise setting should still be considered. Our findings contradict the conclusions in [2] and serve as a call for caution when researchers are comparing between two machine learning methods.</p>

    <h3>Streaming Session-Based Recommendation: When Graph Neural Networks meet the Neighborhood (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sara Latifi, Dietmar Jannach</p>
    <p>Frequent updates and model retraining are important in various application areas of recommender systems, e.g., news recommendation. Moreover, in such domains, we may not only face the problem of dealing with a constant stream of new data, but also with anonymous users, leading to the problem of streaming session-based recommendation (SSR). Such problem settings have attracted increased interest in recent years, and different deep learning architectures were proposed that support fast updates of the underlying prediction models when new data arrive. In a recent paper, a method based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) was proposed as being superior than previous methods for the SSR problem. The baselines in the reported experiments included different machine learning models. However, several earlier studies have shown that often conceptually simpler methods, e.g., based on nearest neighbors, can be highly effective for session-based recommendation problems. In this work, we report a similar phenomenon for the streaming configuration. We first reproduce the results of the mentioned GNN method and then show that simpler methods are able to outperform this complex state-of-the-art neural method on two datasets. Overall, our work points to continued methodological issues in the academic community, e.g., in terms of the choice of baselines and reproducibility.1</p>

    <h3>An Interpretable Recommendation Model for Gerontological Care (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paula Castro, Andre Paulino de Lima, Maria Pimentel, Brunela Orlandi, Laurentino Augusto Dantas, Marcelo Garcia Manzato</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have been successfully applied to diverse areas, but their use in the healthcare domain is still rare. One challenge of applying recommender systems to this domain is related to legal concerns about the consequences of provided recommendations. In this work, we advance an expert-in-the-loop, explanation-first approach to tackle this challenge in a specific healthcare niche: gerontological care. A key aspect of the proposed approach is that both recommendations and explanations reflect the structured questionnaire employed by the practitioner to identify patient needs. Another key aspect is that a clinical dataset of patient assessments and respective assigned interventions is used to estimate effects of alternative interventions during the recommendation process. To evaluate the feasibility of this modelling approach, an explanation style was designed with help of practitioners, and a recommendation model was devised and evaluated against a clinical dataset, which was collected by a partner research group working on gerontological primary care. When compared to other traditional recommendation models, the attained precision was competitive across several evaluation conditions. The results suggest that the proposed approach is feasible and may point new ways of adapting recommender systems to play an assistive role in health care.</p>

    <h3>A Deep Learning System for Predicting Size and Fit in Fashion E-Commerce (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Urs Bergmann, Yuen King Ho, Reza Shirvany, Romain Guigourès, Evgenii Koriagin, Abdul-Saboor Sheikh, Roland Vollgraf</p>
    <p>Personalized size and fit recommendations bear crucial significance for any fashion e-commerce platform. Predicting the correct fit drives customer satisfaction and benefits the business by reducing costs incurred due to size-related returns. Traditional collaborative filtering algorithms seek to model customer preferences based on their previous orders. A typical challenge for such methods stems from extreme sparsity of customer-article orders. To alleviate this problem, we propose a deep learning based content-collaborative methodology for personalized size and fit recommendation. Our proposed method can ingest arbitrary customer and article data and can model multiple individuals or intents behind a single account. The method optimizes a global set of parameters to learn population-level abstractions of size and fit relevant information from observed customer-article interactions. It further employs customer and article specific embedding variables to learn their properties. Together with learned entity embeddings, the method maps additional customer and article attributes into a latent space to derive personalized recommendations. Application of our method to two publicly available datasets demonstrate an improvement over the state-of-the-art published results. On two proprietary datasets, one containing fit feedback from fashion experts and the other involving customer purchases, we further outperform comparable methodologies, including a recent Bayesian approach for size recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Geographical Diversification in POI Recommendation: Toward Improved Coverage on Interested Areas (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jungkyu Han, Hayato Yamana</p>
    <p>In recommending POIs, the accuracy is important. However, merely accurate recommendations are useless in real life. Thus, beyond accuracy – such as the diversity of the recommended POIs – is as important as accuracy for a good recommendation. Although existing diversification methods can help POI recommender systems recommend more diverse POIs, they lack “geographical diversification” that results in concentration of “diverse” recommended POIs on “a small portion” of the most active areas of the target-user. This is caused by the neglect of POI locations in the diversification i.e., existing diversification methods try to diversify the categories of recommended items (POIs). However, geographical diversification is indispensable for the user whose activity district consists of many sub-areas and who requires variety of recommended POIs over his/her activity sub-areas. In this paper, we propose a novel proportional geographical diversification method to recommend variety of POIs located in his/her activity district but variety of sub-areas in the district proportional to the frequency of his/her activity to each sub-area. We compared our proposed method with existing diversification methods with real datasets. The evaluation result shows that no methods except for our proposed method can significantly increase geographical diversity at the expense of tolerable accuracy loss.</p>

    <h3>Educational Question Routing in Online Student Communities (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Srba, Jakub Macina, Joseph Jay Williams, Maria Bielikova</p>
    <p>Students’ performance in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is enhanced by high quality discussion forums or recently emerging educational Community Question Answering (CQA) systems. Nevertheless, only a small number of students answer questions asked by their peers. This results in instructor overload, and many unanswered questions. To increase students’ participation, we present an approach for recommendation of new questions to students who are likely to provide answers. Existing approaches to such question routing proposed for non-educational CQA systems tend to rely on a few experts, which is not suitable because we want students to be engaged as it positively influences their learning outcomes. In tackling this novel educational question routing problem, our method (1) goes beyond previous question-answering data as it incorporate additional non-QA data from the course (to improve prediction accuracy and to involve a larger part of community) and (2) applies constraints on users’ workload (to prevent user overloading). We use an ensemble classifier for predicting students’ willingness to answer a question, as well as the students’ expertise for answering. We conducted an online evaluation of the proposed method using an A/B test in our CQA system deployed at an edX MOOC. The proposed method outperformed a baseline method (non-educational question routing enhanced with workload restriction) in recommendation accuracy, involving more community members, and average number of contributions.</p>
