    <h3>Evaluating the Pros and Cons of Recommender Systems Explanations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kathrin Wardatzky</p>
    <p>Despite the growing interest in explainable AI in the RecSys community, the evaluation of explanations is still an open research topic. Typically, explanations are evaluated using offline metrics, with a case study, or through a user study. In my research, I will have a closer look at the evaluation of the effects of explanations on users. I investigate two possible factors that can impact the effects reported in recent publications, namely the explanation design and content as well as the users themselves. I further address the problem of determining promising explanations for an application scenario from a seemingly endless pool of options. Lastly, I propose a user study to close some of the research gaps established in the surveys and investigate how recommender systems explanations impact the understanding of users with different backgrounds.</p>

    <h3>Explainability in Music Recommender System (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahrzad Shashaani</p>
    <p>Recommendation systems play a crucial role in our daily lives, influencing many of our significant and minor decisions. These systems also have become integral to the music industry, guiding users to discover new content based on their tastes. However, the lack of transparency in these systems often leaves users questioning the rationale behind recommendations. To address this issue, adding transparency and explainability to recommender systems is a promising solution. Enhancing the explainability of these systems can significantly improve user trust and satisfaction. This research focuses on exploring transparency and explainability in the context of recommendation systems, focusing on the music domain. This research can help to understand the gaps in explainability in music recommender systems to create more engaging and trustworthy music recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Creating the next generation of news experience on ekstrabladet.dk with recommender systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Riis Andersen, Jes Frellsen, Johannes Kruse, Kasper Lindskow</p>
    <p>With the uptake of algorithmic personalization, news organizations have to increasingly trust automated systems with previously considered editorial values, e.g., prioritizing news to readers. In the case study carried out by Ekstra Bladet, the Platform Intelligent News project demonstrates how recommender systems successfully enhanced the click-through rates (CTR) for multiple segments at ekstrabladet.dk while still prioritizing the news organization’s editorial values.</p>

    <h3>How Should We Measure Filter Bubbles? A Regression Model and Evidence for Online News (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Verachtert, Jens Leysen, Annelien Smets, Jorre Vannieuwenhuyze, Lien Michiels, Bart Goethals</p>
    <p>News media play an important role in democratic societies.  Central to fulfilling this role is the premise that users should be exposed to diverse news.  However, news recommender systems are gaining popularity on news websites, which has sparked concerns over filter bubbles. Editors, policy-makers and scholars are worried that news recommender systems may expose users to less diverse content over time.  To the best of our knowledge, this hypothesis has not been tested in a longitudinal observational study of real users that interact with a real news website. Such observational studies require the use of research methods that are robust and can account for the many covariates that may influence the diversity of recommendations at any given time. In this work, we propose an analysis model to study whether the variety of articles recommended to a user decreases over time, in observational studies of real news websites with real users. Further, we present results from two case studies using aggregated and anonymized data that were collected by two western European news websites employing a collaborative filtering-based news recommender system to serve (personalized) recommendations to their users. Through these case studies we validate empirically that our modeling assumptions are sound and supported by the data, and that our model obtains more reliable and interpretable results than analysis methods used in prior empirical work on filter bubbles. Our case studies provide evidence of a small decrease in the topic variety of a user’s recommendations in the first weeks after they sign up, but no evidence of a decrease in political variety.</p>

    <h3>Personalised Recommendations for the BBC iPlayer: Initial approach and current challenges (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Polina Proutskova, Benjamin R. Clark, Duncan M. Walker, Kristine Grivcova</p>
    <p>BBC iPlayer is one of the most important digital products of the BBC, offering live and on-demand television for audiences in the UK with over 10 million weekly active users. The BBC’s role as a public service broadcaster, broadcasting over traditional linear channels as well as online presents a number of challenges for a recommender system. In addition to having substantially different objectives to a commercial service, we show that the diverse content offered by the BBC including news and sport, factual, drama and live events lead to a catalogue with a diversity of consumption patterns, depending on genre. Our research shows that simple models represent strong baselines in this system. We discuss our initial attempts to improve upon these baselines, and conclude with our current challenges.</p>

    <h3>LightSAGE: Graph Neural Networks for Large Scale Item Retrieval in Shopee’s Advertisement Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Zeng, Chenfei Wang, Yan Shen, Dang Minh Nguyen</p>
    <p>Graph Neural Network (GNN) is the trending solution for item retrieval in recommendation problems. Most recent reports, however, focus heavily on new model architectures. This may bring some gaps when applying GNN in the industrial setup, where, besides the model, constructing graph and handling data sparsity also play critical roles in the overall success of the project. In this work, we report how we apply GNN for large-scale e-commerce item retrieval at Shopee. We detail our simple yet novel and impactful techniques in graph construction, modeling, and handling data skewness. Specifically, we construct high-quality item graphs by combining strong-signal user behaviors with high-precision collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm. We then develop a new GNN architecture named LightSAGE to produce high-quality items’ embeddings for vector search. Finally, we develop multiple strategies to handle cold-start and long-tail items, which are critical in an advertisement (ads) system. Our models bring improvement in offline evaluations, online A/B tests, and are deployed to the main traffic of Shopee’s Recommendation Advertisement system.</p>

    <h3>A Multi-Stakeholder Recommender System for Rewards Recommendations (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Leontjeva, Thireindar Min, Luiz Pizzato, Naime Ranjbar Kermany, Callum Scott</p>
    <p>Australia’s largest bank, Commonwealth Bank (CBA) has a large data and analytics function that focuses on building a brighter future for all using data and decision science. In this work, we focus on creating better services for CBA customers by developing a next generation recommender system that brings the most relevant merchant reward offers that can help customers save money. Our recommender provides CBA cardholders with cashback offers from merchants, who have different objectives when they create offers. This work describes a multi-stakeholder, multi-objective problem in the context of CommBank Rewards (CBR) and describes how we developed a system that balances the objectives of the bank, its customers, and the many objectives from merchants into a single recommender system.</p>

    <h3>Top-K Contextual Bandits with Equity of Exposure (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Jeunen, Bart Goethals</p>
    <p>The contextual bandit paradigm provides a general framework for decision-making under uncertainty. It is theoretically well-defined and well-studied, and many personalisation use-cases can be cast as a bandit learning problem. Because this allows for the direct optimisation of utility metrics that rely on online interventions (such as click-through-rate (CTR)), this framework has become an attractive choice to practitioners. Historically, the literature on this topic has focused on a one-sided, user-focused notion of utility, overall disregarding the perspective of content providers in online marketplaces (for example, musical artists on streaming services). If not properly taken into account – recommendation systems in such environments are known to lead to unfair distributions of attention and exposure, which can directly affect the income of the providers. Recent work has shed a light on this, and there is now a growing consensus that some notion of “equity of exposure” might be preferable to implement in many recommendation use-cases.<br>We study how the top-K contextual bandit problem relates to issues of disparate exposure, and how this disparity can be minimised. The predominant approach in practice is to greedily rank the top-K items according to their estimated utility, as this is optimal according to the well-known Probability Ranking Principle. Instead, we introduce a configurable tolerance parameter that defines an acceptable decrease in utility for a maximal increase in fairness of exposure. We propose a personalised exposure-aware arm selection algorithm that handles this relevance-fairness trade-off on a user-level, as recent work suggests that users’ openness to randomisation may vary greatly over the global populace. Our model-agnostic algorithm deals with arm selection instead of utility modelling, and can therefore be implemented on top of any existing bandit system with minimal changes. We conclude with a case study on carousel personalisation in music recommendation: empirical observations highlight the effectiveness of our proposed method and show that exposure disparity can be significantly reduced with a negligible impact on user utility.</p>

    <h3>From the Lab to Production: A Case Study of Session-Based Recommendations in the Home-Improvement Domain (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pigi Kouki, Xiquan Cui, Khalifeh Al Jadda, Ilias Fountalis, Edo Liberty, Nikolaos Vasiloglou</p>
    <p>E-commerce applications rely heavily on session-based recommendation algorithms to improve the shopping experience of their customers. Recent progress in session-based recommendation algorithms shows great promise. However, translating that promise to real-world outcomes is a challenging task for several reasons, but mostly due to the large number and varying characteristics of the available models. In this paper, we discuss the approach and lessons learned from the process of identifying and deploying a successful session-based recommendation algorithm for a leading e-commerce application in the home-improvement domain. To this end, we initially evaluate fourteen session-based recommendation algorithms in an offline setting using eight different popular evaluation metrics on three datasets. The results indicate that offline evaluation does not provide enough insight to make an informed decision since there is no clear winning method on all metrics. Additionally, we observe that standard offline evaluation metrics fall short for this application. Specifically, they reward an algorithm only when it predicts the exact same item that the user clicked next or eventually purchased. In a practical scenario, however, there are near-identical products which, although they are assigned different identifiers, they should be considered as equally-good recommendations. To overcome these limitations, we perform an additional round of evaluation, where human experts provide both objective and subjective feedback for the recommendations of five algorithms that performed the best in the offline evaluation. We find that the experts’ opinion is oftentimes different from the offline evaluation results. Analysis of the feedback confirms that the performance of all models is significantly higher when we evaluate near-identical product recommendations as relevant. Finally, we run an A/B test with one of the models that performed the best in the human evaluation phase. The treatment model increased conversion rate by 15.6% and revenue per visit by 18.5% when compared with a leading third-party solution.</p>

    <h3>Recommendations for Chemists: A Case Study (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Douglas Bacon, Steven L. Rohall, Bill Shirley, Margaret Pancost-Heidebrecht, Michael A. Tarselli</p>
    <p>Large pharmaceutical companies have a wealth of reaction and chemical structure data, but face a new problem: analyzing that corpus to yield project insights and future directions. One straightforward approach would be to have a recommendation system to match drug structures with similar research endeavors across geographically- or organizationally-separated groups. We developed and deployed Chem Recommender, a system that suggests similar, related work to experiments that chemists have recently started. The goal of the system is to accelerate the drug discovery process by ensuring that chemists are aware of each other’s work. To date, we have sent more than 8500 recommendations to over 800 medicinal chemists in our organization. The results have been positive, with several chemists reporting that the recommendations have aided their molecular syntheses.</p>

    <h3>Computer Security Training Recommender for Developers (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward Allen, Muhammad Nadeem, Byron Williams</p>
    <p>Vulnerable code may cause security breaches in software systems resulting in loss of confidential data and financial losses for the organizations. Software developers must be given proper training to write secure code. Conventional training methods do not take the code written by the developers over time into account, which makes these training sessions less effective. We propose a Computer Security Training Recommender to help identify focused and narrow areas in which developers need training. The proposed recommender system leverages the power of static analysis techniques to suggest the most appropriate training topics for different software developers; moreover it utilizes public vulnerability repositories to suggest community accepted solutions to different security problems. This paper presents an architecture of the proposed recommender system and a proof-of-concept case study. We found that vulnerabilities, flagged in source code by static analysis tools, can be mapped to relevant articles in a vulnerability repository. Hence, the mitigation strategies given in such articles may be used as a resource to train individual software developers. Preliminary empirical evaluation shows that the proposed system is promising.</p>
