    <h3>Information Interactions in Outcome Prediction: Quantification and Interpretation using Stochastic Block Models (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaël Poux-Médard, Sabine Loudcher, Julien Velcin</p>
    <p>In most real-world applications, it is seldom the case that a result appears independently from an environment. In social networks, users’ behavior results from the people they interact with, news in their feed, or trending topics. In natural language, the meaning of phrases emerges from the combination of words. In general medicine, a diagnosis is established on the basis of the interaction of symptoms. Here, we propose the Interacting Mixed Membership Stochastic Block Model (IMMSBM), which investigates the role of interactions between entities (hashtags, words, memes, etc.) and quantifies their importance within the aforementioned corpora. We find that in inference tasks, taking them into account leads to average relative changes with respect to non-interacting models of up to 150% in the probability of an outcome and greatly improves the predictions performances. Furthermore, their role greatly improves the predictive power of the model. Our findings suggest that neglecting interactions when modeling real-world phenomena might lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn.</p>

    <h3>Compositional Network Embedding for Link Prediction (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Jiang, Wenwu Ou, Tianshu Lyu, Fei Sun, Yan Zhang</p>
    <p>Network embedding has proved extremely useful in a variety of network analysis tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and network visualization. Almost all the existing network embedding methods learn to map the node IDs to their corresponding node embeddings. This design principle, however, hinders the existing methods from being applied in real cases. Node ID is not generalizable and, thus, the existing methods have to pay great effort in cold-start problem. The heterogeneous network usually requires extra work to encode node types, as node type is not able to be identified by node ID. Node ID carries rare information, resulting in the criticism that the existing methods are not robust to noise. To address this issue, we introduce Compositional Network Embedding, a general inductive network representation learning framework that generates node embeddings by combining node features based on the ‘principle of compositionally’. Instead of directly optimizing an embedding lookup based on arbitrary node IDs, we learn a composition function that infers node embeddings by combining the corresponding node attribute embeddings through a graph-based loss. For evaluation, we conduct the experiments on link prediction under four different settings. The results verified the effectiveness and generalization ability of compositional network embeddings, especially on unseen nodes. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>EXTRA: Explaining Team Recommendation in Networks (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nan Cao, Qinghai Zhou, Hanghang Tong, Norbou Buchler, Liangyue Li</p>
    <p>State-of-the-art in network science of teams offers effective recommendation methods to answer questions like who is the best replacement, what is the best team expansion strategy, but lacks intuitive ways to explain why the optimization algorithm gives the specific recommendation for a given team optimization scenario. To tackle this problem, we develop an interactive prototype system, Extra, as the first step towards addressing such a sense-making challenge, through the lens of the underlying network where teams embed, to explain the team recommendation results. The main advantages are (1) Algorithm efficacy: we propose an effective and fast algorithm to explain random walk graph kernel, the central technique for networked team recommendation; (2) Intuitive visual explanation: we present intuitive visual analysis of the recommendation results, which can help users better understand the rationality of the underlying team recommendation algorithm.</p>

    <h3>Chemical Reactant Recommendation using a Network of Organic Chemistry (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ernesto Diaz-Aviles, Carlos Alzate, Akihiro Kishimoto, John Savage, Beat Buesser</p>
    <p>This paper presents recommendation algorithms for novel applications in chemistry. We focus on the task of recommending to the chemist candidate molecules (reactants) necessary to synthesize a given target molecule (product), which is an important step for the chemist to find a synthesis route to generate the product. We formulate this task as a link-prediction problem over a so-called Network of Organic Chemistry (NOC) that we have constructed from 8 million chemical reactions described in the US patent literature between 1976 and 2013. We leverage state-of-the-art factorization algorithms for recommender systems to solve this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Factorization Machines, trained with chemistry-specific knowledge, outperforms current methods based on similarity of chemical structures.</p>

    <h3>Recommender Systems for Banking and Financial Services (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Danele Regoli, Andrea Gigli, Fabrizio Lillo</p>
    <p>In this work we demonstrate the usefulness of the application of Recommender Systems in the financial domain. Specifically we investigate a dataset, made available by a major European bank, containing the purchases of a large set of investment assets by 200k investors. We also present some preliminary results of the application of network analysis via statistical validation to identify clusters of investment assets.</p>

    <h3>Network-Based Extension of Multi-Relational Factorization Models (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Burke, Bamshad Mobasher, Fatemeh Vahedian</p>
    <p>Complex heterogeneous networks contain many types of relations, both local to a particular entity and distant in the network. Multi-relational factorization schemes that incorporate multiple local relations have shown improved recommendation accuracy. This paper extends this prior work on multi-relational factorization to include extended relations derived from network data and demonstrates improved accuracy for these extended hybrids.</p>

    <h3>Inferring User Interests in the Twitter Social Network (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Zafar, Krishna Gummadi, Parantapa Bhattacharya, Niloy Ganguly, Saptarshi Ghosh</p>
    <p>We propose a novel mechanism to infer topics of interest of individual users in the Twitter microblogging site. We observe that in Twitter, a user generally follows experts on various topics of her interest to acquire authentic information on those topics. We use a methodology based on social annotations (proposed earlier by us) to deduce the topical expertise of popular Twitter users, and then transitively infer the interests of the users who are following them. This methodology of inferring user-interests is a sharp departure from the traditional techniques of inferring interests of a user from the tweets that she posts or receives. The topics of interest inferred by the proposed methodology are found to be much superior than the topics extracted by state-of-the-art techniques such as using topic models (Labeled LDA) on tweets. Based upon the proposed methodology, we build a system Who Likes What, which can infer the interests of millions of Twitter users. To our knowledge, this is the first methodology / system that can infer interests for such large number of Twitter users, which would be particularly beneficial in developing personalized recommendation services over the Twitter platform.</p>
