    <h3>Adaptive Fusion of Multi-View for Graph Contrastive Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Zhou, Jianwei Yin, Meng Xi, Ying Li, Mengduo Yang, Xiaohua Pan, Yi Yuan, Yangyang Wu, Jinshan Zhang</p>
    <p>Recommendation is a key mechanism for modern users to access items of their interests from massive entities and information. Recently, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has demonstrated satisfactory results on recommendation, due to its ability to enhance representation by integrating graph neural networks (GNNs) with contrastive learning. However, those methods often generate contrastive views by performing random perturbation on edges or embeddings, which is likely to bring noise in representation learning. Besides, in all these methods, the degree of user preference on items is omitted during the representation learning process, which may cause incomplete user/item modeling. To address these limitations, we propose the Adaptive Fusion of Multi-View Graph Contrastive Recommendation (AMGCR) model. Specifically, to generate the informative and less noisy views for better contrastive learning, we design four view generators to learn the edge weights focusing on weight adjustment, feature transformation, neighbor aggregation, and attention mechanism, respectively. Then, we employ an adaptive multi-view fusion module to combine different views from both the view-shared and the view-specific levels. Moreover, to make the model capable of capturing preference information during the learning process, we further adopt a preference refinement strategy on the fused contrastive view. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AMGCR consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, with average improvements of over 10% in terms of Recall and NDCG.</p>

    <h3>Progressive Horizon Learning: Adaptive Long Term Optimization for Personalized Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Ni, Shreya Chakrabarti, Congrui Yi, David Zumwalt</p>
    <p>As B2C companies such as Amazon, Netflix, Spotify scale, personalized recommender systems are often needed to further drive long term business growth in acquisition, engagement, and retention of customers. However, long-term metrics associated with these goals can require several months to mature. Additionally, deep personalization also demands a large volume of training data that take a long time to collect. These factors incur substantial lead time for training a model to optimize a long-term metric. Before such model is deployed, a recommender system has to rely on a simple policy (e.g. random) to collect customer feedback data for training, inflicting high opportunity cost and delaying optimization of the target metric. Besides, as customer preferences can shift over time, a large temporal gap between inputs and outcome poses a high risk of data staleness and suboptimal learning. Existing approaches involve various compromises. For instance, contextual bandits often optimize short-term surrogate metrics with simple model structure, which can be suboptimal in the long run, while Reinforcement Learning approaches rely on an abundance of historical data for offline training, which essentially means long lead time before deployment. To address these problems, we propose Progressive Horizon Learning Recommender (PHLRec), a personalized model that can progressively learn metric patterns and adaptively evolve from short- to long-term optimization over time. Through simulations and real data experiments, we demonstrated that PHLRec outperforms competing methods, achieving optimality in both deployment speed and long-term metric performances.</p>

    <h3>Adaptive Collaborative Filtering with Personalized Time Decay Functions for Financial Product Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baptiste Barreau, Michalis Vazirgiannis, Ashraf Ghiye, Laurent Carlier</p>
    <p>Classical recommender systems often assume that historical data are stationary and fail to account for the dynamic nature of user preferences, limiting their ability to provide reliable recommendations in time-sensitive settings. This assumption is particularly problematic in finance, where financial products exhibit continuous changes in valuations, leading to frequent shifts in client interests. These evolving interests, summarized in the past client-product interactions, see their utility fade over time with a degree that might differ from one client to another. To address this challenge, we propose a time-dependent collaborative filtering algorithm that can adaptively discount distant client-product interactions using personalized decay functions. Our approach is designed to handle the non-stationarity of financial data and produce reliable recommendations by modeling the dynamic collaborative signals between clients and products. We evaluate our method using a proprietary dataset from BNP Paribas and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art benchmarks from relevant literature. Our findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time explicitly in the model to enhance the accuracy of financial product recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Adaptive Pointwise-Pairwise Learning-to-Rank for Content-based Personalized Recommendation (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Michel Renders, Yagmur Gizem Cinar</p>
    <p>This paper extends the standard pointwise and pairwise paradigms for learning-to-rank in the context of personalized recommendation, by considering these two approaches as two extremes of a continuum of possible strategies. It basically consists of a surrogate loss that models how to select and combine these two approaches adaptively, depending on the context (query or user, pair of items, etc.). In other words, given a training instance, which is typically a triplet (a query/user and two items with different preferences or relevance grades), the strategy adaptively determines whether it is better to focus on the “most preferred” item (pointwise - positive instance), on the “less preferred” one (pointwise - negative instance) or on the pair (pairwise), or on anything else in between these 3 extreme alternatives. We formulate this adaptive strategy as minimizing a particular loss function that generalizes simultaneously the traditional pointwise and pairwise loss functions (negative log-likelihood) through a mixture coefficient. This coefficient is formulated as a learnable function of the features associated to the triplet. Experimental results on several real-world news recommendation datasets show clear improvements over several pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches.</p>

    <h3>Adaptive Collaborative Topic Modeling for Online Recommendation (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre-Alexandre Murena, Marie Al-Ghossein, Talel Abdessalem, Anthony Barré, Antoine Cornuéjols</p>
    <p>Collaborative filtering (CF) mainly suffers from rating sparsity and from the cold-start problem. Auxiliary information like texts and images has been leveraged to alleviate these problems, resulting in hybrid recommender systems (RS). Due to the abundance of data continuously generated in real-world applications, it has become essential to design online RS that are able to handle user feedback and the availability of new items in real-time. These systems are also required to adapt to drifts when a change in the data distribution is detected. In this paper, we propose an adaptive collaborative topic modeling approach, CoAWILDA, as a hybrid system relying on adaptive online Latent Dirichlet Allocation (AWILDA) to model new available items arriving as a document stream and incremental matrix factorization for CF. The topic model is maintained up-to-date in an online fashion and is retrained in batch when a drift is detected, using documents automatically selected by an adaptive windowing technique. Our experiments on real-world datasets prove the effectiveness of our approach for online recommendation.</p>

    <h3>A Gradient-based Adaptive Learning Framework for Efficient Personal Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liangjie Hong, Yue Shi, Naren Ramakrishnan, Huzefa Rangwala, Yue Ning</p>
    <p>Recommending personalized content to users is a long-standing challenge to many online services including Facebook, Yahoo, Linkedin and Twitter. Traditional recommendation models such as latent factor models and feature-based models are usually trained for all users and optimize an “average” experience for them, yielding sub-optimal solutions. Although multi-task learning provides an opportunity to learn personalized models per user, learning algorithms are usually tailored to specific models (e.g., generalized linear model, matrix factorization and etc.), creating obstacles for a unified engineering interface, which is important for large Internet companies. In this paper, we present an empirical framework to learn user-specific personal models for content recommendation by utilizing gradient information from a global model. Our proposed method can potentially benefit any model that can be optimized through gradients, offering a lightweight yet generic alternative to conventional multi-task learning algorithms for user personalization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by incorporating it in three popular machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, gradient boosting decision tree and matrix factorization. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that the proposed framework can significantly improve the efficiency of personalized recommendation in real-world datasets.</p>
