    <h3>A Dataset for Adapting Recommender Systems to the Fashion Rental Economy (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jivitesh Sharma, Karl Audun Borgersen, Morten Goodwin, Morten Grundetjern</p>
    <p>In response to the escalating ecological challenges that threaten global sustainability, there’s a deep need to investigate alternative methods of commerce, such as rental economies. Like most online commerce, rental or otherwise, a functioning recommender system is crucial for their success. Yet the domain has, until this point, been largely neglected by the recommender system research community. Our dataset, derived from our collaboration with the leading Norwegian fashion rental company [Company name omitted for review process], encompasses 64k transactions, rental histories from 2.2k anonymized users, and 15.8k unique outfits in which each physical item’s attributes and rental history is meticulously tracked. All outfits are listed as individual items or their corresponding item groups, referring to shared designs between the individual items. This approach underlines the novel challenges of rental as compared to more traditional recommender system problems where items are generally interchangeable. Each outfit is accompanied by a set of tags describing some of their attributes. We also provide a total of 50k images displaying across all items along with a set of precomputed zero-shot embeddings. We apply a myriad of common recommender system methods to the dataset to provide a performance baseline. This baseline is performed for the traditional fashion recommender system problem of recommending outfit groups and the novel problem of predicting individual item rental. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset discussing the domain of clothes rental. It is our hope that the publication of this dataset will serve as a catalyst for a new branch of research for specialized fashion rental recommender systems. The dataset is temporarily hosted at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/clothes_rental_dataset-B1E8/ and Google Cloud at https: //console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/clothes-rental-dataset The code for collecting, processing, and evaluating the dataset is hosted at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Vibrent_Dataset_Collection-03DC/</p>

    <h3>Multi-Modal Dialog State Tracking for Interactive Fashion Recommendation (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iadh Ounis, Craig Macdonald, Yaxiong Wu</p>
    <p>Multi-modal interactive recommendation is a type of task that allows users to receive visual recommendations and express natural-language feedback about the recommended items across multiple iterations of interactions. However, such multi-modal dialog sequences (i.e. turns consisting of the system’s visual recommendations and the user’s natural-language feedback) make it challenging to correctly incorporate the users’ preferences across multiple turns. Indeed, the existing formulations of interactive recommender systems suffer from their inability to capture the multi-modal sequential dependencies of textual feedback and visual recommendations because of their use of recurrent neural network-based (i.e., RNN-based) or transformer-based models. To alleviate the multi-modal sequential dependency issue, we propose a novel multi-modal recurrent attention network (MMRAN) model to effectively incorporate the users’ preferences over the long visual dialog sequences of the users’ natural-language feedback and the system’s visual recommendations. Specifically, we leverage a gated recurrent network (GRN) with a feedback gate to separately process the textual and visual representations of natural-language feedback and visual recommendations into hidden states (i.e. representations of the past interactions) for multi-modal sequence combination. In addition, we apply a multi-head attention network (MAN) to refine the hidden states generated by the GRN and to further enhance the model’s ability in dynamic state tracking. Following previous work, we conduct extensive experiments on the Fashion IQ Dresses, Shirts, and Tops & Tees datasets to assess the effectiveness of our proposed model by using a vision-language transformer-based user simulator as a surrogate for real human users. Our results show that our proposed MMRAN model can significantly outperform several existing state-of-the-art baseline models.</p>

    <h3>Tops, Bottoms, and Shoes: Building Capsule Wardrobes via Cross-Attention Tensor Network (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Yang, Fei Wang, Yusan Lin, Huiyuan Chen</p>
    <p>Fashion is more than Paris runways. Fashion is about how people express their interests, identity, mood, and cultural influences. Given an inventory of candidate garments from different categories, how to assemble them together would most improve their fashionability? This question presents an intriguing visual recommendation challenge to automatically create capsule wardrobes. Capsule wardrobe generation is a complex combinatorial problem that requires the understanding of how multiple visual items interact. The generative process often needs fashion experts to manually tease the combinations out, making it hard to scale.<br>We introduce TensorNet, an approach that captures the key ingredients of visual compatibility among tops, bottoms, and shoes. TensorNet aims to provide actionable advice for full-body clothing outfits that mix and match well. Our TensorNet consists of two core modules: a Cross-Attention Message Passing module and a Wide&Deep Tensor Interaction module. As such, TensorNet is able to characterize the local region-based patterns as well as the global compatibility of the entire outfits. Our experimental results on the real-word datasets indicate that the proposed method is capable of learning visual compatibility and outperforms all the baselines. TensorNet opens up opportunities for fashion designers to narrow down the search space for multi-clothes combinations.</p>

    <h3>A Hierarchical Bayesian Model for Size Recommendation in Fashion (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuen King Ho, Abdul-Saboor Sheikh, Evgenyi Koryagin, Reza Shirvany, Urs Bergmann, Romain Guigourès</p>
    <p>We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian approach to tackle the challenging problem of size recommendation in e-commerce fashion. Our approach jointly models a size purchased by a customer, and its possible return event: 1. no return, 2. returned too small 3. returned too big. Those events are drawn following a multinomial distribution parameterized on the joint probability of each event, built following a hierarchy combining priors. Such a model allows us to incorporate extended domain expertise and article characteristics as prior knowledge, which in turn makes it possible for the underlying parameters to emerge thanks to sufficient data. Experiments are presented on real (anonymized) data from millions of customers along with a detailed discussion on the efficiency of such an approach within a large scale production system.</p>

    <h3>Practical Lessons from Developing a Large-Scale Recommender System at Zalando (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonino Freno</p>
    <p>Developing a real-world recommender system, i.e. for use in large-scale online retail, poses a number of different challenges. Interestingly, only a small part of these challenges are of algorithmic nature, such as how to select the most accurate model for a given use case. Instead, most technical problems usually arise from operational constraints, such as: adaptation to novel use cases; cost and complexity of system maintenance; capability of reusing pre-existing signal and integrating heterogeneous data sources. In this paper, we describe the system we developed in order to address those constraints at Zalando, which is one of the most popular online fashion retailers in Europe. In particular, we explain how moving from a collaborative filtering approach to a learning-to-rank model helped us to effectively tackle the challenges mentioned above, while improving at the same time the quality of our recommendations. A fairly detailed description of our software architecture is provided, along with an overview of the algorithmic approach. On the other hand, we present some of the offline and online experiments that we ran in order to validate our models.</p>

    <h3>Style Recommendation for Fashion Items using Heterogeneous Information Network (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang-Goo Lee, Hanbit Lee</p>
    <p>In the midst of vast amounts of available fashion items, consumers today require more efficient recommendation services. A system that sorts out items that form a stylish ensemble with already selected or possessed items would provide them with greater convenience. In this paper, we propose a fashion item recommendation method that learns the way the fashion items are matched from a large ensemble database. We empirically show that the proposed method can explain factors that affect item matching and recommend the most suitable items to the given set of items.</p>
