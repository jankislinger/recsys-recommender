    <h3>GLAMOR: Graph-based LAnguage MOdel embedding for citation Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilin Qi, Adam A. Q. Mohammed, Irfan Ullah, Khan Muhammad, Pavlos Kefalas, Zafar Ali</p>
    <p>Digital publishing’s exponential growth has created vast scholarly collections. Guiding researchers to relevant resources is crucial, and knowledge graphs (KGs) are key tools for unlocking hidden knowledge. However, current methods focus on external links between concepts, ignoring the rich information within individual papers. Challenges like insufficient multi-relational data, name ambiguity, and cold-start issues further limit existing KG-based methods, failing to capture the intricate attributes of diverse entities. To solve these issues, we propose GLAMOR, a robust KG framework encompassing entities e.g., authors, papers, fields of study, and concepts, along with their semantic interconnections. GLAMOR uses a novel random walk-based KG text generation method and then fine-tunes the language model using the generated text. Subsequently, the acquired context-preserving embeddings facilitate superior top@k predictions. Evaluation results on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate our GLAMOR’s superiority against state-of-the-art methods especially in solving the cold-start problem.</p>

    <h3>A Multi-view Graph Contrastive Learning Framework for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zitao Xu, Weike Pan, Zhong Ming</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation methods play an irreplaceable role in recommender systems which can capture the users’ dynamic preferences from the behavior sequences. Despite their success, these works usually suffer from the sparsity problem commonly existed in real applications. Cross-domain sequential recommendation aims to alleviate this problem by introducing relatively richer source-domain data. However, most existing methods capture the users’ preferences independently of each domain, which may neglect the item transition patterns across sequences from different domains, i.e., a user’s interaction in one domain may influence his/her next interaction in other domains. Moreover, the data sparsity problem still exists since some items in the target and source domains are interacted with only a limited number of times. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a generic framework named multi-view graph contrastive learning (MGCL). Specifically, we adopt the contrastive mechanism in an intra-domain item representation view and an inter-domain user preference view. The former is to jointly learn the dynamic sequential information in the user sequence graph and the static collaborative information in the cross-domain global graph, while the latter is to capture the complementary information of the user’s preferences from different domains. Extensive empirical studies on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our MGCL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <h3>Modeling Two-Way Selection Preference for Person-Job Fit (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yupeng Hou, Wayne Xin Zhao, Chen Yang, Yang Song, Tao Zhang, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
    <p>Person-job fit is the core technique of online recruitment platforms, which can improve the efficiency of recruitment by accurately matching the job positions with the job seekers. Existing works mainly focus on modeling the unidirectional process or overall matching. However, recruitment is a two-way selection process, which means that both candidate and employer involved in the interaction should meet the expectation of each other, instead of unilateral satisfaction. In this paper, we propose a dual-perspective graph representation learning approach to model directed interactions between candidates and jobs. To model the two-way selection preference from the dual-perspective of job seekers and employers, we incorporate two different nodes for each candidate (or job) and characterize both successful matching and failed matching via a unified dual-perspective interaction graph. To learn dual-perspective node representations effectively, we design an effective optimization algorithm, which involves a quadruple-based loss and a dual-perspective contrastive learning loss. Extensive experiments on three large real-world recruitment datasets have shown the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/DPGNN .</p>

    <h3>Cold Start Similar Artists Ranking with Gravity-Inspired Graph Autoencoders (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Romain Hennequin, Benjamin Chapus, Guillaume Salha-Galvan, Michalis Vazirgiannis, Viet-Anh Tran</p>
    <p>On an artist’s profile page, music streaming services frequently recommend a ranked list of ”similar artists” that fans also liked. However, implementing such a feature is challenging for new artists, for which usage data on the service (e.g. streams or likes) is not yet available. In this paper, we model this cold start similar artists ranking problem as a link prediction task in a directed and attributed graph, connecting artists to their top-k most similar neighbors and incorporating side musical information. Then, we leverage a graph autoencoder architecture to learn node embedding representations from this graph, and to automatically rank the top-k most similar neighbors of new artists using a gravity-inspired mechanism. We empirically show the flexibility and the effectiveness of our framework, by addressing a real-world cold start similar artists ranking problem on a global music streaming service. Along with this paper, we also publicly release our source code and the industrial data from our experiments.</p>

    <h3>Tripartite Heterogeneous Graph Propagation for Large-scale Social Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donghyun Kwak, Minkyu Kim, Hanock Kwak, Jae-Han Cho, Nako Sung, Jung-Woo Ha, Kyung-Min Kim, Sangkwon Sim, Young-Jin Park, Jihun Kwon</p>
    <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been emerging as a promising method for relational representation including recommender systems. However, various challenging issues of social graphs hinder the practical usage of GNNs for social recommendation, such as their complex noisy connections and high heterogeneity. The oversmoothing of GNNs is an obstacle of GNN-based social recommendation as well. Here we propose a new graph embedding method Heterogeneous Graph Propagation (HGP) to tackle these issues. HGP uses a group-user-item tripartite graph as input to reduce the number of edges and the complexity of paths in a social graph. To solve the oversmoothing issue, HGP embeds nodes under a personalized PageRank based propagation scheme, separately for group-user graph and user-item graph. Node embeddings from each graph are integrated using an attention mechanism. We evaluate our HGP on a large-scale real-world dataset consisting of 1,645,279 nodes and 4,711,208 edges. The experimental results show that HGP outperforms several baselines in terms of AUC and F1-score metrics.</p>

    <h3>Attribute-Aware Non-Linear Co-Embeddings of Graph Features (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Rashed, Lars Schmidt-Thieme, Josif Grabocka</p>
    <p>In very sparse recommender data sets, attributes of users such as age, gender and home location and attributes of items such as, in the case of movies, genre, release year, and director can improve the recommendation accuracy, especially for users and items that have few ratings. While most recommendation models can be extended to take attributes of users and items into account, their architectures usually become more complicated. While attributes for items are often easy to be provided, attributes for users are often scarce for reasons of privacy or simply because they are not relevant to the operational process at hand. In this paper, we address these two problems for attribute-aware recommender systems by proposing a simple model that co-embeds users and items into a joint latent space in a similar way as a vanilla matrix factorization, but with non-linear latent features construction that seamlessly can ingest user or item attributes or both (GraphRec). To address the second problem, scarce attributes, the proposed model treats the user-item relation as a bipartite graph and constructs generic user and item attributes via the Laplacian of the user-item co-occurrence graph that requires no further external side information but the mere rating matrix. In experiments on three recommender datasets, we show that GraphRec significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art attribute-aware and content-aware recommender systems even without using any side information.</p>

    <h3>Explainable Entity-based Recommendations with Knowledge Graphs (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William Cohen, Maxine Eskenazi, Rose Catherine, Kathryn Mazaitis</p>
    <p>Explainable recommendation is an important task. Many methods have been proposed which generate explanations from the content and reviews written for items. When review text is unavailable, generating explanations is still a hard problem. In this paper, we illustrate how explanations can be generated in such a scenario by leveraging external knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs. Our method jointly ranks items and knowledge graph entities using a Personalized PageRank procedure to produce recommendations together with their explanations.</p>

    <h3>Music Playlist Recommendation via Preference Embedding (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chih-Chun Hsia, Ming-Feng Tsai, Yian Chen, Chih-Ming Chen, Chun-Yao Yang</p>
    <p>Music playlists usually contain some particular musical styles or atmospheres in which users would like to be involved. Music streaming services, such as Spotify, Apple Music, and KKBOX, even allow users to edit and listen to playlists online. While it has been some well-known methods that can nicely model the preference between users and songs, little has been done in the literature to recommend music playlists, each of which can be considered as a set of many individual songs, to users. In the light of this, this paper proposes a preference embedding based on a user-song-playlist graph to learn the preference representations of these three entities. After the embedding process, we then use the learned representations to perform the task of playlist recommendation. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset show that the proposed embedding method outperforms the baseline of popularity; in addition, we also make a comparison with DeepWalk and LINE for the recommendation task, and the results show that the proposed method can stand comparison with the two state-of-the-art graph embedding techniques.</p>

    <h3>ExpLOD: A Framework for Explaining Recommendations based on the Linked Open Data Cloud (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fedelucio Narducci, Pasquale Lops, Marco De Gemmis, Giovanni Semeraro, Cataldo Musto</p>
    <p>In this paper we present ExpLOD, a framework which exploits the information available in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud to generate a natural language explanation of the suggestions produced by a recommendation algorithm. The methodology is based on building a graph in which the items liked by a user are connected to the items recommended through the properties available in the LOD cloud. Next, given this graph, we implemented some techniques to rank those properties and we used the most relevant ones to feed a module for generating explanations in natural language. In the experimental evaluation we performed a user study with 308 subjects aiming to investigate to what extent our explanation framework can lead to more transparent, trustful and engaging recommendations. The preliminary results provided us with encouraging findings, since our algorithm performed better than both a non-personalized explanation baseline and a popularity-based one.</p>

    <h3>MAPS: A Multi Aspect Personalized POI Recommender System (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Li, Ramesh Baral</p>
    <p>The evolution of the World Wide Web (WWW) and the smart-phone technologies have played a key role in the revolution of our daily life. The location-based social networks (LBSN) have emerged and facilitated the users to share the check-in information and multimedia contents. The Point of Interest (POI) recommendation system uses the check-in information to predict the most potential check-in locations. The different aspects of the check-in information, for instance, the geographical distance, the category, and the temporal popularity of a POI; and the temporal check-in trends, and the social (friendship) information of a user play a crucial role in an efficient recommendation. In this paper, we propose a fused recommendation model termed MAPS (Multi Aspect Personalized POI Recommender System) which will be the first in our knowledge to fuse the categorical, the temporal, the social and the spatial aspects in a single model. The major contribution of this paper are: (i) it realizes the problem as a graph of location nodes with constraints on the category and the distance aspects (i.e. the edge between two locations is constrained by a threshold distance and the category of the locations), (ii) it proposes a multi-aspect fused POI recommendation model, and (iii) it extensively evaluates the model with two real-world data sets.</p>

    <h3>A Coverage-Based Approach to Recommendation Diversity On Similarity Graph (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Usunier, Shameem A Puthiya Parambath, Yves Grandvalet</p>
    <p>We consider the problem of generating diverse, personalized recommendations such that a small set of recommended items covers a broad range of the user’s interests. We represent items in a similarity graph, and we formulate the relevance/diversity trade-off as finding a small set of unrated items that best covers a subset of items positively rated by the user. In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not rely on an explicit trade-off between a relevance objective and a diversity objective, as the estimations of relevance and diversity are implicit in the coverage criterion. We show on several benchmark datasets that our approach compares favorably to the state-of-the-art diversification methods according to various relevance and diversity measures.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Latent Social Listening Representations for Music Recommendations (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Hsuan Yang, Ming-Feng Tsai, Yu-Ching Lin, Chih-Ming Chen, Po-Chuan Chien</p>
    <p>Music listening can be regarded as a social activity, in which people can listen together and make friends with one other. Therefore, social relationships may imply multiple facets of the users, such as their listening behaviors and tastes. In this light, it is considered that social relationships hold abundant valuable information that can be utilized for music recommendation. However, utilizing the information for recommendation could be difficult, because such information is usually sparse. To address this issue, we propose to learn the latent social listening representations by the DeepWalk method, and then integrate the learned representations into Factorization Machines to construct better recommendation models. With the DeepWalk method, user social relationships can be transformed from the sparse and independent and identically distributed ( ) form into a dense and non- form. In addition, the latent representations can also capture the spatial locality among users and items, therefore benefiting the constructed recommendation models.</p>

    <h3>Blockbusters and Wallflowers: Accurate, Diverse, and Scalable Recommendations with Random Walks (2015)</h3>

    <p>User satisfaction is often dependent on providing accurate and diverse recommendations. In this paper, we explore scalable algorithms that exploit random walks as a sampling technique to obtain diverse recommendations without compromising on accuracy. Specifically, we present a novel graph vertex ranking recommendation algorithm called RP3beta that re-ranks items based on 3-hop random walk transition probabilities. We show empirically, that RP3beta provides accurate recommendations with high long-tail item frequency at the top of the recommendation list. We also present scalable approximate versions of RP3beta and the two most accurate previously published vertex ranking algorithms based on random walk transition probabilities and show that these approximations converge with increasing number of samples.</p>

    <h3>A Robust Model for Paper-Reviewer Assignment (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Liu, Nasir Memon, Torsten Suel</p>
    <p>Automatic expert assignment is a common problem encountered in both industry and academia. For example, for conference program chairs and journal editors, in order to collect “good” judgments for a paper, it is necessary for them to assign the paper to the most appropriate reviewers. Choosing appropriate reviewers of course includes a number of considerations such as expertise and authority, but also diversity and avoiding conflicts. In this paper, we explore the expert retrieval problem and implement an automatic paper-reviewer recommendation system that considers aspects of expertise, authority, and diversity. In particular, a graph is first constructed on the possible reviewers and the query paper, incorporating expertise and authority information. Then a Random Walk with Restart (RWR) model is employed on the graph with a sparsity constraint, incorporating diversity information. Extensive experiments on two reviewer recommendation benchmark datasets show that the proposed method obtains performance gains over the state-of-the-art reviewer recommendation systems in terms of expertise, authority, diversity, and, most importantly, relevance as judged by human experts.</p>

    <h3>Random Walk with Wait and Restart on Document Co-citation Network for Similar Document Search (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masaki Eto</p>
    <p>One of the latest algorithms for computing similarities between nodes in a graph is Random Walk with Restart (RWR). However, on a document co-citation network for similar document search, computing transition probabilities remains difficult. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a Random Walk with Wait and Restart (RWWR) algorithm, which contains a new technique for adjusting the transition probability by incorporating a “selfreturning” edge into the normalization. To evaluate its effectiveness empirically, the search performance of two retrieval methods using RWWR was compared to a method using the standard RWR; the performance was measured by average precision and nDCG. The experiment was conducted on a test collection created from the Open Access Subset of PubMed Central, and the results indicated that the RWWR methods tend to outperform the standard RWR method.</p>
