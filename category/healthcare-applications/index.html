    <h3>Understanding Fairness in Recommender Systems: A Healthcare Perspective (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veronica Kecki, Alan Said</p>
    <p>Fairness in AI-driven decision-making systems has become a critical concern, especially when these systems directly affect human lives. This paper explores the public’s comprehension of fairness in healthcare recommendations. We conducted a survey where participants selected from four fairness metrics – Demographic Parity, Equal Accuracy, Equalized Odds, and Positive Predictive Value – across different healthcare scenarios to assess their understanding of these concepts. Our findings reveal that fairness is a complex and often misunderstood concept, with a generally low level of public understanding regarding fairness metrics in recommender systems. This study highlights the need for enhanced information and education on algorithmic fairness to support informed decision-making in using these systems. Furthermore, the results suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach to fairness may be insufficient, pointing to the importance of context-sensitive designs in developing equitable AI systems.</p>

    <h3>Recommending Social-Interactive Games for Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Soledad Pera, Yiu-Kai D. Ng</p>
    <p>Games play a significant role in modern society, since they affect people of all ages and all walks of life, whether it be socially or mentally, and have direct impacts on adults with autism. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by qualitative impairments in social relatedness and interaction, as well as difficulties in acquiring and using communication and language abilities. Adults with ASD often find it difficult to express and recognize emotions which makes it hard for them to interact with others socially. We have designed new interactive and collaborative games for autistic adults and developed a novel strategy to recommend games to them. Using modern computer vision and graphics techniques, we (i) track the player’s speech rate, facial features, eye contact, audio communication, and emotional states, and (ii) foster their collaboration. These games are personalized and recommended to a user based on games interested to the user, besides the complexity of games at different levels according to the deficient level of the emotional understanding and social skills to which the user belongs. The objective of developing and recommending short-head (i.e., familiar) and long-tail (i.e., unfamiliar) games for adults with ASD is to enhance their necessary social interacting skills with peers so that they can live a normal life.</p>
