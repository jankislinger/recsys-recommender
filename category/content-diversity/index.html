    <h3>AI-based Human-Centered Recommender Systems: Empirical Experiments and Research Infrastructure (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixuan Sun</p>
    <p>This is a dissertation plan built around human-centered empirical experiments evaluating recommender systems (RecSys). We see this as an important research theme since many AI-based RecSys algorithmic studies lack real human assessment. Therefore, we do not know how they work in the wild that only human experiments can tell us. We split this extended abstract into two parts — 1) A series of individual studies focusing on open questions about different human values or recommendation algorithms. Our completed works include user control over content diversity, user appreciation on DL-RecSys algorithms, and human-LLMRec interaction study. We also propose three future works to understand news recommendation depolarization, personalized news podcast, and interactive user representation; 2) An experimentation infrastructure named POPROX. As a personalized news recommendation platform, it aims to support the longitudinal study needs from the general AI and RecSys research community.</p>

    <h3>“More to Read” at the Los Angeles Times: Solving a Cold Start Problem with LLMs to Improve Story Discovery (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Kaufman, Franklin Horn, Aurelia Alston, Won You</p>
    <p>News publishers, who are seeking to grow their digital audience, face a challenge in providing relevant content recommendations for unregistered users arriving directly to article pages. In these cold start scenarios, classic techniques, like asking a user to register and select topics of interest, fall short. We present a contextual targeting approach that leverages the user’s current article choice itself as an implicit signal of user interests. We designed and developed an interface with recommendations to help users discover more articles. Our online A/B testing demonstrated that our models increased click-through rates by 39.4% over a popularity baseline. One of them, a large language model (LLM), generates relevant recommendations that balance immersion and novelty. We discuss the implications of using LLMs for responsibly enhancing user experiences while upholding editorial standards. We identify key opportunities in detecting nuanced user preferences and identifying and interrupting filter bubbles on news publisher sites.</p>

    <h3>Personalised Recommendations for the BBC iPlayer: Initial approach and current challenges (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Polina Proutskova, Benjamin R. Clark, Duncan M. Walker, Kristine Grivcova</p>
    <p>BBC iPlayer is one of the most important digital products of the BBC, offering live and on-demand television for audiences in the UK with over 10 million weekly active users. The BBC’s role as a public service broadcaster, broadcasting over traditional linear channels as well as online presents a number of challenges for a recommender system. In addition to having substantially different objectives to a commercial service, we show that the diverse content offered by the BBC including news and sport, factual, drama and live events lead to a catalogue with a diversity of consumption patterns, depending on genre. Our research shows that simple models represent strong baselines in this system. We discuss our initial attempts to improve upon these baselines, and conclude with our current challenges.</p>

    <h3>Follow the guides: disentangling human and algorithmic curation in online music consumption (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel Moussallam, Camille Roth, Thomas Louail, Quentin Villermet, Jérémie Poiroux</p>
    <p>The role of recommendation systems in the diversity of content consumption on platforms is a much-debated issue. The quantitative state of the art often overlooks the existence of individual attitudes toward guidance, and eventually of different categories of users in this regard. Focusing on the case of music streaming, we analyze the complete listening history of about 9k users over one year and demonstrate that there is no blanket answer to the intertwinement of recommendation use and consumption diversity: it depends on users. First we compute for each user the relative importance of different access modes within their listening history, introducing a trichotomy distinguishing so-called ‘organic’ use from algorithmic and editorial guidance. We thereby identify four categories of users. We then focus on two scales related to content diversity, both in terms of dispersion – how much users consume the same content repeatedly – and popularity – how popular is the content they consume. We show that the two types of recommendation offered by music platforms – algorithmic and editorial – may drive the consumption of more or less diverse content in opposite directions, depending also strongly on the type of users. Finally, we compare users’ streaming histories with the music programming of a selection of popular French radio stations during the same period. While radio programs are usually more tilted toward repetition than users’ listening histories, they often program more songs from less popular artists. On the whole, our results highlight the nontrivial effects of platform-mediated recommendation on consumption, and lead us to speak of ‘filter niches’ rather than ‘filter bubbles’. They hint at further ramifications for the study and design of recommendation systems.</p>

    <h3>Diversified Utility Maximization for Recommendation (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Branislav Kveton, Shlomo Berkovsky, Azin Ashkan, Zheng Wen</p>
    <p>Consider the problem of recommending items to a group of users subject to the diversity of their tastes. The goal is to recommend a list of items, such that the interests of each user are covered. We cast this problem as maximizing a diversified utility function of the group, the optimal solution of which can be found greedily. We conduct a user study in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Evaluation results show that our method represents an effective strategy compared to various settings in which a convex combination of utility and diversity is maximized.</p>
