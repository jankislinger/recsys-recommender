    <h3>Context-Aware Event Recommendation in Event-based Social Networks (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leandro B. Marinho, Rodrygo L. T. Santos, Augusto Q. Macedo</p>
    <p>The Web has grown into one of the most important channels to communicate social events nowadays. However, the sheer volume of events available in event-based social networks (EBSNs) often undermines the users’ ability to choose the events that best fit their interests. Recommender systems appear as a natural solution for this problem, but differently from classic recommendation scenarios (e.g. movies, books), the event recommendation problem is intrinsically cold-start. Indeed, events published in EBSNs are typically short-lived and, by definition, are always in the future, having little or no trace of historical attendance. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit several contextual signals available from EBSNs. In particular, besides content-based signals based on the events’ description and collaborative signals derived from users’ RSVPs, we exploit social signals based on group memberships, location signals based on the users’ geographical preferences, and temporal signals derived from the users’ time preferences. Moreover, we combine the proposed signals for learning to rank events for personalized recommendation. Thorough experiments using a large crawl of Meetup.com demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed contextual learning approach in contrast to state-of-the-art event recommenders from the literature.</p>

    <h3>Asymmetric Recommendations: The Interacting Effects of Social Ratings’ Direction and Strength on Users’ Ratings (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oded Nov, Ofer Arazy</p>
    <p>In social recommendation systems, users often publicly rate objects such as photos, news articles or consumer products. When they appear in aggregate, these ratings carry social signals such as the direction and strength of the raters’ average opinion about the product. Using a controlled experiment we manipulated two central social signals – the direction and strength of social ratings of five popular consumer products – and examined their interacting effects on users’ ratings. The results show an asymmetric user behavior, where the direction of perceived social rating has a negative effect on users’ ratings if the direction of perceived social rating is negative, but no effect if the direction is positive. The strength of perceived social ratings did not have a significant effect on users’ ratings. The findings highlight the potential for cascading adverse effects of small number of negative user ratings on subsequent users’ opinions.</p>
