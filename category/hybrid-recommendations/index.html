    <h3>Neighborhood-Based Collaborative Filtering for Conversational Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Mcauley, Zhouhang Xie, Nathan Kallus, Dawen Liang, Rahul Jha, Hyunsik Jeon, Zhankui He, Harald Steck, Junda Wu</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) should understand users’ expressed interests that are frequently semantically rich and knowledge intensive. Prior works attempt to address this challenge by making use of external knowledge bases or parametric knowledge in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we study a complementary solution, exploiting item knowledge in the training data. We hypothesise that many inference-time user requests can be answered via reusing popular crowd-written answers associated with similar training queries. Following this intuition, we define a class of neighborhood-based CRS that make recommendations by identifying popular items associated with similar training dialogue contexts. Experiments on Inspired, Redial, and Reddit benchmarks show that despite its simplicity, our method achieves comparable to better performance than state-of-the-art LLM-based methods with over 200 times more parameters. We also show neighborhood and model-based predictions can be combined to achieve further performance improvements over both components.</p>

    <h3>Together is Better: Hybrid Recommendations Combining Graph Embeddings and Contextualized Word Representations (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco de Gemmis, Cataldo Musto, Marco Polignano, Pasquale Lops, Giovanni Semeraro</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present a hybrid recommendation framework based on the combination of graph embeddings and contextual word representations. Our approach is based on the intuition that each of the above mentioned representation models heterogeneous (and equally important) information, that is worth to be taken into account to generate a recommendation. Accordingly, we propose a strategy to combine both the features, which is based on the following steps: first, we separately generate graph embeddings and contextual word representations by exploiting state-of-the-art techniques. Next, these embeddings are used to feed a deep architecture that learns a hybrid representation based on the combination of the single groups of features. Finally, we exploit the resulting embedding to identify suitable recommendations. In the experimental session, we evaluate the effectiveness of our strategy on two datasets and results show that the use of a hybrid representation leads to an improvement of the predictive accuracy. Moreover, our approach overcomes several competitive baselines, thus confirming the validity of this work.</p>

    <h3>DualDiv: Diversifying Items and Explanation Styles in Explainable Hybrid Recommendation (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masataka Goto, Kosetsu Tsukuda</p>
    <p>In recommender systems, item diversification and explainable recommendations improve users’ satisfaction. Unlike traditional explainable recommendations that display a single explanation for each item, explainable hybrid recommendations display multiple explanations for each item and are, therefore, more beneficial for users. When multiple explanations are displayed, one problem is that similar sets of explanation styles (ESs) such as user-based, item-based, and popularity-based may be displayed for similar items. Although item diversification has been studied well, the question of how to diversify the ESs remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a method for diversifying ESs and a framework, called DualDiv, that recommends items by diversifying both the items and the ESs. Our experimental results show that DualDiv can increase the diversity of the items and the ESs without largely reducing the recommendation accuracy. i>Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch</i</p>

    <h3>Eliciting Pairwise Preferences in Recommender Systems (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Ricci, Saikishore Kalloori, Rosella Gennari</p>
    <p>Preference data in the form of ratings or likes for items are widely used in many Recommender Systems (RSs). However, previous research has shown that even item comparisons, which generate pairwise preference data, can be used to model user preferences. Moreover, pairwise preferences can be effectively combined with ratings to compute recommendations. In such hybrid approaches, the RS requires to elicit from the user both types of preference data. In this work, we aim at identifying how and when to elicit pairwise preferences, i.e., when this form of user preference data is more meaningful for the user to express and more beneficial for the system. We conducted an online A/B test and compared a rating-only based system variant with another variant that allows the user to enter both types of preferences. Our results demonstrate that pairwise preferences are valuable and useful especially when the user is focusing on a specific type of items and by incorporating pairwise preferences, the system can generate better recommendations than a state of the art rating-only based solution. Additionally, our results indicate that there exists a dependency between the user’s personality and the perceived system usability and the satisfaction for the preference elicitation procedure, which varies if only ratings or a combination of ratings and pairwise preferences are elicited.</p>

    <h3>A Novel Graph-based Model for Hybrid Recommendations in Cold-start Scenarios (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesare Bernardis, Paolo Cremonesi, Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema</p>
    <p>Cold-start is a very common and still open problem in the Recommender Systems literature. Since cold start items do not have any interaction, collaborative algorithms are not applicable. One of the main strategies is to use pure or hybrid content-based approaches, which usually yield to lower recommendation quality than collaborative ones. Some techniques to optimize performance of this type of approaches have been studied in recent past. One of them is called feature weighting, which assigns to every feature a real value, called weight, that estimates its importance. Statistical techniques for feature weighting commonly used in Information Retrieval, like TF-IDF, have been adapted for Recommender Systems, but they often do not provide sufficient quality improvements. More recent approaches, FBSM and LFW, estimate weights by leveraging collaborative information via machine learning, in order to learn the importance of a feature based on other users opinions. This type of models have shown promising results compared to classic statistical analyzes cited previously. We propose a novel graph, feature-based machine learning model to face the cold-start item scenario, learning the relevance of features from probabilities of item-based collaborative filtering algorithms.</p>

    <h3>User Preferences for Hybrid Explanations (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John O’Donovan, James Schaffer, Lise Getoor, Jay Pujara, Pigi Kouki</p>
    <p>Hybrid recommender systems combine several different sources of information to generate recommendations.  These systems have been shown to improve accuracy compared to single-source recommendation strategies.  However, hybrid recommendation strategies are inherently more complex than those that use a single source of information, and thus the process of explaining recommendations to consumers becomes more challenging. In this paper we show how to use a hybrid recommender system built on a probabilistic programming language to create hybrid recommendations.  We then describe an investigation into user preferences for explanations in this system. We present results of an online user survey that evaluates explanations for hybrid algorithms in a variety of text and visual, graph-based formats.</p>
