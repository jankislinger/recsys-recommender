    <h3>Question Recommendation with Constraints for Massive Open Online Courses (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Adamson, Diyi Yang, Carolyn Rose</p>
    <p>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have experienced a recent boom in interest. Although the number of students that have registered for MOOCs is remarkably high, the fraction of those who actively participate in course discussion forums is startlingly low. By recommending relevant forum discussions and questions to students, their engagement and participation may increase, to the benefit of both the student and the course community. This problem has not been thoroughly explored by existing recommender systems. In contrast to traditional product recommendation, question recommendation in discussion forums should consider constraints on both students and questions. These considerations include (1)Load Balancing – students should not be over-burdened with too many requests; and (2) Expertise Matching – matching students’ abilities to the difficulty of unanswered questions, which in turn positions students to contribute meaningfully to the forum. In this work, we propose a novel constrained question recommendation problem to address the above considerations, with the intent to improve the learning experience for course participants. We first design a context-aware matrix factorization model to predict students’ preferences over questions, then build a max cost flow model to address the constraints. Experimental results on three MOOC datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods in optimizing overall forum welfare, and in predicting which questions students might be interested in.</p>
