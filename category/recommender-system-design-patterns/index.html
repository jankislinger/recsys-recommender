    <h3>Building and Deploying a Multi-Stage Recommender System with Merlin (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Even Oldridge, Ronay Ak, Gabriel de Souza Pereira Moreira, Sara Rabhi, Karl Higley</p>
    <p>Newcomers to recommender systems often face challenges related to their lack of understanding of how these systems operate in real life. In most online content related to this topic, the focus is on models and algorithms that score items based on the user’s preferences. However, the recommender model alone does not comprise everything needed for serving optimized recommender systems that meet the company’s business objectives. An industry-standard recommender system involves a number of steps, including data preprocessing, defining and training recommender models, as well as filtering and business logic for serving. In this work, we propose the four-stage recommender system, an industry-wide design pattern we have identified for production recommender systems. The four-stage pipeline includes an item retrieval step that prepares a small subset of relevant items for scoring. The filtering stage then cleans up the subset of items based on business logic such as removing out-of-stock or previously seen items. As for the ranking component, it uses a recommender model to score each item in the presented list based on the preferences of the user. In the final step, the scores are re-ordered to provide a final recommendation list aligned with other business needs or constraints such as diversity. In particular, the presented demo demonstrates how easy it is to build and deploy a four-stage recommender system pipeline using the NVIDIA Merlin open-source framework.</p>
