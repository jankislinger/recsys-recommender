    <h3>Right Tool, Right Job: Recommendation for Repeat and Exploration Consumption in Food Delivery (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayu Li, Aixin Sun, Min Zhang, Weizhi Ma, Peijie Sun</p>
    <p>From e-commerce to music and news, recommender systems are tailored to specific scenarios. While researching generic models applicable to various scenarios is crucial, studying recommendations based on the unique characteristics of a specific and vital scenario holds both research and, more importantly, practical value. In this paper, we focus on store recommendations in the food delivery scenario, which is an intriguing and significant domain with unique behavior patterns and influential factors. First, we offer an in-depth analysis of real-world food delivery data across platforms and countries, revealing that (i) repeat and exploration orders are both noticeable behaviors and (ii) the influences of historical and collaborative situations on repeat and exploration consumption are distinct. Second, based on the observations, we separately design two simple yet effective recommendation models: <i>RepRec</i> for repeat orders and <i>ExpRec</i> for exploration ones. An ensemble module is further proposed to combine recommendations from two models for a unified recommendation list. Finally, experiments are conducted on three datasets spanning three countries across two food delivery platforms. Results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed recommenders on repeat, exploration, and combined recommendation tasks over various baselines. Such simple yet effective approaches will be beneficial for real applications. This work shows that dedicated analyses and methods for domain-specific characteristics are essential for the recommender system studies.</p>

    <h3>Is ChatGPT Fair for Recommendation? Evaluating Fairness in Large Language Model Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jizhi Zhang, Yang Zhang, Keqin Bao, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, Xiangnan He</p>
    <p>The resounding triumph of the Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in a novel LLM for recommendation (LLM4rec) paradigm. Notwithstanding, the capacity of LLM4rec to provide equitable recommendations remains uncharted due to the potential presence of societal prejudices in LLMs. In order to avert the plausible hazard of employing LLM4rec, we scrutinize the fairness of LLM4rec with respect to the users’ sensitive attributes. Owing to the disparity between LLM4rec and the conventional recommendation paradigm, there are challenges in utilizing the conventional recommendation fairness benchmark directly. To explore the fairness of recommendations under the LLM4rec, we propose a new benchmark Fairness in Large language models for Recommendation (FairLR), which consists of carefully designed metrics and a dataset that considers eight sensitive attributes in two recommendation scenarios: music and movie. We utilize our FairLR benchmark to examine ChatGPT and expose that it still demonstrates bias towards certain sensitive attributes while making recommendations. Our code and dataset can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FairLR-751D/.</p>

    <h3>Sustainability at Scale: Bridging the Intention-Behavior Gap with Sustainable Recommendations (2018)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lise Getoor, Ben London, Steven Isley, Sabina Tomkins</p>
    <p>We present an approach for jointly discovering sustainable products and sustainability-minded customers while making recommendations informed by these discoveries. Identifying sustainable products, and the customers who are interested in purchasing them, can improve customer satisfaction while also having a potentially large positive environmental impact. Finding sustainable products and evaluating their claims is a significant barrier facing sustainability-minded customers. Tools that reduce both these burdens are likely to boost the sale of sustainable products. However, it is difficult to determine the sustainability characteristics of these products — there are a variety of certifications and definitions of sustainability, and quality labeling requires input from domain experts. In this paper, we propose a flexible probabilistic framework that uses domain knowledge to identify sustainable products and customers, and uses these labels to predict customer purchases. We evaluate our approach on grocery items from the Amazon catalog. Our proposed approach outperforms established recommender system models in predicting future purchases while jointly inferring sustainability scores for customers and products.</p>

    <h3>Defining and Supporting Narrative-driven Recommendation (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marijn Koolen, Toine Bogers</p>
    <p>Research into recommendation algorithms has made great strides in recent years. However, these algorithms are typically applied in relatively straightforward scenarios: given information about a user’s past preferences, what will they like in the future? Recommendation is often more complex, however: evaluating recommended items never takes place in a vacuum, and it is often a single step in the user’s more complex background task. In this paper, we define a specific type of recommendation scenario called narrative-driven recommendation, where the recommendation process is driven by both a log of the user’s past transactions as well as a narrative description of their current interest(s). Through an analysis of a set of real-world recommendation narratives from the LibraryThing forums, we demonstrate the uniqueness and richness of this  scenario and highlight common patterns and properties of such narratives.</p>

    <h3>Chemical Reactant Recommendation using a Network of Organic Chemistry (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ernesto Diaz-Aviles, Carlos Alzate, Akihiro Kishimoto, John Savage, Beat Buesser</p>
    <p>This paper presents recommendation algorithms for novel applications in chemistry. We focus on the task of recommending to the chemist candidate molecules (reactants) necessary to synthesize a given target molecule (product), which is an important step for the chemist to find a synthesis route to generate the product. We formulate this task as a link-prediction problem over a so-called Network of Organic Chemistry (NOC) that we have constructed from 8 million chemical reactions described in the US patent literature between 1976 and 2013. We leverage state-of-the-art factorization algorithms for recommender systems to solve this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Factorization Machines, trained with chemistry-specific knowledge, outperforms current methods based on similarity of chemical structures.</p>

    <h3>Risk-Hedged Venture Capital Investment Recommendation (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Wang, Xiaoxue Zhao, Weinan Zhang</p>
    <p>With the increasing accessibility of transactional data in venture finance, venture capital (VC) firms face great challenges in developing quantitative tools to identify new investment opportunities. Recommendation techniques have the possibility of helping VCs making data-driven investment decisions by providing an automatic screening process of the large number of startups across different domains on the basis of their past investment data. A previous study has shown the potential advantage of using collaborative filtering to catch and predict the VCs’ investment behaviours. However, two fundamental challenges in venture finance make conventional recommendation techniques difficult to apply. First, risk factors should be cautiously considered when making investments: for a potential startup, a VC needs to specifically estimate how well this new investment can fit into its investment portfolio in such a way that investment risk can be . Second, The investment behaviours are much sparser than conventional recommendation applications and a VC’s investments are usually limited to a few industry categories, making it impossible to use a topic-diversification method to hedge the risk. In this paper, we solve the startup recommendation problem from a risk management perspective. We propose 5 risk-aware startup selection and ranking algorithms to catch the VCs’ investment behaviours and predict their new investments. Apart from the contribution on the new risk-aware recommendation model, our experiments on the collected CrunchBase dataset show significant performance improvements over strong baselines.</p>

    <h3>Task-Based User Modelling for Personalization via Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (2014)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Mehrotra, Emine Yilmaz, Manisha Verma</p>
    <p>We introduce a novel approach to user modelling for behavioral targeting: task-based user representation and present an approach based on search task extraction from search logs wherein users are represented by their actions over a task-space. Given a web search log, we extract search tasks performed by users and nd user representations based on these tasks. More specically, we construct a user-task association matrix and borrow insights from Collaborative Filtering to learn low-dimensional factor model wherein the interests/preferences of a user are determined by a small number of latent factors. We compare the performance of the proposed approach on the task of collaborative query recommendation on publicly available AOL search log with a standard term-similarity baseline and discuss potential future research directions.</p>
