    <h3>Alleviating the Long-Tail Problem in Conversational Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Cao, Kun Zhou, Fan Pan, Zhipeng Zhao, Xiaolei Wang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
    <p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) aim to provide the recommendation service via natural language conversations. To develop an effective CRS, high-quality CRS datasets are very crucial. However, existing CRS datasets suffer from the long-tail issue, \ie a large proportion of items are rarely (or even never) mentioned in the conversations, which are called long-tail items. As a result, the CRSs trained on these datasets tend to recommend frequent items,  and the diversity of the recommended items would be largely reduced, making users easier to get bored. To address this issue, this paper presents <b>LOT-CRS</b>, a novel framework that focuses on simulating and utilizing a balanced CRS dataset (\ie covering all the items evenly) for improving <b>LO</b>ng-<b>T</b>ail recommendation performance of CRSs. In our approach, we design two pre-training tasks to enhance the understanding of simulated conversation for long-tail items, and adopt retrieval-augmented fine-tuning with label smoothness strategy to further improve the recommendation of long-tail items. Extensive experiments on two public CRS datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and extensibility of our approach, especially on long-tail recommendation. All the experimental codes will be released after the review period.</p>

    <h3>EasyStudy: Framework for Easy Deployment of User Studies on Recommender Systems (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ladislav Peska, Patrik Dokoupil</p>
    <p>Improvements in the recommender systems (RS) domain are not possible without a thorough way to evaluate and compare newly proposed approaches. User studies represent a viable alternative to online and offline evaluation schemes, but despite their numerous benefits, they are only rarely used. One of the main reasons behind this fact is that preparing a user study from scratch involves a lot of extra work on top of a simple algorithm proposal.  To simplify this task, we propose \textsc{EasyStudy}, a modular framework built on the credo “<i>Make simple things fast and hard things possible</i>”. It features ready-to-use datasets, preference elicitation methods, incrementally tuned baseline algorithms, study flow plugins, and evaluation metrics. As a result, a simple study comparing several RS can be deployed with just a few clicks, while more complex study designs can still benefit from a range of reusable components, such as preference elicitation. Overall, \textsc{EasyStudy} dramatically decreases the gap between the laboriousness of offline evaluation vs. user studies and, therefore, may contribute towards the more reliable and insightful user-centric evaluation of next-generation RS.</p>

    <h3>Identifying New Podcasts with High General Appeal Using a Pure Exploration Infinitely-Armed Bandit Strategy (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugues Bouchard, Javed Aslam, Kevin Jamieson, Maryam Aziz, Alice Y. Wang, Jesse Anderton</p>
    <p>Podcasting is an increasingly popular medium for entertainment and discourse around the world, with tens of thousands of new podcasts released on a monthly basis. We consider the problem of identifying from these newly-released podcasts those with the largest potential audiences so they can be considered for personalized recommendation to users. We first study and then discard a supervised approach due to the inadequacy of either content or consumption features for this task, and instead propose a novel non-contextual bandit algorithm in the fixed-budget infinitely-armed pure-exploration setting. We demonstrate that our algorithm is well-suited to the best-arm identification task for a broad class of arm reservoir distributions, out-competing a large number of state-of-the-art algorithms. We then apply the algorithm to identifying podcasts with broad appeal in a simulated study, and show that it efficiently sorts podcasts into groups by increasing appeal while avoiding the popularity bias inherent in supervised approaches.</p>

    <h3>Translating the Public Service Media Remit into Metrics and Algorithms (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Grün, Xenija Neufeld</p>
    <p>After multiple years of providing automated video recommendations in the ZDFmediathek, ZDF has established a solid ground for the usage of recommender systems. Being a Public Service Media (PSM) provider, our most important driver on this journey is our Public Service Media Remit (PSMR). We are committed to cultivate PSM values such as diversity, fairness, and transparency while providing fresh and relevant content. Therefore, it is important for us to not only measure the success of our recommender systems in terms of basic business Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as clicks and viewing minutes but also to ensure and to measure the achievement of PSM values. While speaking about PSM values, however, it is important to keep in mind that there is no easy way to directly measure values as such. In order to be able to measure their extent in a recommender system, we need to translate these values into public value metrics. However, not only the final results are essential for the PSMR. Additionally, it is highly important to establish transparency while working towards these results, that is, while defining the data, the algorithms, and the pipelines used in recommender systems. In our talk we will provide a deeper insight into how we approach this task with Model Cards and give an overview of some models, their Model Cards, and metrics that we are currently using for ZDFmediathek.</p>

    <h3>Recommending Personalised News in Short User Sessions (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sahin Albayrak, Rebecca Deneckere, Jon Espen Ingvaldsen, Camille Salinesi, Benjamin Kille, Elena Viorica Epure</p>
    <p>News organizations employ personalized recommenders to target news articles to specific readers and thus foster engagement. Existing approaches rely on extensive user profiles. However, though often available, authentication is a rare choice of readers consulting news publishers’ websites. This paper proposes an approach for such cases. It provides a basic degree of personalization while complying with the key characteristics of news recommendation including news popularity, recency and the dynamics of reading behavior. We extent existing research on the dynamics of news reading behavior by focusing not only on the progress of reading interests over time but also on their relations. Reading interests are considered in three categories: short, medium and long-term. Combinations of these are evaluated in terms of added value to the recommendation’s performance and ensured news variety. The experiments with 17-month data logs from a German news publisher show that most frequent relations between news reading interests are constant in time but their probabilities change. Also, recommendations based on short-term with long-term interests result in increased accuracy while recommendations based on short-term with medium-term interests yield a higher news variety.</p>

    <h3>How Diverse Is Your Audience? Exploring Consumer Diversity in Recommender Systems (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacek Wasilewski, Neil Hurley</p>
    <p>On-line recommender systems have different challenges to overcome to provide content to users. One of these is the potential of isolating users from a diverse set of items by recommending very narrow content. In this paper we propose an item-centric view of a recommender system, looking at the exposure of items to groups of consumers, and how diverse those groups are, to identify if items are recommended to narrower groups of consumers. This is opposite to current practice where diversity of content is typically analysed. Preliminary results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that recommender systems expose items to narrower groups of consumers, and these groups are less diverse.</p>

    <h3>Exploiting Socio-Economic Models for Lodging Recommendation in the Sharing Economy (2017)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrygo L.T. Santos, Raul Sanchez-Vazquez, Jordan Silva</p>
    <p>Recent years have witnessed the emergence of sharing economy marketplaces, which enable users to share goods and services in a peer-to-peer fashion. A prominent example in the travel industry is Airbnb, which connects guests with hosts, allowing both to exchange cultural experiences in addition to the economic transaction. Nonetheless, Airbnb guest profiles are typically sparse, which limits the applicability of traditional lodging recommendation approaches. Inspired by recent socio-economic analyses of repurchase intent behavior on Airbnb, we propose a context-aware learning-to-rank approach for lodging recommendation, aimed to infer the user’s perception of several dimensions involved in choosing which lodging to book. In particular, we devise features aimed to capture the user’s price sensitivity as well as their perceived value of a particular lodging, the risk involved in choosing it rather than other available options, the authenticity of the cultural experience it could provide, and its overall perception by other users through word of mouth. Through a comprehensive evaluation using publicly available Airbnb data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to a number of alternative recommendation baselines, including a simulation of Airbnb’s own recommender.</p>

    <h3>‘Please, Not Now!’ A Model for Timing Recommendations (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lior Rokach, Bracha Shapira, Nofar Dali Betzalel</p>
    <p>Proactive recommender systems push recommendations to users without their explicit request whenever a recommendation that suits a user is available. These systems strive to optimize the match between recommended items and users’ preferences. We assume that recommendations might be reflected with low accuracy not only due to the recommended items’ suitability to the user, but also because of the recommendations’ timings. We therefore claim that it is possible to learn a model of good and bad contexts for recommendations that can later be integrated in a recommender system. Using mobile data collected during a three weeks user study we suggest a two-phase model that is able to classify whether a certain context is at all suitable for any recommendation, regardless of its content. Results reveal that a hybrid model that first decides whether it should use a personal or a non-personal timing model, and then classifies accordingly whether the timing is proper for recommendations, is superior to both the personal or non-personal timing models.</p>
