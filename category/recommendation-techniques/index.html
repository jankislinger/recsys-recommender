    <h3>Unleash the Power of Context: Enhancing Large-Scale Recommender Systems with Context-Based Prediction Models (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davorin Kopič, Jan Hartman, Assaf Klein, Natalia Silberstein</p>
    <p>In this work, we introduce the notion of Context-Based Prediction Models. A Context-Based Prediction Model determines the probability of a user’s action (such as a click or a conversion) solely by relying on user and contextual features, without considering any specific features of the item itself. We have identified numerous valuable applications for this modeling approach, including training an auxiliary context-based model to estimate click probability and incorporating its prediction as a feature in CTR prediction models.Our experiments indicate that this enhancement brings significant improvements in offline and online business metrics while having minimal impact on the cost of serving. Overall, our work offers a simple and scalable, yet powerful approach for enhancing the performance of large-scale commercial recommender systems, with broad implications for the field of personalized recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Content-based book recommendations (2021)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niels Bogaards</p>
    <p>The content-based book recommendation approach developed by Bookarang yields many improvements over existing systems, not only in recommendation quality and consistency, but also in flexibility, depth and transparency. Content-based book recommenders can be implemented in a large array of products, from personalised newsletters to conversational AI systems.</p>

    <h3>Using Conceptual Incongruity as a Basis for Making Recommendations (2020)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nisheeth Srivastava, Tushar Shandhilya</p>
    <p>We evaluate the possibility of using within-item measures of meta-data similarity to improve recommendation rankings along psychologically salient dimensions of incongruity and creativity. Our approach contrasts with recently developed methods at introducing diversity into recommendations which rely on across-item measurements of dissimilarity, while sharing several formal and algorithmic elements. We show that semantic distance based operationalizations of psychological constructs show substantial correlation with empirical data. We further show that incongruity predicts variability in satisfaction as measured by movie ratings in a large corpus. Empirical results from a two month-long user study demonstrate that incongruity-based recommendations attract considerably more interaction from users, and users expressed significantly greater satisfaction given these recommendations. Based on these observations, we propose that using incongruity to diversify recommendations may be useful in expanding recommendation repertoires along interesting psychological dimensions, complementing relevance-based search.</p>

    <h3>Personalized Recommendations using Knowledge Graphs: A Probabilistic Logic Programming Approach (2016)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William Cohen, Rose Catherine</p>
    <p>Improving the performance of recommender systems using knowledge graphs is an important task. There have been many hybrid systems proposed in the past that use a mix of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to boost the performance. More recently, some work has focused on recommendations that use external knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement content-based recommendation. In this paper, we investigate three methods for making KG based recommendations using a general-purpose probabilistic logic system called ProPPR. The simplest of the models, EntitySim, uses only the links of the graph. We then extend the model to TypeSim that also uses the types of the entities to boost its generalization capabilities. Next, we develop a graph based latent factor model, GraphLF, which combines the strengths of latent factorization with graphs. We compare our approaches to a recently proposed state-of-the-art graph recommendation method on two large datasets, Yelp and MovieLens-100K. The experiments illustrate that our approaches can give large performance improvements. Additionally, we demonstrate that knowledge graphs give maximum advantage when the dataset is sparse, and gradually become redundant as more training data becomes available, and hence are most useful in cold-start settings.</p>

    <h3>POI Recommendation: Towards Fused Matrix Factorization with Geographical and Temporal Influences (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Talel Abdessalem, Jean-Benoît Griesner, Hubert Naacke</p>
    <p>Providing personalized point-of-interest (POI) recommendation has become a major issue with the rapid emergence of location-based social networks (LBSNs). Unlike traditional recommendation approaches, the LBSNs application domain comes with significant geographical and temporal dimensions. Moreover most of traditional recommendation algorithms fail to cope with the specific challenges implied by these two dimensions. Fusing geographical and temporal influences for better recommendation accuracy in LBSNs remains unexplored, as far as we know. We depict how matrix factorization can serve POI recommendation, and propose a novel attempt to integrate both geographical and temporal influences into matrix factorization. Specifically we present GeoMF-TD, an extension of geographical matrix factorization with temporal dependencies. Our experiments on a real dataset shows up to 20% benefit on recommendation precision.</p>
