    <h3>Revisiting BPR: A Replicability Study of a Common Recommender System Baseline (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandr Milogradskii, Oleg Lashinin, Sergey Kolesnikov, Alexander P, Marina Ananyeva</p>
    <p>Bayesian Personalized Rank (BPR), a collaborative filtering approach based on matrix factorization, frequently serves as a benchmark for recommender systems research. However, numerous studies often overlook the nuances of BPR implementation, claiming that it performs worse than newly proposed methods across various tasks. In this paper, we thoroughly examine the features of the BPR model, indicating their impact on its performance, and investigate open-source BPR implementations. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies between these implementations and the original BPR paper, leading to a significant decrease in performance of up to 50% for specific implementations. Furthermore, through extensive experiments on real-world datasets under modern evaluation settings, we demonstrate that with proper tuning of its hyperparameters, the BPR model can achieve performance levels close to state-of-the-art methods on the top-n recommendation tasks and even outperform them on specific datasets. Specifically, on the Million Song Dataset, the BPR model with hyperparameters tuning statistically significantly outperforms Mult-VAE by 10% in NDCG@100 with binary relevance function.</p>

    <h3>Towards Open-World Recommendation with Knowledge Augmentation from Large Language Models (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiwen Liu, Bo Chen, Yong Yu, Hong Zhu, Yunjia Xi, Weinan Zhang, Jianghao Lin, Xiaoling Cai, Jieming Zhu, Ruiming Tang</p>
    <p>Recommender system plays a vital role in various online services. However, its insulated nature of training and deploying separately within a specific closed domain limits its access to open-world knowledge. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in bridging this gap by encoding extensive world knowledge and demonstrating reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, previous attempts to directly use LLMs as recommenders cannot meet the inference latency demand of industrial recommender systems. In this work, we propose an Open-World Knowledge Augmented Recommendation Framework with Large Language Models, dubbed KAR, to acquire two types of external knowledge from LLMs — the reasoning knowledge on user preferences and the factual knowledge on items. We introduce factorization prompting to elicit accurate reasoning on user preferences. The generated reasoning and factual knowledge are effectively transformed and condensed into augmented vectors by a hybrid-expert adaptor in order to be compatible with the recommendation task. The obtained vectors can then be directly used to enhance the performance of any recommendation model. We also ensure efficient inference by preprocessing and prestoring the knowledge from the LLM. Extensive experiments show that KAR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and is compatible with a wide range of recommendation algorithms. We deploy KAR to Huawei’s news and music recommendation platforms and gain a 7% and 1.7% improvement in the online A/B test, respectively.</p>

    <h3>SeCor: Aligning Semantic and Collaborative representations by Large Language Models for Next-Point-of-Interest Recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling Ding, Yang Xiang, Jianting Chen, Shirui Wang, Xiaoying Gao, Bohan Xie</p>
    <p>The widespread adoption of location-based applications has created a growing demand for point-of-interest (POI) recommendation, which aims to predict a user’s next POI based on their historical check-in data and current location. However, existing methods often struggle to capture the intricate relationships within check-in data. This is largely due to their limitations in representing temporal and spatial information and underutilizing rich semantic features. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful semantic comprehension to solve them, they are limited by hallucination and the inability to incorporate global collaborative information. To address these issues, we propose a novel method SeCor, which treats POI recommendation as a multi-modal task and integrates semantic and collaborative representations to form an efficient hybrid encoding. SeCor first employs a basic collaborative filtering model to mine interaction features. These embeddings, as one modal information, are fed into LLM to align with semantic representation, leading to efficient hybrid embeddings. To mitigate the hallucination, SeCor recommends based on the hybrid embeddings rather than directly using the LLM’s output text. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that SeCor outperforms all baselines, achieving improved recommendation performance by effectively integrating collaborative and semantic information through LLMs.</p>

    <h3>Prompt Tuning for Item Cold-start Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingchi Wang, Gaode Chen, Qi Zhang, Jingjian Lin, Yuezihan Jiang, Kaigui Bian, Wenhan Zhang, Peng Jiang, Yinjie Jiang</p>
    <p>The item cold-start problem is crucial for online recommender systems, as the success of the cold-start phase determines whether items can transition into popular ones. Prompt learning, a powerful technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to address zero- or few-shot problems, has been adapted for recommender systems to tackle similar challenges. However, existing methods typically rely on content-based properties or text descriptions for prompting, which we argue may be suboptimal for cold-start recommendations due to 1) semantic gaps with recommender tasks, 2) model bias caused by warm-up items contribute most of positive feedback to the model, which is the core of the cold-start problem that hinder the recommender quality on cold-start items. We propose to leverage high-value positive feedback, termed pinnacle feedback as prompt information, to simultaneously resolve the above two problems. We experimentally prove that comparing to content description proposed in existing works, the positive feedback is more suitable to serve as prompt information by bridging the semantic gaps. Besides, we propose item-wise personalized prompt networks to encode pinnaclce feedback to relieve the model bias by the positive feedback dominance problem. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, PROMO has been successfully deployed on a popular short-video sharing platform, a billion-user scale commercial short-video application, achieving remarkable performance gains across various commercial metrics within cold-start scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Positive-Sum Impact of Multistakeholder Recommender Systems for Urban Tourism Promotion and User Utility (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Ricci, Pavel Merinov</p>
    <p>We explore how multistakeholder recommender systems (MRSs) can impact urban tourism promotion. Usually, two conflicting goals are of interest: (i) to cut down the number of visitors at popular sites and (ii) to satisfy individual tourist preferences, often biased towards popular sites. By leveraging users’ limited knowledge of the sites catalogue, we model and simulate interactions between tourists and an MRS that jointly optimises user utility and promotes less popular sites. Experiments based on data logs collected in tourist cities reveal that an MRS can lift user utility and at the same time reduce the number of visitors at popular sites, manifesting the so-called positive-sum impact. However, a delicate balance is crucial; under- or over-promotion of unpopular sites in recommendation lists can be adverse to both destination and user utilities.</p>

    <h3>Bias in Book Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Savvina Daniil</p>
    <p>Recommender systems are prevalent in many applications, but hide risks; issues like bias propagation have been on the focus of related studies in recent years. My own research revolves around tracking bias in the book recommendation domain. Specifically, I am interested in whether the incorporation of recommender systems in a library’s loaning system serves their social responsibility and purpose, with bias being the main point of concern. To this end, I engage with the topic in three ways; by mapping the area of ethics in book recommendation, by investigating and reflecting on challenges with studying bias in recommender systems in general, and by showcasing a set of social implication of statistical bias in the book recommendation domain in particular. In this doctoral symposium paper, I further elaborate on the problem at hand, the outline of my thesis, the progress I have made so far, as well as my plans for future work along with specific questions that have arisen from my research efforts.</p>

    <h3>Accelerating the Surrogate Retraining for Poisoning Attacks against Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunfan Wu, Shuchang Tao, Qi Cao, Huawei Shen, Fei Sun, Kaike Zhang</p>
    <p>Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of recommender systems to data poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject carefully crafted fake user interactions into the training data to manipulate recommendations for target items.Current attack methods involve iterative retraining a surrogate recommender on the poisoned data with latest fake users to optimize the attack. However, this repetitive retraining is highly time-consuming, hindering the efficient assessment and optimization of fake users. To mitigate this computational bottleneck and develop a more effective attack in an affordable time, we analyze the retraining process and find that a change in the representation of one user/item will cause a cascading effect through the user-item interaction graph. Under theoretical guidance, we introduce Gradient Passing (GP),  a novel technique that explicitly passes gradients between interacted user-item pairs during backpropagation, thereby approximate the cascading effect and accelerating retraining. With just a single training step, GP can achieve effects comparable to multiple original steps. Under the same number of retraining epochs, GP enables a closer approximation of the surrogate recommender to the victim. This improved approximation provides better guidance for optimizing fake users, ultimately leading to enhanced data poisoning attacks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed GP.</p>

    <h3>Fairness Matters: A look at LLM-generated group recommendations (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonela Tommasel</p>
    <p>Recommender systems play a crucial role in how users consume information, with group recommendation receiving considerable attention. Ensuring fairness in group recommender systems entails providing recommendations that are useful and relevant to all group members rather than solely reflecting the majority’s preferences, while also addressing fairness concerns related to sensitive attributes (e.g., gender). Recently, the advancements on Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of new kinds of recommender systems. However, LLMs can perpetuate social biases present in training data, posing risks of unfair outcomes and harmful impacts. We investigated LLMs impact on group recommendation fairness, establishing and instantiating a framework that encompasses group definition, sensitive attribute combinations, and evaluation methodology. Our findings revealed the interactions patterns between sensitive attributes and LLMs and how they affected recommendation. This study advances the understanding of fairness considerations in group recommendation systems, laying the groundwork for future research.</p>

    <h3>Optimal Baseline Corrections for Off-Policy Contextual Bandits (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shashank Gupta, Olivier Jeunen, Maarten de Rijke, Harrie Oosterhuis</p>
    <p>The off-policy learning paradigm allows for recommender systems and general ranking applications to be framed as decision-making problems, where we aim to learn decision policies that optimize an unbiased offline estimate of an online reward metric. With unbiasedness comes potentially high variance, and prevalent methods exist to reduce estimation variance. These methods typically make use of control variates, either additive (i.e., baseline corrections or doubly robust methods) or multiplicative (i.e., self-normalisation). Our work unifies these approaches by proposing a single framework built on their equivalence in learning scenarios. The foundation of our framework is the derivation of an equivalent baseline correction for all of the existing control variates. Consequently, our framework enables us to characterize the variance-optimal unbiased estimator and provide a closed-form solution for it. This optimal estimator brings significantly improved performance in both evaluation and learning, and minimizes data requirements. Empirical observations corroborate our theoretical findings.</p>

    <h3>Multi-Behavioral Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shereen Elsayed, Lars Schmidt-Thieme, Ahmed Rashed</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation models are crucial for next-item prediction tasks in various online platforms, yet many focus on a single behavior, neglecting valuable implicit interactions. While multi-behavioral models address this using graph-based approaches, they often fail to capture sequential patterns simultaneously. Our proposed Multi-Behavioral Sequential Recommendation framework (MBSRec) captures the multi-behavior dependencies between the heterogeneous historical interactions via multi-head self-attention. Furthermore, we utilize a weighted binary cross-entropy loss for precise behavior control. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate MBSRec’s significant outperformance of state-of-the-art approaches. The implementation code is available here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EGRQutc9xtVYbsbXswUcTb9nvT1Tc9cZ?usp=sharing) during the review and will be added to GitHub upon acceptance.</p>

    <h3>Understanding Fairness in Recommender Systems: A Healthcare Perspective (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veronica Kecki, Alan Said</p>
    <p>Fairness in AI-driven decision-making systems has become a critical concern, especially when these systems directly affect human lives. This paper explores the public’s comprehension of fairness in healthcare recommendations. We conducted a survey where participants selected from four fairness metrics – Demographic Parity, Equal Accuracy, Equalized Odds, and Positive Predictive Value – across different healthcare scenarios to assess their understanding of these concepts. Our findings reveal that fairness is a complex and often misunderstood concept, with a generally low level of public understanding regarding fairness metrics in recommender systems. This study highlights the need for enhanced information and education on algorithmic fairness to support informed decision-making in using these systems. Furthermore, the results suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach to fairness may be insufficient, pointing to the importance of context-sensitive designs in developing equitable AI systems.</p>

    <h3>ReLand: Integrating Large Language Models’ Insights into Industrial Recommenders via a Controllable Reasoning Pool (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyu Chen, Changxin Tian, Jiawei Chen, Jun Zhou, Ziqi Liu, Li Yu, Chunjing Gan, Zhuo Zhang, Binbin Hu, Zhiqiang Zhang</p>
    <p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in addressing the isolation issues faced by recommender systems. However, despite performance comparable to traditional recommenders, the current methods are cost-prohibitive for industrial applications. Consequently, existing LLM-based methods still need to catch up regarding effectiveness and efficiency. To tackle the above challenges, we present an LLM-enhanced recommendation framework named ReLand, which leverages Retrieval to effortlessly integrate Large language models’ insights into industrial recommenders. Specifically, ReLand employs LLMs to perform generative recommendations on sampled users (a.k.a., seed users), thereby constructing an LLM Reasoning Pool. Subsequently, we leverage retrieval to attach reliable recommendation rationales for the entire user base, ultimately effectively improving recommendation performance. Extensive offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of ReLand. Since January 2024, ReLand has been deployed in the recommender system of Alipay, achieving statistically significant improvements of 3.19% in CTR and 1.08% in CVR.</p>

    <h3>A Dataset for Adapting Recommender Systems to the Fashion Rental Economy (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jivitesh Sharma, Karl Audun Borgersen, Morten Goodwin, Morten Grundetjern</p>
    <p>In response to the escalating ecological challenges that threaten global sustainability, there’s a deep need to investigate alternative methods of commerce, such as rental economies. Like most online commerce, rental or otherwise, a functioning recommender system is crucial for their success. Yet the domain has, until this point, been largely neglected by the recommender system research community. Our dataset, derived from our collaboration with the leading Norwegian fashion rental company [Company name omitted for review process], encompasses 64k transactions, rental histories from 2.2k anonymized users, and 15.8k unique outfits in which each physical item’s attributes and rental history is meticulously tracked. All outfits are listed as individual items or their corresponding item groups, referring to shared designs between the individual items. This approach underlines the novel challenges of rental as compared to more traditional recommender system problems where items are generally interchangeable. Each outfit is accompanied by a set of tags describing some of their attributes. We also provide a total of 50k images displaying across all items along with a set of precomputed zero-shot embeddings. We apply a myriad of common recommender system methods to the dataset to provide a performance baseline. This baseline is performed for the traditional fashion recommender system problem of recommending outfit groups and the novel problem of predicting individual item rental. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset discussing the domain of clothes rental. It is our hope that the publication of this dataset will serve as a catalyst for a new branch of research for specialized fashion rental recommender systems. The dataset is temporarily hosted at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/clothes_rental_dataset-B1E8/ and Google Cloud at https: //console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/clothes-rental-dataset The code for collecting, processing, and evaluating the dataset is hosted at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Vibrent_Dataset_Collection-03DC/</p>

    <h3>DNS-Rec: Data-aware Neural Architecture Search for Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Zhang, Xiangyu Zhao, Ruocheng Guo, Sheng Zhang, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu, Yao Zhao, Hongzhi Yin, Maolin Wang</p>
    <p>In the era of data proliferation, efficiently sifting through vast information to extract meaningful insights has become increasingly crucial. This paper addresses the computational and resource inefficiencies prevalent in existing Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs). However, existing SRSs are often plagued by significant computational overhead and resource inefficiency during the inference stage. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative approach combining pruning methods with advanced model designs. Furthermore, we delve into resource-constrained Neural Architecture Search (NAS), an emerging technique in recommender systems, to optimize models in terms of FLOPs, latency, and energy consumption while maintaining or enhancing accuracy. Our principal contribution is the development of a Data-aware Neural Architecture Search for Recommender System (DNS-Rec). DNS-Rec is specifically designed to tailor compact network architectures for attention-based SRS models, thereby ensuring accuracy retention. It incorporates data-aware gates to enhance the performance of the recommendation network by learning information from historical user-item interactions. Moreover, DNS-Rec employs a dynamic resource constraint strategy, stabilizing the search process and yielding more suitable architectural solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through rigorous experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets, which highlight the superiority of DNS-Rec in SRSs. Our findings set a new standard for future research in efficient and accurate recommendation systems, marking a significant step forward in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

    <h3>Informed Dataset Selection with ‘Algorithm Performance Spaces’ (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lien Michiels, Lukas Wegmeth, Joeran Beel, Steffen Schulz</p>
    <p>When designing recommender-systems experiments, a key question that has been largely overlooked is the choice of datasets. In a brief survey of ACM RecSys papers, we found that authors typically justified their dataset choices by labelling them as public, benchmark, or ‘real-world’ without further explanation. We propose the Algorithm Performance Space (APS) as a novel method for informed dataset selection. The APS is an n-dimensional space where each dimension represents the performance of a different algorithm. Each dataset is depicted as an n-dimensional vector, with greater distances indicating higher diversity. In our experiment, we ran 29 algorithms on 95 datasets to construct an actual APS. Our findings show that many datasets, including most Amazon datasets, are clustered closely in the APS, i.e. they are not diverse. However, other datasets, such as MovieLens and Docear, are more dispersed. The APS also enables the grouping of datasets based on the solvability of the underlying problem. Datasets in the top right corner of the APS are considered ’solved problems’ because all algorithms perform well on them. Conversely, datasets in the bottom left corner lack well-performing algorithms, making them ideal candidates for new recommender-system research due to the challenges they present.</p>
