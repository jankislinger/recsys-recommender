    <h3>Exploring Coresets for Efficient Training and Consistent Evaluation of Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Ju, Neil Hurley, Honghui Du, Elias Tragos, Aonghus Lawlor</p>
    <p>Recommender systems have achieved remarkable success in various web applications, such as e-commerce, online advertising, and social media, harnessing the power of big data. To attain optimal model performance, recommender systems are typically trained on very large datasets, with substantial numbers of users and items. However, large datasets often present challenges in terms of processing time and computational resources. Coreset selection offers a method for obtaining a reduced yet representative subset from vast datasets, thereby enhancing the efficiency of training machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, little research has been conducted to explore the practical implications of different coreset selection approaches on the performance of recommender systems algorithms. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of various coreset selection techniques. We evaluate the performance of the resulting coresets using inductive recommendation models which allow for consistent evaluations to be performed. The experimental results demonstrate that coreset methods are a powerful and useful approach for obtaining reduced datasets which preserve the properties of the large original dataset and have competitive performance compared to the time required to train with the full dataset.</p>

    <h3>Cross-Domain Latent Factors Sharing via Implicit Matrix Factorization (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexey Vasilev, Anton Vakhrushev, Evgeny Frolov, Abdulaziz Samra, Alexander Grigorevskiy</p>
    <p>Data sparsity has been one of the long-standing problems for recommender systems. One of the solutions to mitigate this issue is to exploit knowledge available in other source domains. However, many cross-domain recommender systems introduce a complex architecture that makes them less scalable in practice. On the other hand, matrix factorization methods are still considered to be strong baselines for single-domain recommendations. In this paper, we introduce the CDIMF, a model that extends the standard implicit matrix factorization with ALS to cross-domain scenarios. We apply the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers to learn shared latent factors for overlapped users while factorizing the interaction matrix. In a dual-domain setting, experiments on industrial datasets demonstrate a competing performance of CDIMF for both cold-start and warm-start. The proposed model can outperform most other recent cross-domain and single-domain models.</p>

    <h3>What to compare? Towards understanding user sessions on price comparison platforms (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Neidhardt, Ahmadou Wagne</p>
    <p>E-commerce and online shopping have become integral to the lives of many, with various user behavior types historically identified. Beyond deciding what to buy, determining where to make a purchase has led to the importance of price comparison platforms. However, user behavior on these platforms remains underexplored. Furthermore, web analytics often struggle with tracking users over time and deriving meaningful user types from data. This paper addresses these gaps by defining session types through the analysis and clustering of user logs from a major price comparison platform. The study identifies six distinct session clusters: quick peek, major purchase, constraint-based browsing, knowledge seeking, search and browse and heavy browsing. These findings are intended to inform the design and development of a conversational recommender system (CRS). Often, CRS development occurs without adequate consideration of the existing system into which it will be integrated. The study’s findings, derived from both quantitative analysis and expert interviews, provide valuable contributions, including identified session clusters, their interpretation and indicators on which users might benefit from a CRS on these platforms.</p>

    <h3>Are We Explaining the Same Recommenders? Incorporating Recommender Performance for Evaluating Explainers (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Reza Mohammadi, Michael Müller, Eva Zangerle, Andreas Peintner</p>
    <p>Explainability in recommender systems is both crucial and challenging. Among the state-of-the-art explanation strategies, counterfactual explanation provides intuitive and easily understandable insights into model predictions by illustrating how a small change in the input can lead to a different outcome. Recently, this approach has garnered significant attention, with various studies employing different metrics to evaluate the performance of these explanation methods. In this paper, we investigate the metrics used for evaluating counterfactual explainers for recommender systems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the performance of recommenders has a direct effect on counterfactual explainers and ignoring it results in inconsistencies in the evaluation results of explainer methods. Our findings highlight an additional challenge in evaluating counterfactual explainer methods and underscore the need to report the recommender performance or consider it in evaluation metrics.</p>

    <h3>Exploratory Analysis of Recommending Urban Parks for Health-Promoting Activities (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Quercia, Sanja Šćepanović, Ke Zhou, Linus W. Dietz</p>
    <p>Parks are essential spaces for promoting urban health, and recommender systems could assist individuals in discovering parks for leisure and health-promoting activities. This is particularly important in large cities like London, which has over 1,500 named parks, making it challenging to understand what each park offers. Due to the lack of datasets and the diverse health-promoting activities parks can support (e.g., physical, social, nature-appreciation), it is unclear which recommendation algorithms are best suited for this task. To explore the dynamics of recommending parks for specific activities, we created two datasets: one from a survey of over 250 London residents, and another by inferring visits from over 1 million geotagged Flickr images taken in London parks. Analyzing the geographic patterns of these visits revealed that recommending nearby parks is ineffective, suggesting that this recommendation task is distinct from Point of Interest recommendation. We then tested various recommendation models, identifying a significant popularity bias in the results. Additionally, we found that personalized models have advantages in recommending parks beyond the most popular ones. The data and findings from this study provide a foundation for future research on park recommendations.</p>

    <h3>CEERS: Counterfactual Evaluations of Explanations in Recommender Systems (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikhail Baklanov</p>
    <p>The growing emphasis on explainability in ethical AI, driven by regulations like GDPR, underscores the need for robust explanations of Recommender Systems (RS). Key to the development and research progress of such methods are reproducible, quantifiable evaluation metrics. Traditional human-involved evaluation methods are not reproducible, subjective, costly, and fail to capture the counterfactual nuances of AI explanations. Hence, there is a pressing need for objective and scalable metrics to accurately measure the correctness of explanation methods for recommender systems. Inspired by similar approaches in computer vision, this research aims to propose a counterfactual approach to evaluate explanation accuracy in RS. While counterfactual evaluation methods have been established in other domains, they are underexplored in RS. Our goal is to introduce quantifiable metrics that objectively assess the correctness of local explanations. This approach enhances evaluation reliability and scalability, integrating various recommenders, explanation algorithms, and datasets. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive mechanism combining model fidelity with explanation correctness, advancing transparency and trustworthiness in AI-driven recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>How to Evaluate Serendipity in Recommender Systems: the Need for a Serendiptionnaire (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brett Binst</p>
    <p>Recommender systems can assist in various user tasks and serve diverse values, including exploring the item space. Serendipity has recently received considerable attention, often seen as a way to broaden users’ tastes and counteract filter bubbles. However, the field of research on serendipity is fragmented regarding its evaluation methods, which impedes the progress of knowledge accumulation. This research plan proposes two studies to address these issues. First, a systematic literature review will be conducted to provide insights into how serendipity is currently studied in the field. This review will serve as a reference for novice researchers and help mitigate fragmentation by presenting a thorough overview of the field. This systematic literature review has already revealed a significant gap: the lack of a validated, widely accepted method for evaluating serendipity. Therefore, the second part of this research plan is to develop a validated questionnaire, the serendiptionnaire, to measure serendipity. This tool will provide a ground truth for evaluating serendipity, aiding in answering fundamental questions within the field and validating offline metrics.</p>

    <h3>A Dataset for Adapting Recommender Systems to the Fashion Rental Economy (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jivitesh Sharma, Karl Audun Borgersen, Morten Goodwin, Morten Grundetjern</p>
    <p>In response to the escalating ecological challenges that threaten global sustainability, there’s a deep need to investigate alternative methods of commerce, such as rental economies. Like most online commerce, rental or otherwise, a functioning recommender system is crucial for their success. Yet the domain has, until this point, been largely neglected by the recommender system research community. Our dataset, derived from our collaboration with the leading Norwegian fashion rental company [Company name omitted for review process], encompasses 64k transactions, rental histories from 2.2k anonymized users, and 15.8k unique outfits in which each physical item’s attributes and rental history is meticulously tracked. All outfits are listed as individual items or their corresponding item groups, referring to shared designs between the individual items. This approach underlines the novel challenges of rental as compared to more traditional recommender system problems where items are generally interchangeable. Each outfit is accompanied by a set of tags describing some of their attributes. We also provide a total of 50k images displaying across all items along with a set of precomputed zero-shot embeddings. We apply a myriad of common recommender system methods to the dataset to provide a performance baseline. This baseline is performed for the traditional fashion recommender system problem of recommending outfit groups and the novel problem of predicting individual item rental. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset discussing the domain of clothes rental. It is our hope that the publication of this dataset will serve as a catalyst for a new branch of research for specialized fashion rental recommender systems. The dataset is temporarily hosted at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/clothes_rental_dataset-B1E8/ and Google Cloud at https: //console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/clothes-rental-dataset The code for collecting, processing, and evaluating the dataset is hosted at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Vibrent_Dataset_Collection-03DC/</p>

    <h3>Positive-Sum Impact of Multistakeholder Recommender Systems for Urban Tourism Promotion and User Utility (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Ricci, Pavel Merinov</p>
    <p>We explore how multistakeholder recommender systems (MRSs) can impact urban tourism promotion. Usually, two conflicting goals are of interest: (i) to cut down the number of visitors at popular sites and (ii) to satisfy individual tourist preferences, often biased towards popular sites. By leveraging users’ limited knowledge of the sites catalogue, we model and simulate interactions between tourists and an MRS that jointly optimises user utility and promotes less popular sites. Experiments based on data logs collected in tourist cities reveal that an MRS can lift user utility and at the same time reduce the number of visitors at popular sites, manifesting the so-called positive-sum impact. However, a delicate balance is crucial; under- or over-promotion of unpopular sites in recommendation lists can be adverse to both destination and user utilities.</p>

    <h3>Context-based Entity Recommendation for Knowledge Workers: Establishing a Benchmark on Real-life Data (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahta Bakhshizadeh, Heiko Maus, Andreas Dengel</p>
    <p>In recent decades, recommender systems have undergone significant advancements, particularly in popular domains like movies, music, and product recommendations. Yet, progress has been notably slower in leveraging these systems for personal information management and knowledge assistance. In addition to challenges that complicate the adoption of recommender systems in this domain (such as privacy concerns, heterogeneous recommendation items, and frequent context switching), a significant barrier to progress in this area has been the absence of a standardized benchmark for researchers to evaluate their approaches. In response to this gap, this paper presents a benchmark built upon a publicly available dataset of real-life knowledge work in context (RLKWiC). This benchmark focuses on evaluating context-based entity recommendation, a use case for leveraging recommender systems to support knowledge workers in their daily digital tasks. By providing this benchmark, it is aimed to facilitate and accelerate research efforts in enhancing personal knowledge assistance through recommender systems.</p>

    <h3>FLIP: Fine-grained Alignment between ID-based Models and Pretrained Language Models for CTR Prediction (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Chen, Ruiming Tang, Xiangyang Li, Hangyu Wang, Yong Yu, Jianghao Lin, Weinan Zhang, Chenxu Zhu</p>
    <p>Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays as a core function module in various personalized online services. The traditional ID-based models for CTR prediction take as inputs the one-hot encoded ID features of tabular modality, which capture the collaborative signals via feature interaction modeling. But the one-hot encoding discards the semantic information included in the textual features. Recently, the emergence of Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) has given rise to another paradigm, which takes as inputs the sentences of textual modality obtained by hard prompt templates and adopts PLMs to extract the semantic knowledge. However, PLMs often face challenges in capturing field-wise collaborative signals and distinguishing features with subtle textual differences. In this paper, to leverage the benefits of both paradigms and meanwhile overcome their limitations, we propose to conduct Fine-grained feature-level ALignment between ID-based Models and Pretrained Language Models (FLIP) for CTR prediction. Unlike most methods that solely rely on global views through instance-level contrastive learning, we design a novel jointly masked tabular/language modeling task to learn fine-grained alignment between tabular IDs and word tokens. Specifically, the masked data of one modality (\ie, IDs and tokens) has to be recovered with the help of the other modality, which establishes the feature-level interaction and alignment via sufficient mutual information extraction between dual modalities. Moreover, we propose to jointly finetune the ID-based model and PLM by adaptively combining the output of both models, thus achieving superior performance in downstream CTR prediction tasks. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FLIP outperforms SOTA baselines, and is highly compatible with various ID-based models and PLMs. The code is available for reviewers\footnote{\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FLIP-2534}}.</p>

    <h3>A New Perspective in Health Recommendations: Integration of Human Pose Estimation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaetano Dibenedetto</p>
    <p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in multimodal and multi-source data due to their ability to introduce heterogeneous information. Studies have demonstrated that combining such information enhances the performance of Recommender Systems across various scenarios. In the context of Health Recommendation Systems (HRS), different types of data are utilized, primarily focusing on patient-based information, but data from Pose Estimations (PE) are not incorporated. The objective of my Ph.D. is to investigate methods to design and develop HRS that treat the PE as one of the input sources, taking into account aspects such as privacy concerns and balancing the trade-off between system quality and responsiveness. By leveraging the combination of diverse information sources, I intend to create a new model in the area of HRS capable of providing more precise and explainable recommendations.</p>

    <h3>ReLand: Integrating Large Language Models’ Insights into Industrial Recommenders via a Controllable Reasoning Pool (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyu Chen, Changxin Tian, Jiawei Chen, Jun Zhou, Ziqi Liu, Li Yu, Chunjing Gan, Zhuo Zhang, Binbin Hu, Zhiqiang Zhang</p>
    <p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in addressing the isolation issues faced by recommender systems. However, despite performance comparable to traditional recommenders, the current methods are cost-prohibitive for industrial applications. Consequently, existing LLM-based methods still need to catch up regarding effectiveness and efficiency. To tackle the above challenges, we present an LLM-enhanced recommendation framework named ReLand, which leverages Retrieval to effortlessly integrate Large language models’ insights into industrial recommenders. Specifically, ReLand employs LLMs to perform generative recommendations on sampled users (a.k.a., seed users), thereby constructing an LLM Reasoning Pool. Subsequently, we leverage retrieval to attach reliable recommendation rationales for the entire user base, ultimately effectively improving recommendation performance. Extensive offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of ReLand. Since January 2024, ReLand has been deployed in the recommender system of Alipay, achieving statistically significant improvements of 3.19% in CTR and 1.08% in CVR.</p>

    <h3>Multi-Behavioral Sequential Recommendation (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shereen Elsayed, Lars Schmidt-Thieme, Ahmed Rashed</p>
    <p>Sequential recommendation models are crucial for next-item prediction tasks in various online platforms, yet many focus on a single behavior, neglecting valuable implicit interactions. While multi-behavioral models address this using graph-based approaches, they often fail to capture sequential patterns simultaneously. Our proposed Multi-Behavioral Sequential Recommendation framework (MBSRec) captures the multi-behavior dependencies between the heterogeneous historical interactions via multi-head self-attention. Furthermore, we utilize a weighted binary cross-entropy loss for precise behavior control. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate MBSRec’s significant outperformance of state-of-the-art approaches. The implementation code is available here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EGRQutc9xtVYbsbXswUcTb9nvT1Tc9cZ?usp=sharing) during the review and will be added to GitHub upon acceptance.</p>
