    <h3>Reciprocal Sequential Recommendation (2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Zheng, Hengshu Zhu, Yang Song, Wayne Xin Zhao, Yupeng Hou</p>
    <p>Reciprocal recommender system (RRS), considering a two-way matching between two parties, has been widely applied in online platforms like online dating and recruitment. Existing RRS models mainly capture static user preferences, which have neglected the evolving user tastes and the dynamic matching relation between the two parties. Although dynamic user modeling has been well-studied in sequential recommender systems, existing solutions are developed in a user-oriented manner. Therefore, it is non-trivial to adapt sequential recommendation algorithms to reciprocal recommendation. In this paper, we formulate RRS as a distinctive sequence matching task, and further propose a new approach ReSeq for RRS, which is short for Reciprocal Sequential recommendation. To capture duel-perspective matching, we propose to learn fine-grained sequence similarities by co-attention mechanism across different time steps. Further, to improve the inference efficiency, we introduce the self-distillation technique to distill knowledge from the fine-grained matching module into the more efficient student module. In the deployment stage, only the efficient student module is used, greatly speeding up the similarity computation. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets from two scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReSeq/.</p>

    <h3>Solving Diversity-Aware Maximum Inner Product Search Efficiently and Effectively (2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumio Fujita, Kohei Hirata, Daichi Amagata, Takahiro Hara</p>
    <p>Maximum inner product search (or k-MIPS) is a fundamental operation in recommender systems that infer preferable items for users. To support large-scale recommender systems, existing studies designed scalable k-MIPS algorithms. However, these studies do not consider diversity, although recommending diverse items is important to improve user satisfaction. We therefore formulate a new problem, namely diversity-aware k-MIPS. In this problem, users can control the degree of diversity in their recommendation lists through a parameter. However, exactly solving this problem is unfortunately NP-hard, so it is challenging to devise an efficient, effective, and practical algorithm for the diversity-aware k-MIPS problem. This paper overcomes this challenge and proposes IP-Greedy, which incorporates new early termination and skipping techniques into a greedy algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets, and the results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm. Also, we conduct a case study of the diversity-aware k-MIPS problem on a real dataset. We confirm that this problem can make recommendation lists diverse while preserving high inner products of user and item vectors in the lists.</p>

    <h3>Blockbusters and Wallflowers: Accurate, Diverse, and Scalable Recommendations with Random Walks (2015)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chris Newell, Bibek Paudel, Fabian Christoffel, Abraham Bernstein</p>
    <p>User satisfaction is often dependent on providing accurate and diverse recommendations. In this paper, we explore scalable algorithms that exploit random walks as a sampling technique to obtain diverse recommendations without compromising on accuracy. Specifically, we present a novel graph vertex ranking recommendation algorithm called RP3beta that re-ranks items based on 3-hop random walk transition probabilities. We show empirically, that RP3beta provides accurate recommendations with high long-tail item frequency at the top of the recommendation list. We also present scalable approximate versions of RP3beta and the two most accurate previously published vertex ranking algorithms based on random walk transition probabilities and show that these approximations converge with increasing number of samples.</p>
