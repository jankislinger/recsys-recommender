        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: ‘I like to explore sometimes’: Adapting to Dynamic User Novelty Preferences
Abstract:
Studies have shown that the recommendation of unseen, novel or serendipitous items is crucial for a satisfying and engaging user experience. As a result, recent developments in recommendation research have increasingly focused towards introducing novelty in user recommendation lists. While, existing solutions aim to ﬁnd the right balance between the similarity and novelty of the recommended items, they largely ignore the user needs for novelty. In this paper, we show that there are large individual and temporal differences in the users’ novelty preferences. We develop a regression model to predict these dynamic novelty preferences of users using features derived from their past interactions. Finally, we describe an adaptive recommender, , that adapts to the user needs for novel items and show that the model achieves better recommendation performance on a metric that considers both novel and familiar items.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories. The title is about adapting to dynamic user novelty preferences in recommendations. The abstract mentions the importance of recommending unseen or novel items for engagement, existing solutions balancing similarity and novelty, but not considering user needs. They developed a model to predict these preferences and an adaptive recommender system that improves performance.

First, I&#39;ll start by identifying core themes. It&#39;s about recommendation systems focusing on user preference dynamics related to novelty. So, key areas include Novelty in Recommendations, since it&#39;s central. User Preferences are another main theme because the study looks at how users&#39; interests change over time.

The paper talks about adapting recommendations based on these preferences, so Adaptive Recommendation Systems fits here. They use a regression model to predict user behavior, which ties into Predictive Modeling and Machine Learning techniques.

They mention that existing solutions often balance similarity and novelty without considering user needs, so this is an area of Research in Recommendations. The study shows improved performance, indicating Evaluation Metrics are important. They also discuss dynamic preferences, pointing towards Dynamic User Behavior.

The methodology involves analyzing past interactions to predict future behavior, which relates to Interaction Analysis. It&#39;s a research paper, so it falls under Research Methods and maybe even Human-Computer Interaction since it deals with user experience.

Additionally, they might have looked into how recommendations affect user satisfaction, which could tie into User Satisfaction, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s explicitly mentioned enough for its own category. They also mention the importance of engagement, which is related to User Engagement.

Putting this all together, I&#39;ll list these categories ensuring they&#39;re clear and cover both specific aspects like Novelty in Recommendations and broader areas like Machine Learning.
&lt;/think&gt;
