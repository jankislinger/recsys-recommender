        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: A Recommender System to Tackle Enterprise Collaboration
Abstract:
Collaboration platforms have been available for many years, but they struggle to overcome what is known as the collaboration paradox: people want all the benefits provided by such tools, but they won’t invest their times without some sort of immediate gain. To tackle this problem, we developed an enterprise collaboration platform named Smart Canvas. Smart Canvas is a service that allows people to bring, create and curate content relevant to their organizations. The product’s main goal is to leverage companies knowledge and tear down silos by connecting people, teams, and content. One of the main components of the product is a scalable cloud-based Recommender System, built using techniques like Topic Modeling, Content-Based Recommenders and Graph Analysis. In this demo, Smart Canvas will be presented in web and mobile interfaces, with data from a real customer. We are also going to describe details of the models, algorithms and architecture (which includes tools like Apache Spark and Titan Graph Database deployed on Google Cloud Platform).

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about a recommender system for enterprise collaboration. The title is &#34;A Recommender System to Tackle Enterprise Collaboration&#34; and the abstract talks about the collaboration paradox where people don&#39;t invest time without immediate gains. They developed Smart Canvas, which uses techniques like Topic Modeling, Content-Based Recommenders, and Graph Analysis. It&#39;s deployed on Google Cloud with tools like Apache Spark and Titan Graph Database.

First, I need to break down the key elements of the article. The main focus is on a recommender system aimed at enterprise collaboration. So, right off the bat, &#34;Enterprise Collaboration&#34; seems important. The technologies used include Topic Modeling, Content-Based Recommenders, and Graph Analysis, which are all specific recommendation techniques. These should each be their own categories.

The deployment part mentions Apache Spark and Titan Graph Database on Google Cloud Platform, so those could be categorized under technologies or tools. But since the guidelines mention categories like Family of Algorithm or Domain of the problem, I think &#34;Topic Modeling,&#34; &#34;Content-Based Recommenders,&#34; and &#34;Graph Analysis&#34; fit into the algorithm family. 

The domain here is clearly enterprise collaboration within organizations, so that&#39;s another category. The problem they&#39;re addressing is overcoming the collaboration paradox, which isn&#39;t one of the predefined examples but could be under something like &#34;Collaboration Paradox.&#34;

Looking at evaluation aspects, while the article mentions using real customer data and presenting it on web and mobile interfaces, maybe &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; or &#34;A/B Test&#34; if they tested different versions. But since they presented the system in demo form with real data, &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; seems appropriate.

The tools used are Apache Spark and Titan Graph Database, so perhaps under technologies, but according to guidelines, it&#39;s better to categorize based on algorithms, domains, etc. So maybe just include those as specific categories or under a broader tool category if needed.

Also, the system is cloud-based, using Google Cloud Platform, so &#34;Cloud-Based Systems&#34; could be another category. 

Putting this all together, I should assign 8-12 relevant categories that cover algorithms used, domain of application, real-world aspects, and any specific techniques or tools mentioned.
&lt;/think&gt;
