        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Towards a Taxonomy of User Feedback Intents for Conversational Recommendations
Abstract:
Understanding users’ feedback on recommendation in natural language is crucially important for assisting the system to refine its understanding of the user’s preferences and provide more accurate recommendations in the subsequent interactions. In this paper, we report the results of an exploratory study on a human-human dialogue dataset centered around movie recommendations. In particular, we manually labeled a set of over 200 dialogues at the utterance level, and then conducted descriptive analysis on them from both seekers’ and recommenders’ perspectives. The results reveal not only seekers’ feedback intents as well as the types of preferences they have expressed, but also the reactions of human recommenders that have finally led to successful recommendation. A taxonomy for feedback intents is established along with the results, which could be constructive for improving conversational recommender systems.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. The goal is to help users easily find and explore content by assigning each article to 8-12 categories. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Towards a Taxonomy of User Feedback Intents for Conversational Recommendations.&#34; That immediately tells me it&#39;s about user feedback in conversational recommendation systems, specifically developing a taxonomy or classification of these feedback intents.

Looking at the abstract: It talks about understanding users&#39; feedback on recommendations using natural language to help systems refine their understanding. They did an exploratory study on human-human dialogue data focused on movie recommendations. They manually labeled over 200 dialogues and analyzed them from both seekers&#39; (users asking for recommendations) and recommenders&#39; perspectives.

The results reveal the feedback intents of seekers, their expressed preferences, and how human recommenders reacted to achieve successful recommendations. The paper establishes a taxonomy which can help improve conversational recommender systems.

Now, I need to identify relevant categories based on this information. Let&#39;s break it down:

1. **Feedback Handling**: Directly related since the study is about user feedback in recommendation systems.
2. **User Interaction**: Deals with how users interact with the system through dialogue.
3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Because they&#39;re analyzing natural language feedback.
4. **Conversational Recommender Systems**: The specific type of recommendation system being studied.
5. **Movie Recommendations**: They used movie recommendations as their domain.
6. **User Preferences**: Since the study looks into what preferences users express through feedback.
7. **Taxonomy Development**: They created a taxonomy, so this category makes sense.
8. **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**: The study involves how humans interact with recommendation systems.
9. **Dialogue Analysis**: They analyzed human dialogues to extract feedback intents.
10. **Recommendation Systems**: Broad category that covers all types of recommendation research.
11. **Preference Elicitation**: Since the goal is to understand and elicit user preferences through feedback.
12. **Evaluation Methods**: They conducted an exploratory study, so this category fits as it&#39;s about evaluating how recommenders work.

I think these categories cover the main aspects of the article: the focus on feedback, interaction, NLP, specific systems like conversational recommenders, domain (movies), user preferences, taxonomy creation, HCI elements, dialogue analysis, broader recommendation systems, preference elicitation methods, and evaluation techniques. Each category is relevant and should help users find this article when exploring related topics.
&lt;/think&gt;
