Title: Pick &amp; Merge: An Efficient Item Filtering Scheme for Windows Store Recommendations
Abstract:
Microsoft Windows is the most popular operating system (OS) for personal computers (PCs). With hundreds of millions of users, its app marketplace, Windows Store, is one of the largest in the world. As such, special considerations are required in order to improve online computational efficiency and response times. This paper presents the results of an extensive research of effective filtering method for semi-personalized recommendations. The filtering problem, defined here for the first time, addresses an aspect that was so far largely overlooked by the recommender systems literature, namely effective and efficient method for removing items from semi-personalized recommendation lists. Semi-personalized recommendation lists serve a common list to a group of people based on their shared interest or background. Unlike fully personalized lists, these lists are cacheable and constitute the majority of recommendation lists in many online stores. This motivates the following question: can we remove (most of) the users’ undesired items without collapsing onto fully personalized recommendations?Our solution is based on dividing the users into few subgroups, such that each subgroup receives a different variant of the original recommendation list. This approach adheres to the principles of semi-personalization and hence preserves simplicity and cacheability. We formalize the problem of finding optimal subgroups that minimize the total number of filtering errors, and show that it is combinatorially formidable. Consequently, a greedy algorithm is proposed that filters out most of the undesired items, while bounding the maximal number of errors for each user. Finally, a detailed evaluation of the proposed algorithm is presented using both proprietary and public datasets. i&gt;Presentation: Wednesday Poster Lunch&lt;/i

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article titled &#34;Pick &amp; Merge: An Efficient Item Filtering Scheme for Windows Store Recommendations.&#34; The abstract mentions that it&#39;s about improving recommendations in the Windows Store by efficiently filtering items from semi-personalized recommendation lists. 

First, let me break down the key elements. The paper addresses recommender systems specifically within a large marketplace, which is the Windows Store. It talks about semi-personalized recommendations, which are different from fully personalized ones because they serve a common list to groups of users with similar interests or backgrounds. This approach helps in keeping things simple and cacheable.

The main contribution seems to be an efficient item filtering method that divides users into subgroups so each gets a slightly different version of the recommendation list. They propose a greedy algorithm to minimize filtering errors without resorting to fully personalized recommendations, which might be computationally expensive or impractical at scale.

So, I need to map this article into appropriate categories based on the guidelines provided. The user wants each article in 8-12 categories that are clear and useful for navigation.

Starting with the domain of the problem: It&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically within an online marketplace (Windows Store). So &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; is a primary category. Since it&#39;s related to apps or software, maybe &#34;App Recommendations&#34; would be another specific one.

Looking at the family of algorithms mentioned: The paper uses a greedy algorithm and involves some form of filtering and subgroup division. So categories like &#34;Greedy Algorithm,&#34; &#34;Filtering Methods,&#34; and &#34;User Grouping&#34; come to mind.

The problem addressed is about optimizing recommendation lists, which touches on scalability because Windows Store has hundreds of millions of users. Therefore, &#34;Scalability&#34; is relevant. Also, the approach aims for efficiency in computation and response times, so &#34;Efficiency&#34; should be included.

In terms of aspects of evaluation, the paper evaluates their method using both proprietary and public datasets, which indicates they&#39;ve done a thorough analysis, so &#34;Evaluation Analysis&#34; fits here.

The application aspect: Since this is applied to an actual system (Windows Store), it&#39;s a real-world application. So categories like &#34;Real-World Application,&#34; &#34;Marketplace Recommendations,&#34; and perhaps &#34;A/B Testing&#34; (though the abstract doesn&#39;t mention A/B testing explicitly, but it does talk about extensive evaluation which could involve such methods) might be applicable.

Considering the specific problem addressed is filtering in semi-personalized recommendations, I should include something like &#34;Semi-Personalized Recommendations.&#34; Also, since they&#39;re dealing with a large dataset and trying to minimize errors, &#34;Error Minimization&#34; could be another category.

I need to ensure that each category is clear and not too overlapping. For example, &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; is broad, while &#34;App Recommendations&#34; and &#34;Marketplace Recommendations&#34; are more specific but still relevant.

Let me list out potential categories:

1. Recommendation Systems - Broad category.
2. App Recommendations - Specific to the domain of apps.
3. Marketplace Recommendations - Since Windows Store is a marketplace.
4. Semi-Personalized Recommendations - Focuses on their approach.
5. Filtering Methods - Central to their solution.
6. Greedy Algorithm - The method they used.
7. Scalability - Due to handling millions of users.
8. Efficiency - Aimed at improving computational efficiency.
9. User Grouping - They divide users into subgroups.
10. Real-World Application - It&#39;s applied in the Windows Store.
11. Evaluation Analysis - Extensive evaluation done.
12. Error Minimization - Their goal to reduce errors.

I think this covers all aspects of the paper. I need to make sure there are no redundant categories and that each adds value for a user navigating through these articles. For instance, &#34;Scalability&#34; and &#34;Efficiency&#34; both touch on performance but from different angles—scalability is about handling size, while efficiency is about resource usage.

I don&#39;t see any category that would be too broad or too narrow. Each should help users find related articles easily.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Pick &amp; Merge: An Efficient Item Filtering Scheme for Windows Store Recommendations.&#34; The abstract mentions it&#39;s about improving recommendation systems in the Windows Store by efficiently filtering items from semi-personalized lists without collapsing into fully personalized recommendations. They use a method involving dividing users into subgroups to serve different recommendation variants, which is computationally efficient.

First, I&#39;ll start with the obvious categories. Since the paper focuses on recommendation systems and item filtering, &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; is definitely one. The Windows Store context points towards &#34;Windows&#34; or &#34;Operating System,&#34; but maybe a broader term like &#34;eCommerce&#34; since it&#39;s an app marketplace. 

The method involves handling semi-personalized recommendations, so that&#39;s another category: &#34;Semi-Personalized Recommendations.&#34; They talk about subgroup division and minimizing filtering errors, which sounds like clustering techniques, so &#34;Clustering Algorithms&#34; fits here.

Efficiency is a key theme; they aim for computational efficiency and response times. That leads me to include &#34;Efficiency.&#34; The approach uses a greedy algorithm, so adding &#34;Greedy Algorithm&#34; makes sense. 

They mention the problem of removing undesired items, which relates to filtering techniques. So, I&#39;ll add &#34;Item Filtering.&#34; Their evaluation includes both proprietary and public datasets, indicating empirical studies, hence &#34;Empirical Study.&#34;

The abstract doesn&#39;t specify real-world applications beyond the Windows Store, but they do talk about an extensive research into filtering methods with potential for practical implementation, so maybe a category like &#34;Practical Implementation&#34; would be useful. 

I should ensure each article is in 8-12 categories. Let me check if I have enough and they are balanced.

Current list: Recommendation Systems, Windows Store, eCommerce, Semi-Personalized Recommendations, Clustering Algorithms, Efficiency, Greedy Algorithm, Item Filtering, Empirical Study, Practical Implementation.

That&#39;s ten categories. They cover the domain (Windows Store, eCommerce), recommendation type, algorithms used, efficiency aspects, and evaluation methods. I think this distribution is balanced and each category will have enough articles as more come in.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommendation Systems, Windows Store, eCommerce, Semi-Personalized Recommendations, Clustering Algorithms, Efficiency, Greedy Algorithm, Item Filtering, Empirical Study, Practical Implementation</code></pre>
