Title: Positive-Sum Impact of Multistakeholder Recommender Systems for Urban Tourism Promotion and User Utility
Abstract:
We explore how multistakeholder recommender systems (MRSs) can impact urban tourism promotion. Usually, two conflicting goals are of interest: (i) to cut down the number of visitors at popular sites and (ii) to satisfy individual tourist preferences, often biased towards popular sites. By leveraging users’ limited knowledge of the sites catalogue, we model and simulate interactions between tourists and an MRS that jointly optimises user utility and promotes less popular sites. Experiments based on data logs collected in tourist cities reveal that an MRS can lift user utility and at the same time reduce the number of visitors at popular sites, manifesting the so-called positive-sum impact. However, a delicate balance is crucial; under- or over-promotion of unpopular sites in recommendation lists can be adverse to both destination and user utilities.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article about multistakeholder recommender systems for urban tourism. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, looking at the title: &#34;Positive-Sum Impact of Multistakeholder Recommender Systems for Urban Tourism Promotion and User Utility.&#34; The main elements here are MRS (Multistakeholder Recommender Systems), urban tourism promotion, user utility, and positive-sum impact. So I know it&#39;s about recommendation systems applied in a tourism context.

Moving to the abstract: It talks about how MRS can balance two goals—reducing overcrowding at popular sites and satisfying tourists who tend to prefer those same popular spots. The authors model interactions between tourists and an MRS that optimizes both user satisfaction and promotion of less visited sites. They found that this approach can benefit both users and destinations but require a careful balance.

Now, thinking about the categories. I need to assign 8-12 relevant ones based on the content. Let&#39;s start with the obvious:

1. **Multistakeholder Recommender Systems (MRS)**: This is central to the study.
2. **Urban Tourism**: The domain where the recommendation system is applied.
3. **Recommender Systems**: Broad category, but essential since it&#39;s a recommendation model.

Next, looking at specific aspects mentioned:

4. **Tourist Behavior**: The article discusses how tourists interact with the system and their preferences.
5. **Positive-Sum Impact**: This refers to benefits for both users and destinations, so it&#39;s a key finding.
6. **Balanced Optimization**: They&#39;re optimizing for two conflicting goals, which is an important aspect.

Thinking about evaluation aspects:

7. **User Satisfaction**: The study aims to satisfy individual preferences.
8. **Destination Management**: Promoting less popular sites ties into destination management strategies.
9. **Recommendation Strategies**: The methods used in recommendations are a specific category here.

Additionally, considering the broader implications and applications:

10. **Crowdsourcing**: Although not explicitly mentioned, the idea of leveraging user interactions could relate to this.
11. **Tourism Promotion**: Focused on how the system promotes destinations.
12. **Behavioral Modeling**: The study models tourist behavior in their system.

I should ensure these categories are clear and cover both specific and broader themes. Each category helps users navigate based on different interests, like someone interested in tourism might look under &#39;Urban Tourism&#39; or &#39;Tourism Promotion,&#39; while another focused on recommendation techniques would find it under &#39;Recommender Systems&#39; or &#39;Recommendation Strategies.&#39;

I think I&#39;ve covered the main points from the abstract and title. The categories are a mix of specific terms related to the system (MRS, Recommendation Strategies) and broader themes like tourism promotion and destination management. This should help users easily discover this article whether they&#39;re searching for recommendation systems in general or something more specialized.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. Let&#39;s start by reading through them carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Positive-Sum Impact of Multistakeholder Recommender Systems for Urban Tourism Promotion and User Utility.&#34; So, the key elements here are multistakeholder recommender systems (MRS), urban tourism promotion, user utility, and positive-sum impact.

Looking at the abstract: The article discusses how MRS can balance two goals—reducing visitors at popular sites while satisfying individual preferences. They model interactions between tourists and an MRS that optimizes both user satisfaction and promotes less popular sites. Experiments show that MRS can increase user utility and reduce overcrowding, which is a positive-sum outcome.

Now, I need to map this to the categorization guidelines provided. Let&#39;s go through each possible category:

1. **Algorithm Family**: The abstract doesn&#39;t mention specific algorithms like matrix factorization or multi-armed bandits. It talks about modeling interactions but not the algorithm used. So maybe no specific family here unless MRS is a known family, which I&#39;m not sure about. Maybe it&#39;s better to skip this category.

2. **Domain of the Problem**: The domain is clearly urban tourism. That seems like a primary category.

3. **Recommendation Space Specifics**: The article deals with balancing between popular and less popular sites, which touches on cold start issues if they&#39;re promoting less known places. But I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s explicitly a cold start problem or more about diversity.

4. **Evaluation Aspects**: They talk about user utility and reducing overcrowding, so this relates to evaluation beyond accuracy, focusing on societal impact.

5. **Real-World Applications**: The study uses data logs from tourist cities, indicating real-world applications like A/B testing or user surveys, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s explicitly mentioned as such.

6. **Other Relevant Categories**: Multistakeholder Recommender Systems is a key aspect here, so that should be included. Also, the positive-sum impact suggests collaborative goals, which could relate to fairness in recommendations.

So putting this together, the categories would likely include Urban Tourism, Multistakeholder Recommender Systems, Positive-Sum Impact, Evaluation Beyond Accuracy, and Fairness/Oversampling.

Wait, I&#39;m not sure if &#34;Positive-Sum Impact&#34; is a standard category. Maybe it&#39;s better to use something like Collaborative Goal Optimization or something similar. Alternatively, maybe just focus on the aspects mentioned in the guidelines, such as urban tourism, MRS, evaluation beyond accuracy, and perhaps diversity since they&#39;re promoting less popular sites.

I think I&#39;ll go with Urban Tourism, Multistakeholder Recommender Systems, Positive-Sum Impact, Evaluation Beyond Accuracy, and Fairness/Oversampling. That covers the domain, specific recommendation approach, impact aspect, evaluation method, and the balance in promotion.
&lt;/think&gt;
