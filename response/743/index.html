        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Recommenders in banking: An end-to-end personalization pipeline within ING
Abstract:
Retail services in corporate international banks are often constrained by the compliance and infrastructure specificities of the countries in which they operate. In addition, the business model and customers interactions through a banking app differ greatly from other major retail services in sectors like digital streaming or e-commerce platforms. We introduce INGâ€™s Bank retail recommender system, elaborating on how we account for the global vs. local requirements, and how can we benefit from such an approach for our model selection as well as products serving.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article about recommenders in banking at ING. The title mentions &#34;Recommenders in banking&#34; so that&#39;s a clear starting point. Looking at the abstract, it talks about personalization pipelines in retail banking within ING, which is a corporate international bank.

First, I&#39;ll note that the main focus is on recommendation systems applied to banking, so the primary category should be &#34;Banking.&#34; 

The abstract mentions the compliance and infrastructure specificities of different countries. This suggests the article deals with handling multiple regions or areas, so &#34;Global vs Local Requirements&#34; makes sense as a category.

They also talk about how their model selection benefits from this approach, which implies a focus on methodology in recommendation systems. So, &#34;Recommendation System Methodology&#34; should be included.

The title includes &#34;personalization pipeline,&#34; indicating the use of personalization techniques. Thus, &#34;Personalization Techniques&#34; is another relevant category.

Since it&#39;s specific to ING and their implementation within an international context, adding &#34;Corporate International Banks&#34; as a domain category fits well.

The abstract also touches on model selection strategies, so including &#34;Model Selection&#34; helps categorize the methodological aspect.

Considering the application within a banking app, which is a specific domain, &#34;Banking App&#34; is appropriate. It differentiates this from other recommendation systems in e-commerce or streaming.

The focus on real-world applications within a corporate setting suggests adding categories like &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; and &#34;Corporate Sector.&#34; These help users interested in practical implementations find the article easily.

Additionally, since ING is a specific company, including their name as a category could be useful for users looking into case studies of particular organizations. But if that&#39;s too specific, maybe it can be omitted unless required by guidelines.

Putting it all together, I&#39;ll list the categories ensuring they cover both the domain (banking), aspects like personalization and recommendation methodology, as well as the global-local balance and real-world applications.
&lt;/think&gt;

Banking, Global vs Local Requirements, Recommendation System Methodology, Personalization Techniques, Corporate International Banks, Model Selection, Banking App, Real-World Applications, Corporate Sector</code></pre>
