Title: Translation-based Factorization Machines for Sequential Recommendation
Abstract:
Sequential recommendation algorithms aim to predict users’ future behavior given their historical interactions over time. A recent line of work has achieved state-of-the-art performance on sequential recommendation tasks by adapting ideas from metric learning and knowledge-base completion. These algorithms replace inner products with low-dimensional embeddings and distance functions, employing a simple translation dynamic to model user behavior over time. In this paper, we propose TransFM, a model that combines translation and metric-based approaches for sequential recommendation with Factorization Machines (FMs). Doing so allows us to reap the benefits of FMs (in particular, the ability to straightforwardly incorporate content-based features), while enhancing the state-of-the-art performance of translation-based models is sequential settings. Specifically, we learn an embedding and translation space for each feature dimension, replacing the inner product with the squared Euclidean distance to measure interaction strength between features. Like FMs, we show that the model equation for TransFM can be computed in linear time and optimized using classical techniques. As TransFM operates on arbitrary feature vectors, additional content information can be easily incorporated without significant changes to the model itself. Empirically, the performance of TransFM significantly increases when taking content features into account, outperforming state-of-the-art models on the sequential recommendation task for a wide variety of datasets.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about Translation-based Factorization Machines for Sequential Recommendation. Let me go through it step by step.

First, looking at the title: &#34;Translation- based Factorization Machines for Sequential Recommendation.&#34; That tells me it&#39;s related to recommendation systems, specifically sequential ones where user behavior over time is considered. The use of Factorization Machines (FMs) suggests it&#39;s a machine learning approach, probably involving some form of matrix factorization or similar techniques.

Reading the abstract, they mention that they&#39;re using translation-based models inspired by metric learning and knowledge-base completion. They replace inner products with low-dimensional embeddings and distance functions, which is interesting because it combines elements from different areas like recommendation systems and natural language processing or knowledge graphs.

The model proposed is called TransFM, combining translation dynamics with Factorization Machines. This allows incorporating content-based features easily, which is a big plus for personalization in recommendations. They also mention that the model can be computed in linear time and optimized using classical techniques, indicating efficiency, which is important for scalability.

Looking at the evaluation part, they tested it on various datasets and found that including content features improves performance, outperforming existing models. This suggests that the article not only introduces a new method but also validates its effectiveness through empirical testing.

Now, mapping this to categories:

1. **Sequential Recommendation**: Directly mentioned in both title and abstract.
2. **Factorization Machines (FMs)**: The model builds on FMs, so this is a key category.
3. **Translation Models**: They use translation dynamics from other areas like metric learning.
4. **Content-Based Features**: Since the model can incorporate content info easily.
5. **Recommendation Systems**: Broad category that includes all recommendation-related topics.
6. **Matrix Factorization**: FMs are related to this technique, though they&#39;re enhancing it with translations.
7. **Metric Learning**: Used in their approach for measuring distances between embeddings.
8. **Knowledge-Base Completion**: They draw inspiration from this field.
9. **Evaluation Methods**: The article includes empirical evaluations across datasets.
10. **Scalability**: Mention of linear computation time and efficient optimization suggests focus on scalability.
11. **Algorithm Design**: Introducing a new model, TransFM, fits here.
12. **User Behavior Modeling**: Since it&#39;s about predicting future behavior based on past interactions.

I think these categories cover the main aspects of the article: the specific techniques used (translation models, FMs), the application area (sequential recommendation, recommendation systems), how they evaluate their approach, and broader topics like scalability and algorithm design. This should help users find the article when searching for any of these relevant areas.

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task. The article is about &#34;Translation-based Factorization Machines for Sequential Recommendation.&#34; Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out what categories fit best.

First off, looking at the title and abstract, it&#39;s clear that the focus is on sequential recommendation algorithms. So, one category is definitely Sequential Recommendation.

The model they&#39;re proposing uses Factorization Machines (FMs), which are a type of algorithm used in recommendation systems. So, I&#39;ll add Factorization Machines as another category.

They mention using translation dynamics, which ties into metric learning and knowledge base completion. That suggests that the paper combines elements from both areas, so Translation-Based Models should be included.

The abstract talks about enhancing state-of-the-art performance by combining translation approaches with FMs. So, this is a novel approach in recommendation systems, making it a Hybrid Model.

They also discuss incorporating content-based features and show improved performance when doing so. Content-Based Recommendations is another key category here.

Looking at the methodology, they use embeddings and translate them using squared Euclidean distance, which falls under Embedding Techniques. So that&#39;s another category.

Since they evaluate their model empirically on various datasets and show significant improvements, Empirical Evaluation is relevant.

The paper also touches on scalability aspects because it mentions that the model can be optimized using classical techniques and works with arbitrary feature vectors, making it scalable. Therefore, Scalability is a good fit.

Lastly, the focus is on sequential data, so Sequential Data Analysis or something similar might be appropriate, but I think Sequential Recommendation covers that aspect already.

Wait, let me make sure I didn&#39;t miss any other key points. They mention avoiding inner products in favor of distance functions and enhancing model performance, which all tie back to the categories I&#39;ve chosen. I don&#39;t see any need for additional categories beyond these.
&lt;/think&gt;
