        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Societal Sorting as a Systemic Risk of Recommenders
Abstract:
Political scientists distinguish between polarization (loosely, people moving further apart along a single dimension) and sorting (an increase in the probabilistic dependence between multiple dimensions of individual difference). Among other harms, sorting can increase the risk of conflict escalation by reinforcing us-and-them group identities and reducing the prevalence of cross-cutting affiliations. In this paper, we (i) review normative arguments for high or low sortedness, (ii) summarize the mechanisms by which sortedness can change, and (iii) show that under a simple model of social media recommender-driven preference change, personalized engagement-based ranking creates a systematic tendency towards sorting, while ranking by diverse engagement (sometimes called “bridging-based ranking”) mitigates this tendency. We conclude by considering the implications for those conducting systemic risk assessments of very large online platforms under the EU Digital Services Act.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. The goal is to make sure users can easily find and explore content by assigning each article to at least 8-12 categories.

First, looking at the title: &#34;Societal Sorting as a Systemic Risk of Recommenders.&#34; It mentions recommenders, which are recommendation systems. So that&#39;s one category: Recommendation Systems.

The abstract talks about polarization and sorting in political science terms. Polarization is a social issue, so Social Networks could be another category since it deals with how people connect online. 

It also discusses systemic risks, especially under the EU Digital Services Act. That falls into Regulatory Frameworks because it&#39;s about policies governing digital platforms.

The paper reviews normative arguments for sortedness, which relates to fairness and ethical considerations in algorithms. So Fairness, Trust &amp; Ethics is appropriate here.

The mechanisms by which sortedness changes suggest looking at how recommendation systems operate. Therefore, Recommendation Mechanisms should be included.

They mention a model of social media recommenders driving preference change. This ties into Social Media Analysis as the study is within that context.

The conclusion touches on implications for systemic risk assessments under EU regulations, so Systemic Risk Assessment is another category.

The paper also deals with conflicts and group identities, which are aspects of conflict analysis. Hence, Conflict Analysis fits here.

Personalized ranking based on engagement is discussed, linking to Personalization Techniques in recommendation systems.

Diverse engagement strategies are suggested as a mitigating factor, pointing towards Diversity in Recommendations.

Engagement-based ranking is another mechanism, so Engagement-Based Ranking should be included.

Lastly, the study&#39;s implications for assessing systemic risks tie into Assessing Systemic Risks under regulations like the EU DSA. So that&#39;s another category.

Putting it all together, I&#39;ve covered various angles from recommendation systems to ethical considerations and specific mechanisms.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article titled &#34;Societal Sorting as a Systemic Risk of Recommenders.&#34; The abstract discusses how recommendation systems might contribute to societal sorting, which can increase conflict risks. It covers normative arguments, mechanisms of change, and proposes a model where engagement-based ranking leads to more sorting, while diverse engagement mitigates it.

First, the article is about recommenders&#39; impact on society, so &#34;Recommender Systems&#34; is definitely a primary category. It talks about systemic risk, which relates to broader societal impacts, so I&#39;ll include that too. The paper also discusses polarization and sorting, which are related to how users are divided or grouped based on algorithms.

Next, the abstract mentions mechanisms of change and proposes a model, so &#34;Algorithmic Mechanisms&#34; fits here as it&#39;s about how the algorithm works. It also deals with ethical implications because it&#39;s discussing the negative societal effects, so &#34;Ethics in AI&#34; is relevant.

The paper compares different ranking methods (engagement-based vs diverse engagement), which ties into personalization and diversity aspects. Therefore, I&#39;ll add both &#34;Personalization&#34; and &#34;Diversity.&#34; Lastly, since the discussion revolves around the long-term societal impacts of technology, &#34;Societal Impact&#34; should be included as well.
&lt;/think&gt;
