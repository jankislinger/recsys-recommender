        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Harnessing A Generalised User Behaviour Model for Next-POI Recommendation
Abstract:
Recommender Systems (RSs) are commonly used in web applications to support users in finding items of their interest. In this paper we propose a novel RS approach to support human decision making by leveraging data acquired in the physical world. We focus on the tourism domain and we consider a scenario in which usersâ€™ choices, i.e., visit to points of interests (POIs), are tracked and used to generate recommendations for not yet visited POIs. We propose a novel approach to behaviour modelling that is based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). On top of this we propose two, non trivial, strategies for generating interesting recommendations, i.e., that differ from the straight next action prediction usually performed by state of the art models. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach outperforms state of the art models in terms of overall utility the user gains by following the provided recommendations and novelty of the newly recommended items.

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about next-POI recommendation using a generalized user behavior model. The title mentions &#34;Harnessing A Generalised User Behaviour Model for Next-POI Recommendation,&#34; and the abstract talks about Recommender Systems (RSs) applied in tourism, using Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). They also discuss strategies for generating interesting recommendations that go beyond just predicting the next action.

First, I&#39;ll break down the key elements. The main focus is on recommendation systems, specifically in the context of tourism and POI (Points of Interest). So &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; should definitely be a category. Since it&#39;s about places people visit, &#34;Tourism&#34; or more broadly &#34;Location-Based Recommendations&#34; makes sense.

The paper uses Inverse Reinforcement Learning, so that&#39;s another category. They mention leveraging data from the physical world, which suggests they&#39;re dealing with real-world applications, so categories like &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; and maybe &#34;Behavior Modeling&#34; would fit here.

They talk about improving user experience by providing novel recommendations beyond just next action prediction. This touches on aspects of recommendation quality, so categories like &#34;Novelty in Recommendations,&#34; &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; (since it&#39;s not just about being accurate but also diverse or interesting), and &#34;User Experience&#34; are relevant.

The approach uses a generalized behavior model, which implies it could be applied across different domains beyond tourism. So &#34;Generalized Models&#34; is another category. Also, since they&#39;re focusing on POIs in the physical world, &#34;Location-Based Recommendations&#34; is more specific than just general recommendations.

They conducted experiments showing better performance in terms of utility and novelty. Evaluation aspects like &#34;Evaluation Metrics,&#34; especially ones that go beyond accuracy, are important here. So categories related to evaluation such as &#34;Evaluation Metrics,&#34; &#34;Beyond Accuracy,&#34; and maybe &#34;Performance Analysis&#34; would be appropriate.

The strategies they propose for generating recommendations might involve some form of personalization or leveraging user behavior patterns, so &#34;Personalization&#34; could be another category.

Considering the guidelines, I need to assign at least 8-12 categories. Let me list out possible ones:

1. Recommendation Systems (obvious)
2. Tourism
3. Location-Based Recommendations
4. Inverse Reinforcement Learning
5. Real-World Applications
6. Behavior Modeling
7. Novelty in Recommendations
8. Beyond Accuracy
9. User Experience
10. Generalized Models
11. Evaluation Metrics
12. Personalization

I think that covers the main points. Some of these might overlap, but they each capture different aspects of the paper.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommendation Systems, Tourism, Location-Based Recommendations, Inverse Reinforcement Learning, Real-World Applications, Behavior Modeling, Novelty in Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy, User Experience, Generalized Models, Evaluation Metrics, Personalization</code></pre>
