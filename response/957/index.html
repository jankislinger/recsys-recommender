Title: Learning the True Objectives of Multiple Tasks in Sequential Behavior Modeling
Abstract:
Multi-task optimization is an emerging research field in recommender systems that focuses on improving the recommendation performance of multiple tasks. Various methods have been proposed in the past to address task weight balancing, gradient conflict resolution, Pareto optimality, etc, yielding promising results in specific contexts. However, when it comes to real-world scenarios involving user sequential behaviors, these methods are not well suited. To address this gap, we propose AcouRec, a novel and effective approach for sequential behavior modeling in multi-task recommender systems inspired by acoustic attenuation. Specifically, AcouRec introduces an impact attenuation mechanism to mitigate the uncertain task interference in multi-task optimization. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AcouRec.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through the information provided.

The title is &#34;Learning the True Objectives of Multiple Tasks in Sequential Behavior Modeling.&#34; The abstract mentions that it&#39;s about multi-task optimization in recommender systems, focusing on improving recommendation performance across multiple tasks. They talk about existing methods addressing task weight balancing, gradient conflict resolution, and Pareto optimality but finding these not well-suited for real-world user sequential behaviors.

The authors propose AcouRec, inspired by acoustic attenuation, which introduces an impact attenuation mechanism to mitigate uncertain task interference in multi-task optimization. Experiments on public datasets show its effectiveness.

Now, I need to map this into categories based on the guidelines provided. Let me go through each aspect:

1. **Family of Algorithm**: The article talks about a novel approach called AcouRec inspired by acoustic attenuation. So that&#39;s a specific algorithm family here.
2. **Domain of the Problem**: It&#39;s about recommendation systems, so Recommender Systems is definitely one.
3. **Specific in Recommendation Space**: Sequential behavior modeling is a key aspect here since it deals with user interactions over time.
4. **Aspects of Evaluation**: They discuss multi-task optimization and improving performance across multiple tasks, which relates to evaluation metrics in recommendation systems.
5. **Real-World Applications**: The approach addresses real-world scenarios involving sequential behaviors, so Real World Applications is relevant.
6. **Task Interference Handling**: Since AcouRec deals with mitigating task interference, this is a specific aspect they address.
7. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: They talk about balancing multiple tasks and Pareto optimality, which falls under multi-objective optimization.
8. **User Sequential Behavior**: This is directly addressed in the abstract as a focus area of their work.

I think these categories cover both the technical aspects (algorithm, multi-task optimization) and the application areas (recommender systems, sequential behavior). I should also check if there are any other relevant aspects or if I missed something. For example, they mention extensive experiments on public datasets but that&#39;s more about evaluation rather than a specific category beyond what&#39;s already listed.

I don&#39;t see any need for additional categories as the ones selected seem comprehensive enough to accurately reflect the article&#39;s content and ensure it&#39;s discoverable under multiple relevant topics.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through them carefully.

The title is &#34;Learning the True Objectives of Multiple Tasks in Sequential Behavior Modeling.&#34; Right away, I notice keywords like &#34;multi-task optimization,&#34; &#34;sequential behavior modeling,&#34; and &#34;recommender systems.&#34; These seem important for categorization.

Looking at the abstract, it mentions that multi-task optimization in recommender systems focuses on improving performance across multiple tasks. The article talks about challenges in real-world scenarios with user sequential behaviors and proposes AcouRec, a novel approach inspired by acoustic attenuation. They address issues like task weight balancing and gradient conflicts.

So, breaking this down, the main categories should include:

1. **Multi-task Learning**: Since the article focuses on optimizing multiple tasks.
2. **Recommender Systems**: As it&#39;s directly related to recommendation systems.
3. **Sequential Behavior Modeling**: The core of their approach involves modeling user sequences.
4. **Task Weight Balancing**: A specific challenge they address in multi-task optimization.
5. **Gradient Conflict Resolution**: Another key issue in multi-task learning they tackle.
6. **Acoustic Attenuation**: The inspiration for their method, which is a novel angle.
7. **Impact Attenuation Mechanism**: Their proposed solution to mitigate task interference.

I think these categories cover the essential aspects of the article. Each category is relevant and specific enough to be useful without being too narrow or too broad. They align with user interests in recommendation systems, multi-task learning, and sequential modeling. I should make sure each category is clear and descriptive so users can easily find related content.
&lt;/think&gt;
