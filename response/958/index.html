        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Integrating Item Relevance in Training Loss for Sequential Recommender Systems
Abstract:
Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) are a popular type of recommender system that leverages user history to predict the next item of interest. However, the presence of noise in user interactions, stemming from account sharing, inconsistent preferences, or accidental clicks, can significantly impact the robustness and performance of SRSs, particularly when the entire item set to be predicted is noisy. This situation is more prevalent when only one item is used to train and evaluate the SRSs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach that addresses the issue of noise in SRSs. First, we propose a sequential multi-relevant future items training objective, leveraging a loss function aware of item relevance, thereby enhancing their robustness against noise in the training data. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of noise at evaluation time, we propose multi-relevant future items evaluation (MRFI-evaluation), aiming to improve overall performance. Our relevance-aware models obtain an improvement of ~1.58\% of NDCG@10 and 0.96\% in terms of HR@10 in the traditional evaluation protocol, the one which utilizes one relevant future item. In the MRFI-evaluation protocol, using multiple future items, the improvement is ~2.82\% of NDCG@10 and ~0.64\% of HR@10 w.r.t the best baseline model.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on the guidelines provided. Let me start by carefully reading the title and abstract.

The title is &#34;Integrating Item Relevance in Training Loss for Sequential Recommender Systems.&#34; The abstract explains that SRSs use user history to predict the next item but are affected by noise from factors like account sharing or accidental clicks. The authors propose a new approach using a sequential multi-relevant future items training objective and MRFI-evaluation, showing improvements in NDCG@10 and HR@10 metrics.

First, I&#39;ll identify key elements:

1. **Algorithm Family**: The article talks about a novel approach in SRSs. It mentions integrating item relevance into the training loss, which might involve specific techniques. So &#34;Sequential Recommender Systems&#34; is a relevant category.

2. **Domain/Problem**: The main focus is on recommendation systems, so that&#39;s another category.

3. **Specific Recommendation Aspect**: They address noise and propose methods to handle it in SRSs. Terms like &#34;Noise Robustness,&#34; &#34;Training Objective,&#34; and &#34;Evaluation Protocol&#34; come to mind.

4. **Evaluation Aspects**: They discuss metrics like NDCG@10 and HR@10, so &#34;Metrics&#34; is appropriate. Also, since they introduced a new evaluation method (MRFI-evaluation), that&#39;s another category.

5. **Other Relevant Categories**: The approach involves relevance-aware models, which ties into item relevance. Additionally, they mention multi-relevant future items in both training and evaluation, so &#34;Multi-Relevance&#34; makes sense.

Putting it all together, I need to ensure each article is assigned 8-12 categories. Let me list them:

- Sequential Recommender Systems
- Recommendation Systems
- Training Objective
- Evaluation Protocol
- Item Relevance
- Noise Robustness
- Metrics (NDCG@10, HR@10)
- Multi-Relevance

I think these cover the main aspects of the article. I should check if any categories are too broad or too narrow, but each seems to fit well with the content.
&lt;/think&gt;
