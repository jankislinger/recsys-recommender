Title: ReLand: Integrating Large Language Models’ Insights into Industrial Recommenders via a Controllable Reasoning Pool
Abstract:
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in addressing the isolation issues faced by recommender systems. However, despite performance comparable to traditional recommenders, the current methods are cost-prohibitive for industrial applications. Consequently, existing LLM-based methods still need to catch up regarding effectiveness and efficiency. To tackle the above challenges, we present an LLM-enhanced recommendation framework named ReLand, which leverages Retrieval to effortlessly integrate Large language models’ insights into industrial recommenders. Specifically, ReLand employs LLMs to perform generative recommendations on sampled users (a.k.a., seed users), thereby constructing an LLM Reasoning Pool. Subsequently, we leverage retrieval to attach reliable recommendation rationales for the entire user base, ultimately effectively improving recommendation performance. Extensive offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of ReLand. Since January 2024, ReLand has been deployed in the recommender system of Alipay, achieving statistically significant improvements of 3.19% in CTR and 1.08% in CVR.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on the provided guidelines. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;ReLand: Integrating Large Language Models’ Insights into Industrial Recommenders via a Controllable Reasoning Pool.&#34; From this, I gather that the main focus is on integrating LLMs into recommendation systems, specifically for industrial applications. The term &#34;Controllable Reasoning Pool&#34; suggests there&#39;s an innovative method involved in managing or generating recommendations.

Looking at the abstract: It mentions that LLMs have potential but are cost-prohibitive for industry use currently. ReLand addresses effectiveness and efficiency issues by using a Retrieval-based approach to integrate LLM insights. They use generative recommendations on seed users, create a reasoning pool, then retrieve rationales for all users. Results show significant improvements in CTR and CVR when deployed in Alipay.

Now, I&#39;ll break down the key elements from this information.

1. **Family of Algorithm**: The paper uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as a core component. So categories related to LLMs are essential. Additionally, it involves retrieval methods for integrating these models into recommenders, so &#34;Retrieval&#34; is another algorithm family category.

2. **Domain of the Problem**: Since this is applied in an industrial setting, specifically mentioned with Alipay, the domain here is clearly Industrial Applications. The main focus is on Recommender Systems, which is a broad domain but highly relevant.

3. **Specifics in Recommendation Space**: The article talks about generating recommendation rationales, improving diversity and interpretability. Also, it addresses cold start issues indirectly by using seed users to generate content that can be scaled up. So categories like Cold Start, Interpretability of Recommendations, and Diversity of Recommendations fit here.

4. **Evaluation Aspects**: They mention extensive offline and online experiments, as well as real-world applications with A/B testing results showing improvements in CTR and CVR. Therefore, categories related to Evaluation Metrics (like CTR, CVR) and Real-World Applications are appropriate.

5. **Other Categories**: The method involves controlling the reasoning pool, so Controllable Reasoning is another specific aspect. Also, since it&#39;s an industrial deployment with real-world impact, that&#39;s a key point.

Putting this all together, I need to list these categories ensuring each is relevant and covers both broad and specific aspects of the article. I&#39;ll make sure to include at least 8-12 categories as per the guidelines, avoiding any overlap or redundancy.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. The title is &#34;ReLand: Integrating Large Language Models’ Insights into Industrial Recommender Systems via a Controllable Reasoning Pool.&#34; From the title, it&#39;s clear that the focus is on recommendation systems and using large language models (LLMs) in an industrial context.

Looking at the abstract, the authors talk about how LLMs can help with isolation issues in recommender systems. They mention that current methods are too costly for industry use but they&#39;ve developed a framework called ReLand to address this. The main idea is integrating LLM insights through retrieval techniques. 

They use terms like &#34;generative recommendations,&#34; &#34;seed users,&#34; and &#34;LLM Reasoning Pool.&#34; This suggests the article deals with generative AI in recommendation systems, maybe under aspects of scalability since they&#39;re addressing industrial applications&#39; cost issues.

The abstract also mentions improving performance using both offline and online experiments and deployment in Alibaba&#39;s system. So real-world application is a key point here—specifically mentioning A/B testing or user surveys as part of their evaluation.

They talk about effectiveness and efficiency, which ties into aspects like Scalability since they&#39;re making LLMs more efficient for industrial use. Evaluation aspects like performance metrics (CTR, CVR) are mentioned too.

Putting this together, the categories should reflect the integration of LLMs in recommendation systems, scalability, real-world applications, evaluation methods, and possibly system deployment. 

I should also consider if there are specific aspects of recommendation systems here—like generative recommendations or reasoning pools. The method involves retrieval techniques, so that&#39;s another angle.

So, possible categories include:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Industrial Recommender Systems
- Generative Recommendations
- Scalability in Recommendation Systems
- Real World Applications
- Evaluation Metrics (CTR, CVR)
- Retrieval Techniques

I think that covers the main points without overcomplicating it. Each category should be relevant and descriptive enough for users to find the article easily.
&lt;/think&gt;
