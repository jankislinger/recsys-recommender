Title: Fairness explanation in recommender systems
Abstract:
Fairness in recommendations is an emerging area in recommender systems, aiming to mitigate discriminations against individuals or/and groups of individuals in recommendations. These mitigation strategies rely on statistical bias detection, which is a non-trivial task that requires complex analysis and interventions to ensure fairness in these engines. Furthermore, fairness interventions in recommender systems involve a tradeoff between fairness and performance of the recommendation lists, impacting the user experience with less accurate lists. In this context, fairness interventions with explanations have been proposed recently, mitigating discrimination in recommendation lists and providing explainability about the recommendation process and the impact of the fairness interventions. However, in spite of the different approaches it is still not clear how these proposals compare with each other, even those that propose to mitigate the same kind of bias. In addition, the contribution of these different explainable algorithmic fairness approaches to usersâ€™ fairness perceptions was not explored until the moment. Looking at these gaps, our doctorate project aims to investigate how these explainable fairness proposals compare to each other and how they are perceived by the users, in order to identify which fairness interventions and explanation strategies are most promising to increase transparency and fairness perceptions of recommendation lists.

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article titled &#34;Fairness explanation in recommender systems&#34; based on its abstract. The goal is to assign it to multiple relevant categories to make it easy for users to find and explore. Let me break down the process step by step.

First, I&#39;ll read through the title and abstract carefully. The title mentions &#34;fairness explanation,&#34; so that&#39;s a key term right there. The abstract talks about fairness in recommendations as an emerging area, aiming to mitigate discrimination against individuals or groups. It also discusses statistical bias detection, which is part of ensuring fairness. There&#39;s mention of tradeoffs between fairness and performance, impacting user experience.

The article goes on to discuss how fairness interventions with explanations have been proposed recently. These strategies not only try to fix the biases but also provide transparency about the recommendation process and the impact of these fairness measures. However, it points out that there are gaps in comparing different approaches and understanding their contribution to users&#39; perceptions of fairness.

The doctorate project aims to compare these explainable fairness proposals and assess how they&#39;re perceived by users, with the goal of identifying which interventions and explanations are best for increasing transparency and fairness perceptions.

Now, I&#39;ll try to identify relevant categories. Starting from the given examples:

1. **Algorithm Family**: The article doesn&#39;t specify a particular algorithm like Matrix Factorization or Encoder. It&#39;s more about fairness in general recommendation systems, so maybe this isn&#39;t applicable unless there&#39;s a specific family it fits into. Since it&#39;s not clear, I might skip this for now.

2. **Domain of the problem**: Recommender systems are the main domain here, but it doesn&#39;t specify books or movies. So &#34;Recommender Systems&#34; is definitely one category.

3. **Specific recommendation aspects**: The article focuses on fairness and explanations in recommendations. So categories like &#34;Fairness,&#34; &#34;Explainability,&#34; &#34;Bias Mitigation,&#34; and &#34;Transparency&#34; come to mind.

4. **Evaluation Aspects**: It mentions the tradeoff between fairness and performance, so that&#39;s another category. Also, it talks about user perception, so &#34;User Perception of Fairness&#34; could be a specific evaluation aspect.

5. **Real-world applications**: The abstract doesn&#39;t mention real-world deployments or A/B tests, but it does talk about user experience and perceptions, which are important in practical implementations.

6. **Other relevant categories**: It&#39;s about emerging areas, so &#34;Emerging Areas&#34; might fit. Also, since the project is a doctorate, maybe &#34;Research Project Overview,&#34; though that might be too specific.

Putting this together, I need to make sure each category is clear and user-friendly. Let me list them:

- Fairness: Directly from the title.
- Explainability: The article emphasizes providing explanations for fairness interventions.
- Recommender Systems: The main domain of study.
- Bias Mitigation: Addressing discrimination in recommendations.
- Tradeoff Between Fairness and Performance: The balance discussed between these two aspects.
- User Perception of Fairness: Understanding how users perceive the fairness of recommendations.
- Transparency: Ensuring that the recommendation process is understandable to users.
- Emerging Areas: Since it&#39;s an emerging field as per the abstract.
- Research Project Overview: It describes a doctorate project aiming to investigate and compare approaches.

I think these categories cover the main points. Each one should help users find related articles based on their interests, whether they&#39;re focused on fairness itself, how explanations work, or broader themes like tradeoffs and transparency in recommendation systems.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to help categorize this research article about fairness explanations in recommender systems. Let&#39;s break it down step by step.

First, the title is &#34;Fairness Explanation in Recommender Systems.&#34; That immediately tells me that the focus is on fairness within recommendation algorithms and how these can be explained. So, I should think about categories related to fairness, recommendations, explanations, etc.

Looking at the abstract: The article discusses emerging work on fairness in recommender systems aiming to reduce discrimination against individuals or groups. It mentions statistical bias detection, which sounds like it&#39;s dealing with detecting unfair patterns in data. Then, they talk about interventions that balance fairness and performance tradeoffs. They also mention explanations for these fairness interventions, which ties into making the recommendation process transparent.

So, key points from the abstract:
1. Fairness in recommendations.
2. Mitigating discrimination.
3. Statistical bias detection.
4. Trade-offs between fairness and recommendation performance.
5. Explainable algorithms providing transparency.
6. User perceptions of fairness and explanations.

Now, mapping these to categories:

- **Fairness**: Directly related to the topic.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Since it&#39;s about recommender systems.
- **Explainability**: The article emphasizes explaining fairness interventions.
- **Bias Detection**: Mentioned as part of statistical analysis for bias.
- **Algorithmic Fairness**: This is a specific area in machine learning and recommendations focused on fairness.
- **User Perception**: The study looks into how users perceive these fairness interventions.
- **Transparency**: Explainability contributes to transparency in algorithms.

I should check if there are other relevant categories. Since the article talks about trade-offs between fairness and performance, maybe &#34;Performance Metrics&#34; could be a category? But looking back at the examples provided earlier, categories like Scalability or Web Systems weren&#39;t included here, so perhaps that&#39;s not needed.

Also, since the abstract mentions interventions in recommendation systems, &#34;Recommendation Interventions&#34; might fit, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a standard category. Alternatively, maybe &#34;Algorithmic Trade-offs&#34; would be better, but the provided examples didnâ€™t include that either.

Considering the guidelines: Assign 8-12 categories. So far, I have seven. Let me see if there are other relevant ones from the examples given earlier. For example, &#34;Cold Start&#34; was a specific category in recommendation spaceâ€”though this article isn&#39;t about cold start. Similarly, evaluation aspects like diversity and beyond accuracy weren&#39;t directly addressed here.

So, sticking to what&#39;s most relevant: fairness, recommendations, explainability, bias detection, algorithmic fairness, user perception, transparency. That makes seven. Maybe add &#34;Explanations&#34; as a separate category since it&#39;s emphasized, making eight.

Alternatively, perhaps categories like &#34;Ethical AI/ML&#34; could be relevant, but I think the existing ones cover it better.

So final categories would be: Fairness, Recommendation Systems, Explainability, Bias Detection, Algorithmic Fairness, User Perception, Transparency, and Explanations.
&lt;/think&gt;
