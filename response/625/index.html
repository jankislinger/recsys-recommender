        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Investigating Multimodal Features for Video Recommendations at Globoplay
Abstract:
Globoplay is Globo Group’s digital video streaming platform and offers a very diverse video content catalogue ranging from international to brazilian productions such as movies, series, soap operas, and TV programs produced by Globo Group. One of the challenges with such large and diverse content collection is its distribution to the user base in order to help our subscribers with finding relevant content that meets their expectations and to increase their engagement with the product. In this work, we show the result of a content-based recommendation approach based on multi-modal features such as visual characteristics and audio patterns found in the video content. Using techniques applied to short videos, we model it as a similarity problem based on the content of the video, where, given a video, we establish the top-n videos most similar to it in the collection. For the evaluation, we conducted a study through interviews with a group of users to understand their perception of recommendations based on audiovisual characteristics. For the future, we plan to: explore and define the best approach to combine text, audio and video features for video recommendations; explore audiovisual features with other recommendation approaches such as session based and collaborative filtering; perform AB testing in production; and evaluate the proposal impact in business metrics.

Alright, so I&#39;m trying to figure out how to categorize this research article about video recommendations at Globoplay. The title mentions &#34;Investigating Multimodal Features for Video Recommendations,&#34; which immediately tells me that multimodality is a key aspect here. They&#39;re using different types of data—like visual and audio—to make better recommendations.

Looking at the abstract, it&#39;s clear they&#39;re working with a large and diverse content catalogue. That makes me think about the domain being video streaming or entertainment. The challenge they&#39;re addressing is distributing this content effectively to users, which ties into recommendation systems as a whole.

The article talks about using content-based approaches, specifically leveraging visual characteristics and audio patterns. So, I should categorize under Content-Based Filtering since that&#39;s a common technique in recommendations. Also, since they mention both video and audio features, Multimodal Features makes sense.

They evaluated their approach through user interviews, which is more of an evaluative method rather than just technical metrics. That points towards User Feedback as a relevant category. They also plan to do A/B testing in the future, so Real-World Applications should be included.

The evaluation aspect beyond just accuracy—like looking at user perception and engagement—is important, so Beyond Accuracy fits here. Additionally, they mention combining text, audio, and video features, which touches on Feature Engineering as a broader category.

Considering their approach involves modeling similarity based on content, Similarity-Based Recommendations is another relevant category. They’re also exploring other recommendation methods like session-based and collaborative filtering in the future, but since that&#39;s not yet implemented, maybe it&#39;s more about Future Directions or something else. But I think focusing on what they&#39;ve already done is better.

They specifically mention video recommendations, so Video Recommendations as a domain makes sense. The platform is Globoplay, which is a media service, so Media and Entertainment are good categories too. They’re aiming to increase user engagement, so User Engagement should be included.

Putting this all together, I think the main categories would be things like Content-Based Filtering, Multimodal Features, Video Recommendations, Recommendation Systems, Feature Engineering, Similarity-Based Recommendations, Evaluation Methods (specifically User Feedback), Beyond Accuracy, Real-World Applications, and Media/Entertainment. Maybe also including something about user-centric design since they’re focusing on user engagement and perception.

I should make sure each category is distinct but relevant. Also, considering the guidelines, each article needs to be in 8-12 categories. Let me list them out:

Multimodal Features, Content-Based Filtering, Video Recommendations, Recommendation Systems, Feature Engineering, Similarity-Based Recommendations, User Feedback, Beyond Accuracy, Real-World Applications, Media and Entertainment, Evaluation Methods.

Wait, I have eleven there. That fits the guideline of 8-12. Also, each category seems relevant based on the content of the article.
&lt;/think&gt;

Multimodal Features, Content-Based Filtering, Video Recommendations, Recommendation Systems, Feature Engineering, Similarity-Based Recommendations, User Feedback, Beyond Accuracy, Real-World Applications, Media and Entertainment, Evaluation Methods</code></pre>
