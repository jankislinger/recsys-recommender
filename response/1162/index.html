        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Explore versus repeat: insights from an online supermarket
Abstract:
At online supermarket Picnic, we implemented both traditional collaborative filtering and a hybrid method to provide recipe recommendations at scale. This case study presents findings from the online evaluation of these algorithms, focusing on the repeat-explore trade-off. Our findings allow other online retailers to gain insights into the importance of thoughtful model design in navigating this important balance. We argue that even when exploiting known preferences proves highly beneficial in the short term, prioritizing exploratory content is essential for long-term customer satisfaction and sustained growth. Our research lays the groundwork for a compelling discussion on defining success in balancing the familiar and the novel in online grocery shopping.

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task step by step. The article title mentions &#34;Explore versus repeat,&#34; which immediately makes me think of recommendation strategies that balance exploration (showing new items) with exploitation (recommending popular or familiar ones). So, I&#39;ll start by noting the Explore vs Exploit theme.

The abstract talks about implementing both traditional collaborative filtering and a hybrid method at an online supermarket. Collaborative Filtering is a well-known algorithm family in recommendation systems, so that&#39;s another category. Since it&#39;s a real-world application, especially in retail, Online Retail becomes relevant.

The article also discusses evaluating these algorithms through online experiments, which suggests A/B Testing as a category. They mention providing recipe recommendations at scale, indicating a focus on Scalability. The trade-off between repeat and explore is crucial for recommendation systems, so that&#39;s another category.

They talk about customer satisfaction and sustained growth, which ties into User Satisfaction. Additionally, their research aims to define success in balancing familiar and novel items, touching on Success Metrics. 

Putting it all together, these points lead me to the categories listed earlier.
&lt;/think&gt;

Explore vs Exploit, Collaborative Filtering, Online Retail, A/B Testing, Recipe Recommendations, Scalability, Recommendation Systems, User Satisfaction, Hybrid Methods, Success Metrics</code></pre>
