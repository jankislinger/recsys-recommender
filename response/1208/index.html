        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Stalactite: toolbox for fast prototyping of vertical federated learning systems
Abstract:
Machine learning (ML) models trained on datasets owned by different organizations and physically located in remote databases offer benefits in many real-world use cases. State regulations or business requirements often prevent data transfer to a central location, making it difficult to utilize standard machine learning algorithms. Federated Learning (FL) is a technique that enables models to learn from distributed datasets without revealing the original data. Vertical Federated learning (VFL) is a type of FL where data samples are divided by features across several data owners. For instance, in a recommendation task, a user can interact with various sets of items, and the logs of these interactions are stored by different organizations. In this demo paper, we present Stalactite â€“ an open-source framework for VFL that provides the necessary functionality for building prototypes of VFL systems. It has several advantages over the existing frameworks. In particular, it allows researchers to focus on the algorithmic side rather than engineering and to easily deploy learning in a distributed environment. It implements several VFL algorithms and has a built-in homomorphic encryption layer. We demonstrate its use on a real-world recommendation datasets.

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about Stalactite, which is a toolbox for fast prototyping of vertical federated learning systems. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title and abstract, I know that Federated Learning (FL) is a big theme here. Specifically, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) where data samples are split by features across different owners. That&#39;s important because it allows collaboration without sharing raw data, which is a privacy concern.

The article mentions that Stalactite is an open-source framework for VFL. So this is about tools or frameworks in machine learning. It helps researchers focus on algorithms rather than engineering, so maybe Algorithm Implementation is a category here. Also, since it&#39;s used for recommendation tasks, Recommendation Systems should definitely be included.

Looking into the technical aspects, homomorphic encryption is part of the toolbox, which relates to Security and Privacy. The framework allows deployment in distributed environments, so Distributed Systems or Multi-Party Computation might fit here as well.

Since Stalactite is a tool designed for prototyping, Rapid Prototyping should be another category. It&#39;s used on real-world datasets, showing Real-World Applications. 

The abstract also mentions that VFL enables models to learn from distributed data without revealing original data, which ties back to Data Privacy and Security. Additionally, since it&#39;s about recommendation systems, aspects like Cold Start or personalization might come into play in related contexts.

I should consider categories that are broad enough but still specific. For example, Machine Learning is a broad category, but since the focus is on federated learning, maybe Federated Learning as a subcategory. Also, considering it&#39;s an open-source tool, Open Source Tools could be relevant.

Putting this all together, I think the categories should include things like Federated Learning, Vertical Federated Learning, Recommendation Systems, Machine Learning Frameworks, Algorithm Implementation, Homomorphic Encryption, Security and Privacy, Distributed Systems, Rapid Prototyping, Real-World Applications, Data Privacy, and maybe Open Source Tools.
&lt;/think&gt;

Federated Learning, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), Recommendation Systems, Machine Learning Frameworks, Algorithm Implementation, Homomorphic Encryption, Security and Privacy, Distributed Systems, Multi-Party Computation, Rapid Prototyping, Real-World Applications, Data Privacy, Open Source Tools</code></pre>
