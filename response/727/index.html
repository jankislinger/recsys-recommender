        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Jointly Optimize Capacity, Latency and Engagement in Large-scale Recommendation Systems
Abstract:
As the recommendation systems behind commercial services scale up and apply more and more sophisticated machine learning models, it becomes important to optimize computational cost (capacity) and runtime latency, besides the traditional objective of user engagement. Caching recommended results and reusing them later is a common technique used to reduce capacity and latency. However, the standard caching approach negatively impacts user engagement. To overcome the challenge, this paper presents an approach to optimizing capacity, latency and engagement simultaneously. We propose a smart caching system including a lightweight adjuster model to refresh the cached ranking scores, achieving significant capacity savings without impacting ranking quality. To further optimize latency, we introduce a prefetching strategy which leverages the smart cache. Our production deployment on Facebook Marketplace demonstrates that the approach reduces capacity demand by 50% and p75 end-to-end latency by 35%. While Facebook Marketplace is used as a case study, the approach is applicable to other industrial recommendation systems as well.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about recommendation systems. The title mentions optimizing capacity, latency, and engagement in large-scale systems. That immediately tells me it&#39;s related to technical optimizations, so categories like System Optimization and Technical Challenges seem relevant.

The abstract talks about caching recommended results to reduce computational costs and latency but notes that standard caching can hurt user engagement. They propose a smart caching system with an adjuster model and a prefetching strategy. So, Caching Strategies should definitely be one of the categories.

Since they&#39;re dealing with large-scale systems, Large-scale Systems makes sense too. The paper is about recommendation algorithms in general, so Recommendation Algorithms fits here as well. Their approach uses machine learning models, which ties into Machine Learning Models.

They deploy this on Facebook Marketplace, showing real-world application, so Real-World Applications and A/B Testing (since they likely tested their changes) are important categories. The production deployment suggests they focused on Production Systems.

Engagement is a key metric here, so User Engagement should be included. They mention optimizing both capacity and latency, which directly relates to Scalability. Their approach is applicable beyond Facebook, indicating Industrial Applications.

Looking at the other example categories provided, I can also consider whether this falls under specific recommendation aspects or evaluation metrics, but in this case, it&#39;s more about the system design rather than the recommendation content itself.

So, combining all these points, I should list categories that capture both the technical and application aspects of their work.
&lt;/think&gt;
