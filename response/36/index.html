        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Towards a Dynamic Top-N Recommendation Framework
Abstract:
Real world large-scale recommender systems are always dynamic: new users and items continuously enter the system, and the status of old ones (e.g., users’ preference and items’ popularity) evolve over time. In order to handle such dynamics, we propose a recommendation framework consisting of an online component and an offline component, where the newly arrived items are processed by the online component such that users are able to get suggestions for fresh information, and the influence of longstanding items is captured by the offline component. Based on individual users’ past rating behavior, recommendations from the two components are combined to provide top-N recommendation. We formulate recommendation problem as a ranking problem where learning to rank is applied to extend upon a latent factor model to optimize recommendation rankings by minimizing a pairwise loss function. Furthermore, to more accurately model interactions between users and items, Latent Dirichlet Allocation is incorporated to fuse rating information and textual information. Real data based experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models by at least 61.21% and 50.27% in terms of mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) respectively.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article about a dynamic top-N recommendation framework. Let&#39;s start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Dynamic Top-N Recommendation,&#34; so that&#39;s a key point. The abstract talks about real-world large-scale recommender systems being dynamic, handling new users and items, and evolving user preferences. They propose a framework with online and offline components to process fresh information and capture longstanding item influence. 

So, the main themes here are dynamics in recommendations, combining online and offline processing, and using specific algorithms like latent factor models with learning to rank and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for better interaction modeling.

The evaluation metrics mentioned are MAP and NDCG, which relate to ranking performance and recommendation quality. They also conducted real data experiments, so there&#39;s a practical application aspect.

I&#39;ll categorize this under:

1. Dynamic Recommendations - because it&#39;s about handling changes over time.
2. Top-N Recommendations - the primary focus is on providing the best top suggestions.
3. Online Algorithms - since they have an online component for fresh data.
4. Offline Processing - as part of their framework, offline analysis captures item influence.
5. Latent Factor Models - a core algorithm used in their approach.
6. Learning to Rank - because they apply this technique to improve recommendation rankings.
7. Textual Information Fusion - using LDA to combine ratings and text data.
8. Mean Average Precision (MAP) - an evaluation metric they used.
9. Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) - another important metric.
10. Real Data Experiments - indicating practical application.

This covers the article&#39;s main contributions, methods, and evaluations, ensuring it&#39;s discoverable under relevant categories.
&lt;/think&gt;
