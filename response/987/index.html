Title: Sequential Recommendation Models: A Graph-based Perspective
Abstract:
Recommender systems (RecSys) traditionally leverage the users’ rich interaction data with the system, but ignore the sequential dependency of items. Sequential recommender systems aim to predict the next item the user will interact with (e.g., click on, purchase, or listen to) based on the preceding interactions of the user. Current state-of-the-art approaches focus on transformer-based architectures and graph neural networks. Specifically, the modeling of sequences as graphs has shown to be a promising approach to introduce a structured bias into the recommendation learning framework. In this work, we will outline our research of exploring different applications of graphs in sequential recommendation.

Alright, so I need to categorize this article titled &#34;Sequential Recommendation Models: A Graph-based Perspective.&#34; Let&#39;s start by breaking down the abstract to understand what it&#39;s about.

The abstract mentions that traditional recommender systems don&#39;t account for sequential dependencies between items. Sequential recommenders predict the next item a user will interact with based on their past interactions. It then talks about state-of-the-art approaches, specifically transformers and graph neural networks (GNNs). The article explores using graphs to model sequences in recommendations.

First, I&#39;ll identify key themes:

1. **Sequential Recommendation**: Clearly, this is central since the title mentions it.
2. **Graph-based Models**: They use graphs for modeling, so that&#39;s another category.
3. **Recommender Systems (RecSys)**: The article is about RecSys methods.
4. **Transformer-Based Architectures**: Mentioned as a state-of-the-art approach.
5. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Another specific method used.

Next, I need to think of related categories that users might find useful. Users interested in sequential models might also look into aspects like temporal dynamics or the order of interactions, so **Temporal Dynamics** and **Interaction Sequences** make sense.

Since the article discusses modeling sequences as graphs, it introduces a structural bias into learning. That relates to **Model Architectures** and how they&#39;re designed to incorporate sequence data.

The paper is exploring different applications of graphs in this context, which falls under **Methodology Exploration**, indicating it&#39;s a research-oriented article looking into various methods.

Putting it all together, I&#39;ll list the categories ensuring each is relevant and covers both specific and broader aspects. I should aim for 8-12 categories as per the guidelines. Let me see if I can find more relevant ones.

- **User Interaction Modeling**: Since it&#39;s about user interactions over time.
- **Deep Learning in RecSys**: Because transformers and GNNs are deep learning techniques.
- **Sequence Modeling**: General category for any model dealing with sequences.
- **Innovative Models in RecSys**: Highlighting that this is a novel approach.

I think these cover the necessary aspects without being too narrow or broad. Now, compiling them into a list separated by commas as required.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about Sequential Recommendation Models from a graph-based perspective. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract again to understand what it&#39;s about.

The title mentions &#34;Sequential Recommendation Models&#34; and a &#34;Graph-based Perspective.&#34; The abstract explains that traditional recommender systems (RecSys) use user interaction data but don&#39;t consider the sequential aspect of items. So, this article is focusing on predicting the next item a user might interact with based on their previous actions. It talks about current state-of-the-art approaches using transformer architectures and graph neural networks, specifically modeling sequences as graphs to introduce structure into recommendation learning.

Alright, so my task is to assign relevant categories to this article. The guidelines say each should have at least 8-12 categories, so I need to think broadly but also be specific where possible.

First, looking at the family of algorithms mentioned: graph-based models and transformers are key here. So &#34;Graph Neural Networks&#34; and &#34;Transformer Architecture&#34; are definite categories. Also, since it&#39;s about sequential recommendations, that&#39;s another category.

Next, considering the domain or problem area—recommendation systems in general, but more specifically, sequential recommendation within that field. So &#34;Recommendation Systems,&#34; &#34;Sequential Recommendation.&#34;

The abstract also mentions leveraging user interaction data and predicting next items, which relates to sequence modeling. So adding &#34;Sequence Modeling&#34; makes sense.

Looking at aspects of evaluation, while the article doesn&#39;t specify particular metrics, it&#39;s about improving recommendation accuracy by considering sequential dependencies. So maybe &#34;Accuracy in Recommendations&#34;?

Applications-wise, this is more theoretical or methodological since it&#39;s discussing approaches rather than real-world implementations. But perhaps it touches on &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; if they mention any use cases.

They also discuss structured bias in recommendation learning frameworks, which ties into how recommendations are generated and evaluated beyond just accuracy—so &#34;Beyond Accuracy.&#34;

Since the models consider user interactions over time, &#34;Temporal Dynamics&#34; is another relevant category.

Additionally, the focus on modeling sequences as graphs introduces a specific method or perspective, so including &#34;Graph-based Methods&#34; would be appropriate.

I should also think about broader categories that encompass this work. For example, &#34;Machine Learning&#34; as it&#39;s a core area, and maybe &#34;Data Mining&#34; since it involves processing interaction data.

Putting all these together: Graph Neural Networks, Transformer Architecture, Sequential Recommendation, Recommendation Systems, Sequence Modeling, Accuracy in Recommendations, Real-World Applications, Beyond Accuracy, Temporal Dynamics, Graph-based Methods, Machine Learning, Data Mining. That&#39;s 12 categories, which fits the guideline.
&lt;/think&gt;

Graph Neural Networks, Transformer Architecture, Sequential Recommendation, Recommendation Systems, Sequence Modeling, Accuracy in Recommendations, Real-World Applications, Beyond Accuracy, Temporal Dynamics, Graph-based Methods, Machine Learning, Data Mining</code></pre>
