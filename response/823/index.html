Title: Rethinking Personalized Ranking at Pinterest: An End-to-End Approach
Abstract:
In this work, we present our journey to revolutionize the personalized recommendation engine through end-to-end learning from raw user actions. We encode user’s long-term interest in PinnerFormer, a user embedding optimized for long-term future actions via a new dense all-action loss, and capture user’s short-term intention by directly learning from the real-time action sequences. We conducted both offline and online experiments to validate the performance of the new model architecture, and also address the challenge of serving such a complex model using mixed CPU/GPU setup in production. The proposed system has been deployed in production at Pinterest and has delivered significant online gains across organic and Ads applications.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about Pinterest&#39;s personalized ranking approach. Let me read through the title and abstract again.

The title is &#34;Rethinking Personalized Ranking at Pinterest: An End-To-End Approach.&#34; The abstract talks about a recommendation engine using end-to-end learning from raw user actions. They mention encoding long-term interests with something called PinnerFormer, which uses a dense all-action loss. For short-term intentions, they use real-time action sequences. They did offline and online experiments to validate the model&#39;s performance and addressed challenges in serving it with mixed CPU/GPU setups in production. The system was deployed and showed significant gains in both organic and Ads applications.

Alright, so first, I need to identify key elements here. It&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically personalized ranking at Pinterest. They used an end-to-end approach, which suggests a comprehensive method from data input to output. They mention user embeddings optimized for long-term actions, which ties into algorithms like neural networks or perhaps transformer-based models since PinnerFormer sounds similar to BERT or other formers.

They also talk about both long-term and short-term user intentions, so that&#39;s something related to capturing different time frames of user behavior. The experiments they conducted were both offline (maybe simulations) and online (A/B testing?), which indicates real-world application and evaluation methods.

The deployment aspect is important too; they mention serving the model with mixed CPU/GPU setups, so this relates to production environments and scalability issues in recommendation systems.

So, thinking about categories, I should start with broader areas like Recommendation Systems and Personalized Ranking. Then, since it&#39;s an end-to-end approach, that&#39;s a specific method category. They used neural networks or transformers, so maybe under the family of algorithms, something like Neural Networks or Transformer-Based Models could be applicable.

The user embeddings are a key part, so User Embeddings is another category. Long-Term Interest and Short-Term Intention capture the temporal aspects they addressed. Evaluation methods include both offline experiments (like simulations) and online experiments (maybe A/B testing). They also talk about real-world applications because it was deployed at Pinterest and showed gains.

Deployment in Production ties into how models are actually implemented in a live environment, so that&#39;s another category. The mixed CPU/GPU setup indicates considerations for Scalability and Performance Optimization to handle the computational demands of such a complex model.

Looking back at the example categories provided, they include things like Family of Algorithm, Domain of problem, specific recommendation aspects, evaluation aspects, real-world applications, etc. So I should map these elements accordingly.

So possible categories:

1. Recommendation Systems - because it&#39;s about personalized recommendations.
2. Personalized Ranking - as per the title.
3. End-to-End Learning - they used this approach.
4. Neural Networks/Transformer-Based Models - since PinnerFormer is likely a transformer model.
5. User Embeddings - central to their method.
6. Long-Term Interest - part of what they model.
7. Short-Term Intention - another aspect.
8. Offline Experiments - evaluation method.
9. Online Experiments/A/B Testing - real-world testing.
10. Real-World Applications - deployed at Pinterest with measurable gains.
11. Deployment in Production - how it&#39;s implemented.
12. Scalability/Performance Optimization - handling computational needs.

I think that covers the main points. I should make sure each category is distinct and relevant without overlapping too much. Maybe some of these can be grouped, but according to guidelines, they need to assign at least 8-12 categories, so this seems appropriate.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommendation Systems, Personalized Ranking, End-to-End Learning, Neural Networks, Transformer-Based Models, User Embeddings, Long-Term Interest, Short-Term Intention, Offline Experiments, Online Experiments, A/B Testing, Real-World Applications, Deployment in Production, Scalability, Performance Optimization</code></pre>

Okay, I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. Let me read through them carefully.

The title is &#34;Rethinking Personalized Ranking at Pinterest: An End-to-End Approach.&#34; So it&#39;s about personalized ranking in recommendation systems, specifically at Pinterest. The focus seems to be on an end-to-end learning approach using raw user actions.

Looking at the abstract, they mention developing a new recommendation engine with end-to-end learning from user actions. They introduce PinnerFormer, which is a user embedding optimized for long-term future actions using a dense all-action loss. They also capture short-term intentions by learning from real-time action sequences. The article talks about both offline and online experiments validating the model&#39;s performance and addresses challenges in deploying a complex model using mixed CPU/GPU setups.

So, I should identify the main themes here. It&#39;s definitely related to recommendation systems and personalized ranking. Pinterest is part of the domain, so that&#39;s another category. They mention end-to-end learning, which is an approach in machine learning. The user embeddings and attention mechanisms are specific techniques they used, so those should be categories too.

They also talk about deploying a complex model, which relates to scalability issues in production environments. Additionally, the article discusses real-world applications since it&#39;s deployed at Pinterest and has delivered significant gains, which ties into industrial applications or real-world applications.

Looking back at the guidelines, each article should go into 8-12 categories. Let me list possible ones:

1. Personalized Ranking: Directly from the title.
2. Recommendation Systems: Core topic of the paper.
3. End-to-End Learning: Mentioned as their approach.
4. User Embeddings: A specific technique used.
5. Attention Mechanisms: Since they mention PinnerFormer, which likely uses attention.
6. Scalability: Discussing deployment challenges and performance.
7. Pinterest: The domain where this is applied.
8. Real-Time Processing: Capturing short-term intentions from real-time actions.
9. Industrial Applications: Deployed in production with gains.
10. Evaluation (Offline and Online): They conducted both types of experiments.
11. Hybrid Systems: Mixed CPU/GPU setup for serving the model.
12. Deep Learning: Since it&#39;s about end-to-end models and embeddings.

Wait, I already have 12 categories here. Let me make sure they are all relevant and cover different aspects without overlap. Each category should be distinct enough to add value. Yes, each of these captures a different angle of the article.

I think that covers all necessary aspects: methodology (end-to-end learning), techniques (user embeddings, attention), domain (Pinterest), scalability, evaluation methods, deployment challenges, real-world impact, and the use of hybrid systems for production.
&lt;/think&gt;
