        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Auto-Surprise: An Automated Recommender-System (AutoRecSys) Library with Tree of Parzens Estimator (TPE) Optimization
Abstract:
We introduce Auto-Surprise1, an automated recommender system library. Auto-Surprise is an extension of the Surprise recommender system library and eases the algorithm selection and configuration process. Compared to an out-of-the-box Surprise library, without hyper parameter optimization, AutoSurprise performs better, when evaluated with MovieLens, Book Crossing and Jester datasets. It may also result in the selection of an algorithm with significantly lower runtime. Compared to Surpriseâ€™s grid search, Auto-Surprise performs equally well or slightly better in terms of RMSE, and is notably faster in finding the optimum hyperparameters.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article about Auto-Surprise into relevant categories. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions it&#39;s an automated recommender system library using TPE optimization. So, the main focus is on automation in recommendation systems, specifically for selecting algorithms and hyperparameters. 

Looking at the abstract, it compares Auto- Surprise with the original Surprise library, highlighting improvements in performance across MovieLens, Book Crossing, and Jester datasets. It also talks about lower runtime and better efficiency than grid search.

Now, I need to assign categories based on the guidelines. Let&#39;s break down the key elements:

1. **Algorithm Family**: The article uses TPE (Tree of Parzen Estimators) for optimization. So, that&#39;s one category.
2. **Domain of Problem**: They tested on MovieLens, Book Crossing, and Jester datasets, so these domains are relevant.
3. **Recommendation Specifics**: It&#39;s about automated algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning, which falls under recommendations and system design.
4. **Evaluation Aspects**: They mention performance in terms of RMSE and runtime efficiency, so evaluation metrics like RMSE, computational efficiency, and recommendation quality matter here.
5. **Real-world Applications**: The library is designed to be used in real scenarios, possibly involving A/B testing or user studies, though the abstract doesn&#39;t explicitly mention these, but it&#39;s implied by their performance improvements.

Considering all this, I should map each element to appropriate categories. 

- For the algorithm family: TPE Optimization.
- Domains: Movies, Books, General (since they have multiple datasets).
- Recommendation specifics: Automated Algorithm Selection, Hyperparameter Tuning, System Design.
- Evaluation aspects: RMSE, Computational Efficiency, Performance Comparison, Scalability (as it&#39;s efficient with large datasets), Recommendation Quality.
- Real-world applications: While not explicitly mentioned in the abstract beyond dataset testing, libraries like this are often used in real-world settings, so maybe A/B Testing or User Surveys could be relevant if they were applied, but since they&#39;re just showing performance, perhaps I can include it under System Design.

Wait, looking back, the categories provided in the example include things like Algorithm Family, Domain of problem, Something specific in recommendation space, Aspects of evaluation, and real-world applications. So for this article:

Algorithm Family: TPE Optimization.
Domains: Movies (from MovieLens), Books (Book Crossing dataset), and maybe a general category like &#39;General&#39; since it&#39;s not limited to one domain.

Recommendation-specific aspects: Automated Algorithm Selection is definitely one. Hyperparameter Tuning falls under that as well. Also, the fact that it&#39;s an extension of Surprise library indicates it&#39;s about system design.

Evaluation Aspects: They talk about RMSE, which is a common metric. Computational Efficiency because they mention lower runtime and being faster than grid search. Performance Comparison since they compared against other methods. Scalability might be applicable as efficient hyperparameter tuning can scale better for larger datasets.

Real-world applications: While the abstract doesn&#39;t explicitly mention A/B tests or user surveys, it&#39;s implied that such a library would be used in real-world scenarios to improve recommendation systems, so maybe including &#39;A/B Test&#39; is acceptable if they applied it, but perhaps not. Alternatively, &#39;User Survey&#39; might not be applicable here.

Other categories: Since the system is automated, it touches on automated recommendations and could be considered under research tools or libraries as well.

Putting this all together, I think the categories should cover these areas without being too narrow. So, including things like Automated Recommendations, Hyperparameter Tuning, Algorithm Selection, System Design, and the specific domains they tested in (Movies, Books). Also, since it&#39;s an extension of another library, perhaps &#39;Research Tools&#39; is relevant.

Wait, looking back at the example categories, there&#39;s &#34;Family of algorithm&#34;, so I should include that as well. So, TPE Optimization under that.

I also need to ensure each article goes into 8-12 categories. Let me list them:

1. Automated Algorithm Selection
2. Hyperparameter Tuning
3. System Design
4. RMSE
5. Computational Efficiency
6. Performance Comparison
7. TPE Optimization (as part of Family of algorithm)
8. Movies (domain)
9. Books (domain)
10. Recommendation Quality
11. Scalability
12. Research Tools (since it&#39;s a library)

But wait, the user didn&#39;t specify &#39;Research Tools&#39; in their examples, but given that Auto-Surprise is a library extension, it might be appropriate.

Alternatively, perhaps including &#39;Recommendation Systems&#39; as a broader category would help, since all articles are about recommendation systems. But looking at the example categories provided earlier, there&#39;s no specific mention of this, so maybe not necessary.

So final list after considering everything:

- Automated Algorithm Selection
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- System Design
- RMSE
- Computational Efficiency
- Performance Comparison
- TPE Optimization
- Movies (domain)
- Books (domain)
- Recommendation Quality
- Scalability

That&#39;s 10 categories. It covers the algorithm, domains, specific recommendation aspects, evaluation metrics, and system design elements.
&lt;/think&gt;

Automated Algorithm Selection, Hyperparameter Tuning, System Design, RMSE, Computational Efficiency, Performance Comparison, TPE Optimization, Movies, Books, Recommendation Quality, Scalability</code></pre>
