Title: HUMMUS: A Linked, Healthiness-Aware, User-centered and Argument-Enabling Recipe Data Set for Recommendation
Abstract:
The overweight and obesity rate is increasing for decades worldwide. Healthy nutrition is, besides education and physical activity, one of the various keys to tackle this issue. In an effort to increase the availability of digital, healthy recommendations, the scientific area of food recommendation extends its focus from the accuracy of the recommendations to beyond-accuracy goals like transparency and healthiness. To address this issue a data basis is required, which in the ideal case encompasses user-item interactions like ratings and reviews, food-related information like recipe details, nutritional data, and in the best case additional data which describes the food items and their relations semantically. Though several recipe recommendation data sets exist, to the best of our knowledge, a holistic large-scale healthiness-aware and connected data sets have not been made available yet. The lack of such data could partially explain the poor popularity of the topic of healthy food recommendation when compared to the domain of movie recommendation. In this paper, we show that taking into account only user-item interactions is not sufficient for a recommendation. To close this gap, we propose a connected data set called HUMMUS (Health-aware User-centered recoMMedation and argUment enabling data Set) collected from Food.com containing multiple features including rich nutrient information, text reviews, and ratings, enriched by the authors with extra features such as Nutri-scores and connections to semantic data like the FoodKG and the FoodOn ontology. We hope that these data will contribute to the healthy food recommendation domain.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. The goal is to make it easily discoverable for users. Let&#39;s start by analyzing the title: &#34;HUMMUS: A Linked, Healthiness-Aware, User-centered and Argument-Enabling Recipe Data Set for Recommendation.&#34; 

From this, I can tell that the article introduces a dataset called HUMMUS aimed at recipe recommendations with a focus on healthiness. It&#39;s user-centered and uses linked data. The abstract adds more context: it addresses the issue of increasing obesity rates and the need for accurate, transparent, and healthy food recommendations.

The key themes here are:

1. **Health and Nutrition**: Since the dataset is focused on healthy eating and nutritional information.
2. **Recommendation Systems**: It&#39;s about improving recommendation algorithms beyond just accuracy to include transparency and healthiness.
3. **Data Sets**: The paper presents a new dataset, so that&#39;s a primary category.
4. **User-Centered Design**: Emphasizes user interactions and personalization in recommendations.
5. **Food and Recipes**: Obviously related to food items, recipes, and their nutritional aspects.
6. **Semantic Data/Linked Data**: HUMMUS is enriched with semantic data like Nutri-scores and connects to FoodKG and FoodOn ontology.
7. **Evaluation Metrics**: The abstract mentions beyond-accuracy goals, so evaluation methods that go beyond traditional metrics are important here.
8. **Real-world Applications**: It discusses real applications in recommendation systems for food.

I should also consider other potential categories like scalability or specific algorithms, but the article doesn&#39;t delve into those specifics. So sticking to the main themes makes more sense to ensure the categorization is accurate and useful without overcomplicating it.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, I&#39;m looking at this research article titled &#34;HUMMUS: A Linked, Healthiness-Aware, User-centered and Argument-Enabling Recipe Data Set for Recommendation&#34;. The abstract talks about the increasing rates of obesity and how healthy nutrition is a key factor. They mention that the field of food recommendation is moving beyond just accuracy to focus on transparency and healthiness.

The article points out that while there are existing recipe datasets, they don&#39;t cover all necessary aspects like user-item interactions, detailed nutritional info, reviews, and semantic connections. The HUMMUS dataset addresses this by including data from Food.com with extra features like Nutri-scores and links to food ontologies.

So, I need to categorize this article. Let me break it down:

1. **Domain of the Problem**: Clearly, this is about food recommendations, so &#34;Food&#34; or &#34;Health&#34; would be relevant categories.
2. **Algorithm Family**: The paper doesn&#39;t specify a particular algorithm but focuses on data collection, so maybe not directly applicable here unless they mention any specific methods, which they don&#39;t seem to.
3. **Beyond Accuracy**: They talk about moving beyond accuracy to include healthiness and transparency, so &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; is a good category.
4. **Real-World Applications**: The dataset is meant for real-world use in healthy recommendations, so including categories like &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; or maybe even something like &#34;A/B Test&#34; if they mention any experiments, but I don&#39;t see that here. Alternatively, since it&#39;s about user interactions, &#34;User-Centered Design&#34; might fit.
5. **Evaluation Aspects**: They focus on healthiness and transparency, which are evaluation aspects beyond traditional metrics. So &#34;Diversity of Recommendations&#34;, &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34;, and maybe even &#34;Transparency&#34;.
6. **Datasets and Data Collection**: The paper introduces a new dataset, so categories like &#34;Dataset&#34; or &#34;Data Collection&#34; would be appropriate.
7. **Semantics and Ontologies**: They mention using FoodKG and FoodOn ontology, so &#34;Semantic Data&#34; or &#34;Ontology&#34; could be relevant.

Wait, the user&#39;s example includes categories like &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;. In this case, HUMMUS is a dataset, so maybe include &#34;Dataset&#34;, but that wasn&#39;t in their examples. Let me check the guidelines again: they accept any other categorization as long as it&#39;s relevant.

I should aim for 8-12 categories. Let me list possible ones:

- Food Recommendation
- Healthiness-Aware
- User-Centered Design
- Semantic Data
- Dataset
- Beyond Accuracy
- Nutritional Information
- Transparency
- Real-World Applications

That&#39;s nine so far. Maybe add more like &#34;Data Collection&#34; or &#34;Ontology&#34;, but I think it&#39;s better to keep them concise and relevant.

Wait, the paper doesn&#39;t mention any specific algorithms used for recommendation beyond data collection, so maybe that&#39;s not necessary. They focus on creating a dataset rather than an algorithm, so perhaps categories related to datasets are more fitting.

Another thought: since they&#39;re enabling argumentation in recommendations, &#34;Argument-Enabling&#34; could be another category.

So adding &#34;Argument-Enabling&#34;, now we have 10:

- Food Recommendation
- Healthiness-Aware
- User-Centered Design
- Semantic Data
- Dataset
- Beyond Accuracy
- Nutritional Information
- Transparency
- Real-World Applications
- Argument-Enabling

I think that&#39;s a good balance. Each category is specific enough and covers the main aspects of the paper without being too obscure.
&lt;/think&gt;
