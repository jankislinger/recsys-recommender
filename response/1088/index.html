Title: Enhancing Sequential Music Recommendation with Negative Feedback-informed Contrastive Learning
Abstract:
Modern music streaming services are heavily based on recommen- dation engines to serve continuous content to users. Sequential recommendation—continuously providing new items within a sin- gle session in a contextually coherent manner—has been an emerg- ing topic in current literature. User feedback—a positive or negative response to the item presented—is used to drive content recom- mendations by learning user preferences. We extend this idea to the session-based recommendation domain to improve learning of context-coherent music recommendations by modelling negative user feedback, i.e., skips, in the loss function. To this end, we propose a sequence-aware contrastive sub-task to structure item embeddings in session-based music recommen- dation, such that true next-positive items (ignoring skipped items) are structured closer in the embedding space, while skipped tracks are structured farther away from all items in the session. Since this causes skipped item embeddings in a session to be farther than unskipped items in the learned space, this directly affects item rankings using a K-nearest-neighbors search for next-item recom- mendations, while also promoting the rank of the true next item. Experiments incorporating this task into SoTA methods for sequen- tial item recommendation show consistent performance gains in terms of next-item hit rate, item ranking, and skip down-ranking on three music recommendation datasets, strongly benefiting from increasing presence of user feedback.

Okay, I need to categorize the given research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me read through it carefully.

The title is &#34;Enhancing Sequential Music Recommendation with Negative Feedback-informed Contrastive Learning.&#34; So, it&#39;s about music recommendations, specifically sequential ones, which means recommending items in a sequence during a user session. They&#39;re using negative feedback—in this case, skips—as part of their model.

Looking at the abstract, they mention that modern music streaming services rely on recommendation engines. The focus is on improving the learning of context-coherent music recommendations by modeling negative feedback. They propose a contrastive sub-task to structure item embeddings so that next-positive items are closer and skipped tracks are farther away in the embedding space. This affects how items are ranked for next-item recommendations.

The experiments show performance gains in terms of hit rate, ranking, and skip down-ranking across three datasets. So they tested it on real data and saw improvements.

Now, thinking about the categories:

1. **Recommendation Systems**: Definitely, since it&#39;s about improving recommendation methods.
2. **Music Recommendation**: Specific to music, which is a key part of the title.
3. **Sequential Recommendations**: The article focuses on sequential or session-based recommendations.
4. **Negative Feedback**: They specifically use negative feedback (skips) in their model.
5. **Contrastive Learning**: They propose using contrastive learning as part of their approach.
6. **User Feedback**: This is a broader category since they&#39;re incorporating user responses, both positive and negative.
7. **Session-Based Recommendation**: Since it&#39;s about recommendations within a single session.
8. **Evaluation Metrics**: They mention performance gains in hit rate, ranking, etc., so evaluation is part of the study.
9. **Embeddings**: They structure item embeddings as part of their method.
10. **Music Streaming Services**: The application is specifically for music services like Spotify or similar.

I think these cover the main aspects: the type of recommendation (music and sequential), methods used (contrastive learning, handling negative feedback), the approach (session-based), evaluation, technical components (embeddings), and the domain application (music streaming). This should help users find the article when exploring these topics.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. The article is about enhancing sequential music recommendations using negative feedback-informed contrastive learning. 

First, looking at the title, it mentions &#34;sequential music recommendation,&#34; so that&#39;s definitely one category. Negative feedback is part of their approach, so I&#39;ll include Negative Feedback.

The method they used includes contrastive learning, which is a type of machine learning technique. So Contrastive Learning should be another category. They also talk about using a sequence-aware model, so Sequence Models is relevant here.

The domain is clearly music, so Music Streaming would fit as a category. The problem involves recommendation systems, particularly in the context of user feedback and sequential interactions, so Recommendation Systems is appropriate.

They mention improving hit rates and rankings through their approach, which relates to performance metrics, but since it&#39;s about recommendations, maybe not a direct metric category. However, since they&#39;re using K-nearest neighbors for search, that&#39;s another point—Nearest Neighbors. 

Also, the fact that this is applied within music streaming services suggests Real-World Applications, so I&#39;ll add that as a category.

I should make sure each category is relevant and avoid too many or too few. Let me count: Sequential Music Recommendation, Negative Feedback, Contrastive Learning, Sequence Models, Music Streaming, Recommendation Systems, Nearest Neighbors, Real-World Applications. That&#39;s eight categories, which fits the guideline of 8-12.
&lt;/think&gt;
