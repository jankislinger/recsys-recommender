Title: PsRec: Social Recommendation with Pseudo Ratings
Abstract:
Data sparsity and cold start are two major problems that collaborative filtering based recommender systems confront. In many modern Internet applications, we have a social network over the users of recommender systems, from which social information can be utilized to improve the accuracy of recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel trust-based matrix factorization model. Unlike most existing social recommender systems which use social information in form of a regularizer on parameters of recommendation algorithms, we utilize the social information to densify the training data set by filling certain missing values (handle the data sparsity problem). In addition, by employing different pseudo rating generating criteria on cold start users and normal users, we can also partially solve the cold start problem effectively. Experiment results on real-world data sets demonstrated the superiority of our method over state-of-art approaches.

Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article titled &#34;PsRec: Social Recommendation with Pseudo Ratings.&#34; Let&#39;s break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title, it mentions social recommendation and pseudo ratings. That gives me a hint that it&#39;s related to recommendation systems, specifically those that incorporate social information.

Now, reading through the abstract: The authors talk about data sparsity and cold start problems in collaborative filtering-based recommenders. They propose a trust-based matrix factorization model. Instead of using social info as a regularizer, they densify the training data by filling missing values to handle data sparsity. They also address the cold start problem by using different pseudo rating criteria for new and existing users.

So, from this, I can identify several key themes:

1. **Recommendation Systems**: The paper is definitely about recommendation systems.
2. **Social Recommendation**: It specifically uses social information, so that&#39;s a category.
3. **Collaborative Filtering**: This technique is central to the discussion.
4. **Cold Start Problem**: They tackle cold start issues, which is a common challenge in recsys.
5. **Data Sparsity**: Another key problem addressed here.
6. **Matrix Factorization**: The method used is a matrix factorization model.
7. **Trust-Based Systems**: Since they mention a trust-based approach, that&#39;s relevant.
8. **Pseudo Ratings**: This technique is central to their solution.
9. **User-Centric Design**: They focus on improving recommendation accuracy for users, which aligns with user-centric design.

Additionally, I should consider if there are other aspects like evaluation methods or real-world applications. The abstract mentions experiments on real datasets but doesn&#39;t specify the domain (like movies or books), so maybe sticking to general categories is better unless the paper specifies a particular application area, which it doesn&#39;t here.

Putting this all together, the appropriate categories should cover both the methodological aspects and the problems addressed.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, let me try to figure out how to categorize this research article. The title is &#34;PsRec: Social Recommendation with Pseudo Ratings.&#34; From the abstract, it seems they&#39;re dealing with collaborative filtering and its issues like data sparsity and cold start problems.

So first, since they mention collaborative filtering, that&#39;s definitely one category—Collaborative Filtering. They also talk about matrix factorization in their method, so Matrix Factorization should be another category.

The paper addresses the cold start problem, which is a specific challenge in recommendation systems. So Cold Start is relevant here. The approach involves social networks and user trust, so Social Recommender Systems makes sense as another category.

They use pseudo ratings to handle data sparsity, which ties into Pseudo Ratings being a key aspect of their method. Data Sparsity itself is also an important theme they&#39;re tackling.

Looking at the broader areas, since they&#39;re working on recommendation systems in general, Recommendation Systems should be included. The evaluation part mentions experiments with real-world datasets, so Evaluation Methods could be another category.

Additionally, since they&#39;re using social information and considering user trust, Trust-Based Models is a fitting category. They also reference state-of-the-art approaches, indicating that their method is compared against existing methods in the field—so State-of-the-Art Methods should be included as well.

I think these categories cover both the specific techniques used (matrix factorization, pseudo ratings) and the broader issues they&#39;re addressing (cold start, data sparsity). They also touch on evaluation and comparison with other methods, which are crucial for understanding their contribution. This categorization should help users find this article easily when searching for related topics.
&lt;/think&gt;
