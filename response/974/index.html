Title: Denoising Explicit Social Signals for Robust Recommendation
Abstract:
Social recommender system assumes that user’s preferences can be influenced by their social connections. However, social networks are inherently noisy and contain redundant signals that are not helpful or even harmful for the recommendation task. In this extended abstract, we classify the noise in the explicit social links into intrinsic noise and extrinsic noise. Intrinsic noises are those edges that are natural in the social network but do not have an influence on the user preference modeling; Extrinsic noises, on the other hand, are those social links that are introduced intentionally through malicious attacks such that the attackers can manipulate the social influence to bias the recommendation outcome. To tackle this issue, we first propose a denoising framework that utilizes the information bottleneck principle and contrastive learning to filter out the noisy social edges and use the edges that are socially influential to enhance item prediction. Experiments will be conducted on the real-world datasets for the Top-K ranking evaluation as well as the model’s robustness to simulated social noises. Finally, we discuss the future plan about how to defend against extrinsic noise, which results from the malicious attack.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by understanding what the article is about.

The title is &#34;Denoising Explicit Social Signals for Robust Recommendation.&#34; So it&#39;s about social recommender systems, specifically dealing with noise in explicit social signals. The goal seems to be improving recommendation robustness by cleaning up these noisy signals.

Looking at the abstract: It discusses how social networks are noisy and can have both intrinsic and extrinsic noises. Intrinsic noise is natural but unhelpful for preference modeling, while extrinsic noise comes from malicious attacks trying to manipulate recommendations. They propose a denoising framework using information bottleneck principle and contrastive learning. Experiments use real datasets and evaluate Top-K ranking and robustness against simulated noise. Future work includes defending against extrinsic noise.

Now, I&#39;ll break down the key elements:

1. **Algorithm Family**: The article mentions using an information bottleneck principle and contrastive learning. These are techniques used in machine learning, so categories like Denoising Frameworks and Contrastive Learning come to mind. Also, since it&#39;s about recommendations, Matrix Factorization (a common recommendation algorithm) might be relevant.

2. **Domain of Problem**: The focus is on Social Networks as the domain where recommendations are applied. So Social Recommender Systems should be a category.

3. **Specific Recommendation Aspect**: It deals with noise in social signals, so categories like Noise Filtering and Robustness in Recommendations make sense. Also, since it&#39;s about explicit social links, Explicit Social Signals should be included.

4. **Evaluation Aspects**: The study evaluates Top-K ranking performance and robustness against noise. So categories like Top-K Ranking Evaluation and Model Robustness are appropriate.

5. **Real-World Applications**: They mention using real-world datasets and discussing future defense mechanisms against attacks. So Real-World Datasets and Defense Mechanisms fit here.

6. **Other Relevant Categories**: The article talks about malicious attacks affecting recommendations, so Adversarial Attacks in Recommendations is a good category. Additionally, it&#39;s about improving recommendation systems through social signals, hence Social Signal Utilization.

Putting this all together, I&#39;ll list out the categories ensuring they cover both broad and specific aspects of the article to enhance discoverability and align with user interests.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Denoising Explicit Social Signals for Robust Recommendation.&#34; Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions denoising explicit social signals. So it&#39;s about dealing with noise in social recommendation systems. From the abstract, I gather that the paper discusses how social networks have noise—both intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic noise is natural but unhelpful, while extrinsic is intentional, like malicious attacks to bias recommendations.

The authors propose a denoising framework using information bottleneck principle and contrastive learning. They aim to filter out noisy edges to improve item prediction. The experiments are on real-world datasets for Top-K ranking and model robustness against noise.

Now, considering the categories:

1. **Explicit Social Signals**: Directly relevant since the article focuses on these signals.
2. **Noise Reduction**: A key aspect as they&#39;re denoising social signals.
3. **Robust Recommender Systems**: The main goal is to make recommendations more robust by reducing noise.
4. **Information Bottleneck Principle**: Mentioned in the abstract, so this is a specific method used.
5. **Contrastive Learning**: Another technique applied in their framework.
6. **Social Network Analysis**: Since it deals with social connections and networks.
7. **Malicious Attacks**: Extrinsic noise comes from attacks, so this category fits.
8. **Evaluation Metrics (Top-K Ranking)**: They use Top-K for evaluation.
9. **Model Robustness**: Testing against simulated noises shows model robustness.

I should ensure these categories are clear and cover all relevant aspects without being too specific or broad. Each category is essential to the article&#39;s content, so assigning them makes sense for discoverability and navigation.
&lt;/think&gt;
