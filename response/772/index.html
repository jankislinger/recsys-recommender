        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Off-Policy Actor Critic for Recommender Systems
Abstract:
Industrial recommendation platforms are increasingly concerned with how to make recommendations that cause users to enjoy their long term experience on the platform. Reinforcement learning emerged naturally as an appealing approach for its promise in 1) combating feedback loop effect resulted from myopic system behaviors; and 2) sequential planning to optimize long term outcome. Scaling RL algorithms to production recommender systems serving billions of users and contents, however remain challenging. Sample inefficiency and instability of online RL hinder its widespread adoption in production. Offline RL enables usage of off-policy data and batch learning. It on the other hand faces significant challenges in learning due to the distribution shift.
A REINFORCE agent [3] was successfully tested for YouTube recommendation, significantly outperforming a sophisticated supervised learning production system. Off-policy correction was employed to learn from logged data. The algorithm partially mitigates the distribution shift by employing a one-step importance weighting. We resort to the off-policy actor critic algorithms to addresses the distribution shift to a better extent. Here we share the key designs in setting up an off-policy actor-critic agent for production recommender systems. It extends  [3] with a critic network that estimates the value of any state-action pairs under the target learned policy through temporal difference learning. We demonstrate in offline and live experiments that the new framework out-performs baseline and improves long term user experience.
An interesting discovery along our investigation is that recommendation agents that employ a softmax policy parameterization, can end up being too pessimistic about out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Finding the right balance between pessimism and optimism on OOD actions is critical to the success of offline RL for recommender systems.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its content. The title is &#34;Off-Policy Actor Critic for Recommender Systems,&#34; which immediately tells me it&#39;s about reinforcement learning applied to recommendation systems.

Looking at the abstract, they mention reinforcement learning (RL) being used in industrial platforms to improve long-term user experience by combating feedback loops and optimizing sequential planning. This indicates that RL algorithms are a key focus here. They also talk about scaling these algorithms for production systems with billions of users, which points to scalability as an important aspect.

The abstract discusses challenges like sample inefficiency and instability in online RL, leading them to use offline RL instead. Offline RL uses off-policy data and batch learning but faces issues with distribution shift. The article mentions using an off-policy actor-critic algorithm, extending a previous REINFORCE agent by adding a critic network for value estimation.

They also found that recommendation agents with softmax policies can be too pessimistic about out-of-distribution actions, so balancing optimism and pessimism is crucial. This touches on policy design and the evaluation of recommendation systems beyond just accuracy.

Considering these points, I should categorize the article under areas like Reinforcement Learning, Recommendation Systems, Offline RL, Actor-Critic Methods, Off-Policy Learning, Production Systems, Distribution Shift, State-Action Value Estimation, Softmax Policy, and Evaluation in Recommenders.
&lt;/think&gt;

Reinforcement Learning, Recommendation Systems, Offline Reinforcement Learning, Actor-Critic Methods, Off-Policy Learning, Production Systems, Distribution Shift, State-Action Value Estimation, Softmax Policy, Evaluation of Recommendations.</code></pre>
