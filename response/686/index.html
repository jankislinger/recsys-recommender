        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Dynamic Graph Construction for Improving Diversity of Recommendation
Abstract:
The diversity of recommendation has attracted a lot of attention in recommender systems due to its ability to improve user experience. Most of the diversified recommendation tasks usually exploit user-item interaction records for mining user explicit preferences, while rarely explore the user-item non-interaction records. For diversified recommendations, however, the neglected non-interaction records are especially important for capturing usersâ€™ potential interests to improve the diversity of recommendation. Moreover, the majority of diversified recommendation methods run in two stages: first optimizing the users and items embeddings by relevance, then generating the diversified items list by post-processing methods. These methods are not end-to-end thus can hardly reach global optimum. To solve above limitations, we propose an end-to-end Dynamic Diversified Graph framework (DDGraph) which constructs the user-item graph dynamically based on the users and items embeddings. Technically, we initialize a user-item interaction graph and dynamically update the graph by selecting a set of diverse items for each user and building links between the items and user. The selection of diverse items can be achieved by different candidate selection operators. Specifically, we design a Quantile Progressive Candidate Selection (QPCS) operator based on the latent space division. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to diversify recommendation results by dynamic end-to-end graph construction and the QPCS has a higher computational efficiency than other operators. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the DDGraph framework.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about Dynamic Graph Construction for Improving Diversity in Recommendations. Let&#39;s start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Dynamic Graph Construction&#34; and improving &#34;Diversity of Recommendation.&#34; That immediately tells me that the main focus is on recommendation systems, specifically how they can be made more diverse. 

Looking at the abstract, it talks about diversified recommendation tasks usually using user-item interaction records but neglecting non-interaction records. The article proposes a new method called DDGraph, which is an end-to-end framework for constructing dynamic graphs to improve diversity. They also mention something about computational efficiency with their QPCS operator.

So, breaking this down:

1. **Recommendation Systems**: This is definitely the primary category because the whole paper is about recommendations.
2. **Diversity of Recommendations**: The title and abstract both emphasize improving diversity, so that&#39;s another key category.
3. **Graph Construction**: They talk about dynamically constructing user-item graphs, so graph methods are relevant here.
4. **User-Item Interaction**: The method involves analyzing interactions, both explicit (interactions) and implicit (non-interactions), which is important for recommendation systems.
5. **End-to-End Methods**: The framework they propose is end-to-end, which is a specific approach in machine learning and recommendation systems.
6. **Matrix Factorization**: Although not explicitly mentioned, the process of embedding users and items suggests techniques like matrix factorization might be involved.
7. **Algorithm Development**: Since they&#39;re proposing a new method (DDGraph), this falls under algorithm development.
8. **Scalability**: The mention of computational efficiency in the QPCS operator indicates that scalability is a concern addressed by their approach.

I should also consider if there are other categories like &#34;Implicit Feedback&#34; since non-interaction records can be considered implicit feedback. However, the abstract doesn&#39;t explicitly focus on this aspect beyond mentioning it as neglected. Maybe I&#39;ll include it but not as primary.

Another thought: the framework is dynamic, so perhaps a category related to real-time or adaptive recommendations could apply. But the example categories didn&#39;t mention that specifically, so maybe stick with what&#39;s provided.

I think sticking with the initial list covers all the key points without overcomplicating. Each of these categories should help users find this article if they&#39;re interested in any of those aspects.
&lt;/think&gt;
