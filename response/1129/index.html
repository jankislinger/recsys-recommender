        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: AI-based Human-Centered Recommender Systems: Empirical Experiments and Research Infrastructure
Abstract:
This is a dissertation plan built around human-centered empirical experiments evaluating recommender systems (RecSys). We see this as an important research theme since many AI-based RecSys algorithmic studies lack real human assessment. Therefore, we do not know how they work in the wild that only human experiments can tell us. We split this extended abstract into two parts â€” 1) A series of individual studies focusing on open questions about different human values or recommendation algorithms. Our completed works include user control over content diversity, user appreciation on DL-RecSys algorithms, and human-LLMRec interaction study. We also propose three future works to understand news recommendation depolarization, personalized news podcast, and interactive user representation; 2) An experimentation infrastructure named POPROX. As a personalized news recommendation platform, it aims to support the longitudinal study needs from the general AI and RecSys research community.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through both carefully.

The title is &#34;AI-based Human-Centered Recommender Systems: Empirical Experiments and Research Infrastructure.&#34; This tells me the focus is on AI in recommendation systems, specifically looking at human-centered approaches with empirical experiments and infrastructure development.

Looking at the abstract, it&#39;s a dissertation plan that emphasizes human evaluations of recommender systems. It mentions several completed works like user control over content diversity, appreciation of deep learning recommendation algorithms, and interactions between humans and large language models (LLMs) in recommendations. Future works include depolarization in news recommendations, personalized news podcasts, and interactive user representations.

Additionally, there&#39;s an infrastructure called POPROX, a platform for longitudinal studies in AI and RecSys.

Now, I&#39;ll identify the key themes:

1. **AI-based Recommender Systems**: The core area of study.
2. **Human-Centered Design**: Focus on how humans interact with these systems.
3. **Empirical Experiments**: Involves real-world testing and human assessments.
4. **Research Infrastructure**: Development of tools like POPROX for longitudinal studies.

Looking at the domains, it touches on news, which is a specific application area. The aspects include user control, content diversity, deep learning algorithms (DL-RecSys), interaction with LLMs, depolarization, and personalized media.

I should also consider broader categories that capture these elements: Algorithm Family (like DL or LLMs), Domain of Problem (News, Media), Specific Recommendation Topics (Cold Start isn&#39;t mentioned here but aspects like diversity are), Evaluation Aspects (Diversity, User Interaction), Real-World Applications (User Surveys, A/B Testing isn&#39;t directly stated, but empirical experiments suggest user evaluations).

I need to make sure each category is relevant and that the list isn&#39;t too long. Each article should go into at least 8-12 categories as per guidelines.

Potential categories:

- AI-based Recommender Systems
- Human-Centered Design
- Empirical Experiments
- Research Infrastructure
- News Recommendations
- Deep Learning Algorithms (DL-RecSys)
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Content Diversity
- Personalization
- Longitudinal Studies
- Media

Wait, but the example categories include things like Family of Algorithm, Domain of Problem, etc. So aligning with that:

Family: AI-based, DL-RecSys, LLMs.

Domain: News, Media.

Specific Rec Topics: Human interaction, content diversity, depolarization, personalized media.

Evaluation aspects: User control, appreciation studies (which relates to evaluation metrics beyond accuracy).

Research infrastructure is a broader category, as well as empirical experiments and real-world applications since they involve human assessments and infrastructure building.

I should ensure clarity and avoid redundancy. Maybe combine some if necessary, but each seems distinct enough.

Also, considering user-centric design, categories like Human-Centered Design make sense for discoverability.

So compiling all together:

- AI-based Recommender Systems
- Human-Centered Design
- Empirical Experiments
- Deep Learning Algorithms (DL-RecSys)
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- News Recommendations
- Content Diversity
- Personalization
- Longitudinal Studies
- Media
- Research Infrastructure

Wait, that&#39;s 10 categories. The example output had more, so maybe I can add a couple more.

Perhaps:

- User Interaction
- Depolarization in News (as a specific aspect)
- Real-World Applications (since it involves user studies and infrastructure)

Also, considering aspects of evaluation like Beyond Accuracy (they talk about user appreciation beyond just accuracy metrics). So adding Beyond Accuracy as an evaluation aspect.

Now, the list is:

1. AI-based Recommender Systems
2. Human-Centered Design
3. Empirical Experiments
4. Deep Learning Algorithms
5. Large Language Models
6. News Recommendations
7. Content Diversity
8. Personalization
9. Longitudinal Studies
10. Media
11. Research Infrastructure
12. User Interaction
13. Depolarization in News
14. Real-World Applications
15. Beyond Accuracy

Wait, that&#39;s 15 categories, which is more than the suggested 8-12. Maybe I should consolidate some.

Looking back, maybe &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; can be covered under Evaluation Aspects or User Interaction. Similarly, Depolarization could fall under News Recommendations or Specific Recommendation Space.

Perhaps:

- AI-based Recommender Systems
- Human-Centered Design
- Empirical Experiments
- Deep Learning Algorithms
- Large Language Models
- News Recommendations
- Content Diversity
- Personalization
- Longitudinal Studies
- Media
- Research Infrastructure
- User Interaction

That&#39;s 12 categories. It seems comprehensive without being too granular.
&lt;/think&gt;

AI-based Recommender Systems, Human-Centered Design, Empirical Experiments, Deep Learning Algorithms, Large Language Models, News Recommendations, Content Diversity, Personalization, Longitudinal Studies, Media, Research Infrastructure, User Interaction</code></pre>
