        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Knowledge-Aware Recommender Systems based on Multi-Modal Information Sources
Abstract:
The last few years saw a growing interest in Knowledge-Aware Recommender Systems (KARSs), given their capability in encoding and exploiting several data sources, both structured (such as \textit{knowledge graphs}) and unstructured (such as plain text); indeed, several pieces of research show the competitiveness of these models. Nowadays, a lot of models at the state-of-the-art in KARSs use deep learning, enabling them to exploit large amounts of information, including knowledge graphs (KGs), user reviews, plain text, and multimedia content (pictures, audio, videos). In my Ph.D. I will explore and study techniques for designing KARSs leveraging embeddings deriving from multi-modal information sources; the models I will design will aim at providing fair, accurate, and explainable recommendations.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about Knowledge-Aware Recommender Systems based on Multi-Modal Information Sources. Let&#39;s see, starting with the title, it mentions &#34;Knowledge-Aware&#34; which suggests it uses external knowledge sources beyond user data. That makes me think of categories like Knowledge Graphs and maybe something related to semantics.

Looking at the abstract, they talk about using both structured (like KGs) and unstructured data (plain text). So I should include Structured Data and Unstructured Data as categories. They also mention deep learning models which is a family of algorithms, so Deep Learning goes in there.

The article mentions leveraging embeddings from multi-modal sources like text, audio, images, etc., so Multi-Modal Information Sources and Embeddings are definitely relevant. Since they&#39;re talking about providing fair and explainable recommendations, I should add Fairness and Explainability as categories to highlight those aspects.

They also mention using A/B testing or user surveys for real-world applications, but the abstract doesn&#39;t specify which one exactly, so maybe just stick with Real-World Applications. It&#39;s a Ph.D. work, so it falls under Academic Research. The domain isn&#39;t specified beyond recommendation systems, so I&#39;ll include Recommender Systems as the main domain.

Additionally, since they&#39;re integrating different data types, Multi-Source Information is another category that fits well. This gives a broad overview without being too specific.

So putting it all together: Knowledge Graphs, Deep Learning, Recommender Systems, Structured Data, Unstructured Data, Multi-Modal Information Sources, Embeddings, Fairness, Explainability, Academic Research, Real-World Applications, Multi-Source Information.
&lt;/think&gt;

Knowledge Graphs, Deep Learning, Recommender Systems, Structured Data, Unstructured Data, Multi-Modal Information Sources, Embeddings, Fairness, Explainability, Academic Research, Real-World Applications, Multi-Source Information</code></pre>
