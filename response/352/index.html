        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Optimally Balancing Receiver and Recommended Users’ Importance in Reciprocal Recommender Systems
Abstract:
Online platforms which assist people in finding a suitable partner or match, such as online dating and job recruiting environments, have become increasingly popular in the last decade. Many of these platforms include recommender systems which aim to help users discover other people who will be also interested in them. These recommender systems benefit from contemplating the interest of both sides of the recommended match, however the question of how to optimally balance the interest and the response of both sides remains open. In this study we present a novel recommendation method for recommending people to people. For each user receiving a recommendation, our method finds the optimal balance of two criteria: a) the user’s likelihood to accept the recommendation; and b) the recommended user’s likelihood to positively respond. We extensively evaluate our recommendation method with a group of active users from an operational online dating site. We find that our method is significantly more effective in increasing the number of successful interactions compared to a current state-of-the-art recommendation method.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about reciprocal recommender systems. Let&#39;s see, the title mentions balancing receiver and recommended users&#39; importance. The abstract talks about online platforms like dating or job recruiting where both sides need to be interested in each other.

First, the family of algorithm here is Optimization because they&#39;re finding an optimal balance between two criteria. It seems specific since it&#39;s about people recommendations rather than products.

The domain is definitely online dating and job recruitment, so Personalized Recommendations makes sense as well. The problem is specifically about matching users where both parties&#39; interests matter, which falls under Two-Sided Matching or Bipartite Matching.

They mention increasing successful interactions, so Recommendation Effectiveness is a key aspect here. They evaluated it using real data from an online dating site, so Real-World Applications and A/B Testing are relevant categories because they compared their method with existing ones.

The study focuses on user interaction dynamics, looking at how users respond to recommendations. So User Interaction Dynamics fits. The evaluation also looked beyond just accuracy; they considered the balance between acceptance rates and responses, which ties into Beyond Accuracy in Evaluation.

Since it&#39;s about people rather than items, Social Recommendations is appropriate. They mentioned operational platforms, so Operational Platforms as a category makes sense too.

The study is about improving interaction success, so Interaction Success is another good category. They used data from an actual site, indicating Field Study Application.

Putting it all together, I think these categories cover the article&#39;s focus on optimizing mutual interest in recommendations across different domains and real-world applications.
&lt;/think&gt;

Optimization, Personalized Recommendations, Two-Sided Matching, Bipartite Matching, Recommendation Effectiveness, Real-World Applications, A/B Testing, User Interaction Dynamics, Beyond Accuracy, Social Recommendations, Operational Platforms, Interaction Success, Field Study Application</code></pre>
