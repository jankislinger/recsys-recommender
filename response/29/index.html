Title: Question Recommendation for Collaborative Question Answering Systems with RankSLDA
Abstract:
Collaborative question answering (CQA) communities rely on user participation for their success. This paper presents a supervised Bayesian approach to model expertise in on-line CQA communities with application to question recommendation, aimed at reducing waiting times for responses and avoiding question starvation. We propose a novel algorithm called RankSLDA which extends the supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (sLDA) model by considering a learning-to-rank paradigm. This allows us to exploit the inherent collaborative effects that are present in CQA communities where users tend to answer questions in their topics of expertise. Users can thus be modeled on the basis of the topics in which they demonstrate expertise. In the supervised stage of the method we model the pairwise order of expertise of users on a given question. We compare RankSLDA against several alternative methods on data from the Cross Validate community, part of the Stack Exchange CQA network. RankSLDA outperforms all alternative methods by a significant margin.

Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about Question Recommendation for Collaborative Question Answering Systems using RankSLDA. Let&#39;s break down what it&#39;s about.

The title mentions &#34;Question Recommendation&#34; so that&#39;s definitely one category. It&#39;s focused on CQA systems, which stands for Collaborative Question Answering, so I should include that as another category.

Looking at the abstract, they talk about a supervised Bayesian approach and use something called RankSLDA, which is an extension of sLDA (supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation). So &#34;Supervised Learning&#34; and &#34;Bayesian Methods&#34; are relevant here. The algorithm itself, RankSLDA, should be its own category.

They mention modeling expertise in online CQA communities, so &#34;Community Modeling&#34; seems appropriate. Since the application is within Stack Exchange&#39;s Cross Validate community, that&#39;s a specific domain example, but since it&#39;s part of a broader network, maybe just noting the domain as &#34;Stack Exchange&#34; isn&#39;t necessary unless we have many such articles.

The goal is to reduce waiting times and avoid question starvation, so &#34;Efficiency&#34; is a good fit. They discuss modeling users based on their expertise topics, which ties into &#34;User Modeling.&#34;

They evaluated using data from Cross Validate, part of the Stack Exchange network, but maybe more generally under &#34;Evaluation.&#34; The evaluation aspect also touches on &#34;Recommendation Evaluation,&#34; as they&#39;re testing recommendation systems.

The method involves collaborative effects where users answer questions in their areas of expertise. So &#34;Collaborative Filtering&#34; is another category because it&#39;s about leveraging user interactions and preferences collaboratively.

Putting it all together, I think the categories should cover the specific algorithm (RankSLDA), the type of system (CQA, Collaborative Question Answering), the methods used (Supervised Learning, Bayesian Methods, Latent Dirichlet Allocation), aspects like efficiency and expertise modeling, and evaluation in recommendation contexts.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task step by step. The article is about Question Recommendation in Collaborative Question Answering (CQA) systems using an algorithm called RankSLDA.

First, I&#39;ll read the title and abstract carefully. The main focus is on improving response times and preventing question starvation by recommending questions to users based on their expertise. They use a supervised Bayesian approach and extend sLDA with a learning-to-rank method, which suggests it&#39;s part of recommendation systems.

Looking at the key elements: Collaborative Question Answering, RankSLDA algorithm, supervised Bayesian model, expertise modeling, and evaluation against existing methods in CQA communities like Cross Validate (part of Stack Exchange).

So, I need to categorize this into 8-12 relevant categories. Let&#39;s break it down:

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Since the system relies on user collaboration and recommendations are based on user interactions.
2. **Recommendation Systems**: Directly applicable as the paper is about question recommendation.
3. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**: The paper uses sLDA, so this category fits.
4. **Supervised Learning**: They mention a supervised approach in their model.
5. **Learning-to-Rank**: RankSLDA incorporates learning-to-rank, which is a specific technique in machine learning for ranking tasks.
6. **Bayesian Methods**: The approach is Bayesian, so this is relevant.
7. **Expertise Modeling**: The system models user expertise to recommend questions they can answer.
8. **Collaborative Question Answering (CQA)**: The application domain is CQA communities.
9. **Algorithm Evaluation**: They compare RankSLDA against other methods, which involves evaluation metrics and processes.
10. **Real-World Applications**: The paper applies their method to real data from Cross Validate, indicating real-world use.
11. **User Behavior Analysis**: Understanding how users participate in CQA communities and model their expertise based on behavior.
12. **Efficiency in Collaborative Systems**: The goal is to reduce waiting times and avoid question starvation, so efficiency is a key aspect.

I think these categories cover the necessary aspects without being too broad or too narrow. Each category should have enough articles as more research comes in, making the interface navigable for users interested in recommendation systems, Bayesian methods, or CQA.
