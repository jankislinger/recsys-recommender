Title: Soliciting User Preferences in Conversational Recommender Systems via Usage-related Questions
Abstract:
A key distinguishing feature of conversational recommender systems over traditional recommender systems is their ability to elicit user preferences using natural language. Currently, the predominant approach to preference elicitation is to ask questions directly about items or item attributes. These strategies do not perform well in cases where the user does not have sufficient knowledge of the target domain to answer such questions. Conversely, in a shopping setting, talking about the planned use of items does not present any difficulties, even for those that are new to a domain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to preference elicitation by asking implicit questions based on item usage. Our approach consists of two main steps. First, we identify the sentences from a large review corpus that contain information about item usage. Then, we generate implicit preference elicitation questions from those sentences using a neural text-to-text model. The main contributions of this work also include a multi-stage data annotation protocol using crowdsourcing for collecting high-quality labeled training data for the neural model. We show that out approach is effective in selecting review sentences and transforming them to elicitation questions, even with limited training data.

Alright, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its content. The title is &#34;Soliciting User Preferences in Conversational Recommender Systems via Usage-Related Questions.&#34; The abstract discusses how conversational recommender systems can better elicit user preferences by asking questions related to item usage instead of directly about items or attributes.

First, I&#39;ll analyze the core themes. It&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically conversational ones, which is a type of algorithm used in recommendations. So, &#34;Conversational Recommender Systems&#34; should be one category. The method involves natural language processing since they&#39;re using text-based questions and generating them with neural models. That points to categories like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Neural Models.

The article talks about preference elicitation, which is a key aspect in recommendation systems. So &#34;Preference Elicitation&#34; is another important category. They mention generating implicit questions from item usage, so &#34;Implicit Feedback&#34; fits here as well because they&#39;re not directly asking users about their preferences but inferring them through usage context.

The study uses a multi-stage data annotation protocol with crowdsourcing for training data. That makes me think of categories like Data Annotation and Crowdsourcing. They also discuss transforming review sentences into elicitation questions using neural models, which is a form of Text Generation, so that&#39;s another category.

Looking at the problem domain, it&#39;s about improving recommendation systems, so &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; is broad but relevant. The approach involves extracting information from reviews, so &#34;Review Mining&#34; makes sense as a specific application area.

The article also touches on user interaction since conversational systems are interactive. Therefore, &#34;User Interaction&#34; should be included to reflect that aspect. Additionally, the focus on usage-related questions ties into understanding how users plan to use items, which is about user needs and behavior, so &#34;Usage-Based Recommendations&#34; fits well.

I need to ensure each category is clear and descriptive. I&#39;ll avoid too specific categories unless they&#39;re essential for discoverability. Also, checking against guidelines, each article should be in at least 8-12 categories without overcrowding any single one.

So compiling these thoughts: Conversational Recommender Systems, Natural Language Processing, Preference Elicitation, Implicit Feedback, Neural Models, Text Generation, Data Annotation, Crowdsourcing, Recommendation Systems, Review Mining, User Interaction, Usage-Based Recommendations. That should cover the necessary aspects for categorization.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. The article&#39;s title is &#34;Soliciting User Preferences in Conversational Recommender Systems via Usage-related Questions.&#34; From the title, it seems like it&#39;s about recommendation systems that use conversations to get user preferences.

Looking at the abstract, the paper discusses how conversational recommenders are different from traditional ones because they can ask natural language questions. The current methods mostly ask directly about items or attributes, but this doesn&#39;t work well if users don&#39;t know much about the domain. Instead, the authors propose using usage-related questions that focus on how items are used.

So the main themes here are conversational recommender systems and preference elicitation through usage questions. They mention a two-step process: identifying usage sentences from reviews and generating questions with a neural model. They also talk about data annotation using crowdsourcing.

Now, mapping this to categories. The first category is obvious: Conversational Recommender Systems. Preference Elicitation is another since that&#39;s the core of their approach. Usage-based Questions fits because they&#39;re focusing on how items are used. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is involved since they use a neural text-to-text model, so that&#39;s another category.

Looking deeper, the paper also deals with User-Centered Design because it focuses on user interaction and preferences. The methodology part mentions data annotation and crowdsourcing, so Data Annotation/Crowdsourcing is relevant too. Review Analysis is present as they use review corpora to find usage information. Finally, Implicit Feedback might be applicable since they&#39;re indirectly getting user preferences through usage questions.

So the categories would include Conversational Recommender Systems, Preference Elicitation, Usage-based Questions, Natural Language Processing (NLP), User-Centered Design, Data Annotation/Crowdsourcing, Review Analysis, and Implicit Feedback.
&lt;/think&gt;
