Title: Streaming Session-Based Recommendation: When Graph Neural Networks meet the Neighborhood
Abstract:
Frequent updates and model retraining are important in various application areas of recommender systems, e.g., news recommendation. Moreover, in such domains, we may not only face the problem of dealing with a constant stream of new data, but also with anonymous users, leading to the problem of streaming session-based recommendation (SSR). Such problem settings have attracted increased interest in recent years, and different deep learning architectures were proposed that support fast updates of the underlying prediction models when new data arrive. In a recent paper, a method based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) was proposed as being superior than previous methods for the SSR problem. The baselines in the reported experiments included different machine learning models. However, several earlier studies have shown that often conceptually simpler methods, e.g., based on nearest neighbors, can be highly effective for session-based recommendation problems. In this work, we report a similar phenomenon for the streaming configuration. We first reproduce the results of the mentioned GNN method and then show that simpler methods are able to outperform this complex state-of-the-art neural method on two datasets. Overall, our work points to continued methodological issues in the academic community, e.g., in terms of the choice of baselines and reproducibility.1

Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about streaming session-based recommendation where graph neural networks meet the neighborhood. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Streaming Session-Based Recommendation&#34; and combines it with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) meeting the neighborhood. So right away, I know this is about recommendations in a streaming context, likely dealing with real-time data or frequent updates.

Looking at the abstract: It talks about frequent updates and model retraining important for recommender systems, especially in areas like news recommendation. That points to it being relevant in domains such as News. The problem they&#39;re addressing is streaming session-based recommendation (SSR), which involves handling anonymous users and a constant stream of new dataâ€”so this ties into the category &#34;Streaming Data.&#34;

They mention that different deep learning architectures have been proposed for fast model updates when new data arrives. So, this article is definitely related to Deep Learning. The specific method they discuss is based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which is a family of algorithms. Therefore, GNN falls under the algorithm category.

The abstract also compares GNN methods with simpler approaches like nearest neighbors and finds that these simpler models can outperform complex neural methods in streaming scenarios. This suggests that the article discusses Method Comparison, evaluating different techniques against each other.

Reproducibility is another key point they bring up, indicating issues within the academic community regarding baselines and reproducibility of results. So, this ties into categories like Reproducibility and Research Methodology.

The experiments were conducted on two datasets, which makes me think about Dataset Evaluation as a category. Additionally, since it&#39;s about recommendation systems, the main domain is Recommender Systems.

They mention that earlier studies showed simpler methods can be effective in session-based recommendations. So, this falls under Session-Based Recommendations.

Putting all these points together: The article discusses streaming data, uses GNNs as an algorithm, compares different methods, touches on reproducibility and research methodology, evaluates datasets, is within the realm of recommender systems, specifically session-based ones, and applies to domains like news. 

I should also consider if there are any real-world applications mentioned. The abstract doesn&#39;t explicitly talk about A/B tests or user surveys but does mention news recommendation as an application area, so maybe that&#39;s covered under News domain.

Now, I need to assign 8-12 categories. Let me list out what I have:

1. Graph Neural Networks (Algorithm)
2. Session-Based Recommendations
3. Streaming Data
4. Deep Learning
5. Recommender Systems
6. Reproducibility
7. Research Methodology
8. News Domain
9. Method Comparison
10. Dataset Evaluation

I think that&#39;s 10 categories, which fits the requirement.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. Let&#39;s start by reading through them carefully.

The title is &#34;Streaming Session-Based Recommendation: When Graph Neural Networks meet the Neighborhood.&#34; From this, I can tell it&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically streaming session-based recommendations. It mentions using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) in this context.

Looking at the abstract, the article discusses the importance of frequent updates and model retraining in areas like news recommendation. It points out that in such domains, there are challenges with anonymous users and constant data streams. The main focus is on streaming session-based recommendation (SSR), which has gained attention recently. Various deep learning architectures have been proposed to handle fast updates when new data arrives.

The paper mentions a GNN method being superior to previous methods for SSR. However, it also notes that simpler methods like nearest neighbors can be highly effective. The authors reproduce the GNN results and show that on two datasets, these simpler methods outperform the complex neural approach. They raise concerns about methodological issues in the academic community regarding baseline choices and reproducibility.

Now, I need to assign this article to multiple categories as per the guidelines. Let&#39;s break it down:

1. **Family of Algorithm**: The paper discusses Graph Neural Networks (GNN), so that should be a category. It also compares GNN with simpler methods like nearest neighbors, which is another family. So categories here would be &#34;Graph Neural Networks&#34; and &#34;Nearest Neighbors.&#34;

2. **Domain of the Problem**: The problem discussed is streaming session-based recommendation, which falls under recommendation systems. Also, since it&#39;s applied to news recommendation, that&#39;s a specific domain. So categories could be &#34;Recommendation Systems,&#34; &#34;Streaming,&#34; and &#34;News Recommendation.&#34;

3. **Specific Aspects in Recommendation Space**: The paper deals with the cold start problem because it handles anonymous users, leading to new sessions frequently. Therefore, &#34;Cold Start&#34; is another category.

4. **Evaluation Aspects**: The study evaluates different methods&#39; effectiveness and raises issues about reproducibility and baseline choices. So, categories like &#34;Methodological Issues,&#34; &#34;Reproducibility,&#34; and &#34;Evaluation Metrics.&#34;

5. **Real-World Applications**: It mentions real-world applications in news recommendation and the use of streaming data. So, categories here could be &#34;News&#34; and &#34;Streaming Data.&#34;

6. **Other Relevant Categories**: The paper discusses model updates and scalability since it&#39;s about handling frequent data streams and fast updates. Hence, &#34;Model Updates&#34; and &#34;Scalability&#34; are appropriate.

Putting it all together, I need to make sure each category is clear and relevant. Let me list them out:

- Graph Neural Networks
- Nearest Neighbors (as a simpler method)
- Streaming Session-Based Recommendation (specific problem area)
- Cold Start (since it deals with anonymous users)
- News Recommendation (domain application)
- Methodological Issues (academic concerns raised)
- Reproducibility (related to evaluation and methodology)
- Model Updates (frequent retraining mentioned)
- Scalability (handling data streams efficiently)
- Evaluation Metrics (discussing effectiveness of methods)
- Streaming Data (part of the problem context)

I should ensure each category is distinct and accurately reflects the content without overlapping too much. Also, checking that there are enough categories as per the guidelines (8-12). I think I have covered all necessary aspects without making any category too vague or too specific.
&lt;/think&gt;
