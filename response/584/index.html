Title: Are We Evaluating Rigorously? Benchmarking Recommendation for Reproducible Evaluation and Fair Comparison
Abstract:
With tremendous amount of recommendation algorithms proposed every year, one critical issue has attracted a considerable amount of attention: there are no effective benchmarks for evaluation, which leads to two major concerns, i.e., unreproducible evaluation and unfair comparison. This paper aims to conduct rigorous (i.e., reproducible and fair) evaluation for implicit-feedback based top-N recommendation algorithms. We first systematically review 85 recommendation papers published at eight top-tier conferences (e.g., RecSys, SIGIR) to summarize important evaluation factors, e.g., data splitting and parameter tuning strategies, etc. Through a holistic empirical study, the impacts of different factors on recommendation performance are then analyzed in-depth. Following that, we create benchmarks with standardized procedures and provide the performance of seven well-tuned state-of-the-arts across six metrics on six widely-used datasets as a reference for later study. Additionally, we release a user-friendly Python toolkit, which differs from existing ones in addressing the broad scope of rigorous evaluation for recommendation. Overall, our work sheds light on the issues in recommendation evaluation and lays the foundation for further investigation. Our code and datasets are available at GitHub (https://github.com/AmazingDD/daisyRec).

Alright, so I&#39;ve got this article to categorize. Let&#39;s break down what it&#39;s about.

The title is &#34;Are We Evaluating Rigorously? Benchmarking Recommendation for Reproducible Evaluation and Fair Comparison.&#34; That immediately tells me the focus is on evaluation methods in recommendation systems. The abstract mentions that there&#39;s a lack of effective benchmarks, leading to issues with reproducibility and fair comparisons. 

They reviewed 85 papers from top conferences like RecSys and SIGIR, looking at factors like data splitting and parameter tuning. Then they did an empirical study analyzing how these factors impact performance. They also created benchmarks with standardized procedures and tested seven state-of-the-art algorithms across six metrics on six datasets.

Additionally, they released a Python toolkit to help with rigorous evaluation, which is user-friendly and addresses a broad scope beyond existing tools. Their work aims to highlight issues in recommendation evaluation and provide a foundation for future research.

Now, considering the guidelines, I need to assign this article to 8-12 categories. Let me think about each relevant aspect.

First, the domain is clearly Recommender Systems since it&#39;s all about recommendation algorithms. The paper addresses methodological aspects by evaluating different factors and benchmarking, so Methodology is appropriate. They also talk about reproducibility, which ties into Reproducibility in Science.

Since they&#39;re dealing with benchmarks and evaluation procedures, Benchmarking and Evaluation Protocols are relevant. They specifically mention implicit feedback as the type of recommendation, so Implicit Feedback makes sense here.

The paper emphasizes the importance of standardized procedures for fair comparison, so Fairness in AI is another category. They also discuss performance metrics across different datasets, which relates to Performance Metrics.

Reproducible Research is a key theme because the paper focuses on making evaluations reproducible. The creation and release of a Python toolkit falls under Open Source Tools. Since they reviewed many studies, Literature Review is applicable.

They mention top-tier conferences like RecSys and SIGIR, so those could be categories too. Additionally, addressing evaluation rigor ties into Research Methodology.

I think that covers 12 categories, each relevant to the paper&#39;s content.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommender Systems, Methodology, Reproducibility in Science, Benchmarking, Evaluation Protocols, Implicit Feedback, Fairness in AI, Performance Metrics, Reproducible Research, Open Source Tools, Literature Review, RecSys, SIGIR, Research Methodology</code></pre>

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on the guidelines provided. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Are We Evaluating Rigorously? Benchmarking Recommendation for Reproducible Evaluation and Fair Comparison.&#34; The abstract mentions that they&#39;re focusing on implicit-feedback recommendation algorithms, discussing issues with evaluation benchmarks leading to unreproducible results and unfair comparisons. They review 85 papers, analyze evaluation factors like data splitting and parameter tuning, create standardized benchmarks, and provide a Python toolkit for others.

Alright, so the core themes here are around evaluating recommendation systems rigorously. They talk about reproducibility and fair comparison methods, which suggests categories related to evaluation practices. Since they&#39;re focusing on implicit feedback, that&#39;s an important aspect. Also, they mention using top-tier conferences like RecSys and SIGIR, so academic context is relevant.

They created benchmarks with standardized procedures, so benchmarking should be a category. They discuss different metrics and datasets, which ties into evaluation metrics. The release of a Python toolkit indicates practical applications or real-world implementations. Since the focus is on recommendation systems, that&#39;s a primary category.

Looking at the examples provided earlier, categories could include things like Evaluation Practices, Benchmarking, Implicit Feedback, Reproducibility, Fair Comparison, Academic Context, and maybe even Tools &amp; Frameworks because of the Python toolkit they released.

I should also consider aspects like data splitting strategies, parameter tuning, which are part of evaluation factors. They cover performance across various metrics and datasets, so Evaluation Metrics is another category. The paper&#39;s aim is to provide a foundation for further research, suggesting it has implications on Future Work as well.

Putting this together, I need at least 8-12 categories that accurately reflect these elements without overcrowding any single category. Let me list them out:

1. **Evaluation Practices**: Since the paper focuses on rigorous evaluation methods.
2. **Benchmarking**: They created standardized benchmarks for recommendation systems.
3. **Implicit Feedback**: The study is based on implicit feedback algorithms.
4. **Reproducibility**: Addressing issues in reproducible evaluations.
5. **Fair Comparison**: Ensuring comparisons between recommendation systems are fair.
6. **Recommendation Systems**: Core subject of the research.
7. **Academic Context**: Reviewing papers from top conferences, indicating an academic angle.
8. **Evaluation Metrics**: Discussing performance across multiple metrics.
9. **Tools &amp; Frameworks**: Release of a Python toolkit for others to use.
10. **Data Splitting Strategies**: Part of their evaluation factors analysis.
11. **Parameter Tuning**: Another aspect they reviewed and analyzed.
12. **Future Work Implications**: The paper lays the groundwork for further research.

I think these cover all the key aspects without being too specific or broad. They align with user needs as researchers looking into recommendation evaluations would find these categories useful. I should ensure each category is clear and descriptive to aid navigation effectively.
&lt;/think&gt;
