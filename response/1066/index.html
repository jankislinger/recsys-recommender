Title: SeCor: Aligning Semantic and Collaborative representations by Large Language Models for Next-Point-of-Interest Recommendations
Abstract:
The widespread adoption of location-based applications has created a growing demand for point-of-interest (POI) recommendation, which aims to predict a user’s next POI based on their historical check-in data and current location. However, existing methods often struggle to capture the intricate relationships within check-in data. This is largely due to their limitations in representing temporal and spatial information and underutilizing rich semantic features. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful semantic comprehension to solve them, they are limited by hallucination and the inability to incorporate global collaborative information. To address these issues, we propose a novel method SeCor, which treats POI recommendation as a multi-modal task and integrates semantic and collaborative representations to form an efficient hybrid encoding. SeCor first employs a basic collaborative filtering model to mine interaction features. These embeddings, as one modal information, are fed into LLM to align with semantic representation, leading to efficient hybrid embeddings. To mitigate the hallucination, SeCor recommends based on the hybrid embeddings rather than directly using the LLM’s output text. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that SeCor outperforms all baselines, achieving improved recommendation performance by effectively integrating collaborative and semantic information through LLMs.

Alright, I&#39;m looking at this research article about SeCor, which seems to focus on point-of-interest recommendations using large language models. Let me break down how I came up with the categories.

First, the title mentions &#34;Large Language Models,&#34; so that&#39;s a clear category. The method integrates semantic and collaborative representations, which points towards Hybrid Methods. It deals with POI recommendations specifically in location-based services, so that&#39;s another one.

The abstract talks about using multi-modal tasks by combining different data types—like interaction features (collaborative) and semantic embeddings from LLMs. That makes Multi-Modal a good fit. They also mention real-world applications with experiments on public datasets, so Real World Application is relevant.

I noticed they address issues like hallucination in LLMs and the need to incorporate global collaborative information. This ties into the Evaluation aspect of recommendation systems. The method&#39;s effectiveness suggests advancements in Algorithm Development, hence Recommender Systems.

The problem domain here is clearly Location-Based Services since it&#39;s about POI recommendations. They also talk about leveraging semantic features from text data, so Semantics is another category. Lastly, their experiments showing improved performance indicate successful A/B Testing or real-world deployment implications.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;SeCor: Aligning Semantic and Collaborative representations by Large Language Models for Next-Point-of-Interest Recommendations.&#34; So it&#39;s about POI recommendations using both semantic and collaborative methods with LLMs.

Looking at the abstract, the main focus is on point-of-interest recommendation systems. They mention challenges in capturing relationships within check-in data, particularly issues with temporal and spatial information, and underutilizing semantics. They propose a method called SeCor that uses large language models to integrate semantic and collaborative representations.

Key points from the abstract:
- POI recommendation
- Next-point-of-interest (next POI)
- Collaborative filtering model for interaction features
- Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic understanding
- Hybrid embeddings combining collaborative and semantic info
- Improved performance through effective integration

Now, I&#39;ll map these to possible categories. Let&#39;s consider the guidelines: assign at least 8-12 categories, balanced distribution, clear labels.

First category is obvious: POI Recommendation.

Next, since they use LLMs, that&#39;s another category: Large Language Models (LLMs).

They&#39;re combining semantic and collaborative approaches, so Semantic Representation and Collaborative Filtering are both relevant.

The problem involves next-point-of-interest, which suggests Next-POI Recommendations as a category.

Temporal and spatial information is important here, so Temporal Data and Spatial Data should be included.

Hybrid models that combine different techniques fit under Hybrid Recommendation Models.

They mention experiments on real-world datasets, so Real-World Applications is relevant.

The article also deals with integrating collaborative and semantic info, which I can note as Collaborative-Semantic Integration.

Another point is the use of check-in data, so Check-In Data is a category.

Performance improvement is mentioned, so Recommendation Performance could be another.

They talk about handling complex relationships in check-in data, so maybe User Behavior Analysis or something similar. Let me think: maybe User Trajectory since it&#39;s about next points and movement.

Also, the method involves both collaborative filtering and LLMs, which are two different approaches, so Multi-Modal Recommendations might fit as well.

Wait, but I have to list at least 8 categories, so let&#39;s see:

1. POI Recommendation
2. Large Language Models (LLMs)
3. Semantic Representation
4. Collaborative Filtering
5. Next-POI Recommendations
6. Temporal Data
7. Spatial Data
8. Hybrid Recommendation Models

That&#39;s 8. Maybe add more relevant ones.

They mention experiments on real-world datasets, so Real-World Applications is a good addition (9).

Also, the method involves embedding techniques, specifically hybrid embeddings, so maybe something like Hybrid Embeddings or just keep it under Hybrid models.

But I think I have enough with these. Let me count:

1. POI Recommendation
2. Large Language Models (LLMs)
3. Semantic Representation
4. Collaborative Filtering
5. Next-POI Recommendations
6. Temporal Data
7. Spatial Data
8. Hybrid Recommendation Models
9. Real-World Applications

Wait, that&#39;s only 9. Maybe add two more.

Check-In Data is another relevant category (10). Also, since they talk about integrating different representations, perhaps Representation Learning as a broader category (11). Or maybe something like User Behavior Analysis (since it deals with check-ins and next POI).

Alternatively, maybe include the specific problem area: Location-Based Recommendations or Geolocation.

But I should stick to the categories suggested in the examples. Let me cross-check:

Examples given were things like Family of algorithm (Matrix Factorization, Encoder, etc.), Domain (Books, Movies, Healthcare), specific recommendation aspects (Cold Start), evaluation aspects, real-world applications (A/B Test, User Survey).

So perhaps:

- Algorithm family: Collaborative Filtering, LLMs
- Domain: POI Recommendations, Next-POI
- Specific aspects: Semantic Representation, Hybrid Models
- Real-world applications: since they used datasets.

Alternatively, maybe add categories like Location-Based Systems or Geospatial Data.

But to stick with the examples given, perhaps:

- Family of Algorithm: Collaborative Filtering, Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Domain: Point-of-Interest (POI) Recommendation, Next-Point-of-Interest (Next-POI)
- Specific aspects: Semantic Representation
- Real-world applications: Experiments on real datasets

But I need to list 8-12 categories. So let&#39;s structure them accordingly.

Final list:

1. POI Recommendation
2. Collaborative Filtering
3. Large Language Models (LLMs)
4. Next-POI Recommendations
5. Semantic Representation
6. Hybrid Recommendation Models
7. Temporal Data
8. Spatial Data
9. Real-World Applications
10. Check-In Data
11. User Trajectory

Wait, that&#39;s 11 categories. Alternatively, maybe include something like Scalability or Efficiency if mentioned, but the abstract doesn&#39;t focus on that. Alternatively, maybe Representation Learning.

But I think the main ones are covered above.
&lt;/think&gt;

POI Recommendation, Collaborative Filtering, Large Language Models (LLMs), Next-POI Recommendations, Semantic Representation, Hybrid Recommendation Models, Temporal Data, Spatial Data, Real-World Applications, Check-In Data, User Trajectory</code></pre>
