        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Fast and Examination-agnostic Reciprocal Recommendation in Matching Markets
Abstract:
n matching markets such as job posting and online dating platforms, the recommender system plays a critical role in the success of the platform. Unlike standard recommender systems that suggest items to users, reciprocal recommender systems (RRSs) that suggest other users must take into account the mutual interests of users. In addition, ensuring that recommendation opportunities do not disproportionately favor popular users is essential for the total number of matches and for fairness among users. Existing recommendation methods in matching markets, however, face computational challenges on large-scale platforms and depend on specific examination functions in the position-based model (PBM). In this paper, we introduce the reciprocal recommendation method based on the matching with transferable utility (TU matching) model in the context of ranking recommendations in matching markets and propose a fast and examination-model-free algorithm. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach on experiments with synthetic data and real-world data from an online dating platform in Japan. Our method performs better than or as well as existing methods in terms of the number of total matches and works well even in a large-scale dataset for which one existing method does not work.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by understanding what the article is about.

The title mentions &#34;Fast and Examination-agnostic Reciprocal Recommendation in Matching Markets.&#34; So, it&#39;s about reciprocal recommendation systems (RRSs) used in matching markets like job platforms or online dating. The key points from the title are that it&#39;s fast, examination-agnostic (meaning it doesn&#39;t rely on specific functions for user responses), and focuses on reciprocal recommendations.

Looking at the abstract, it explains that in these matching markets, RRSs have to consider mutual interests between users, unlike standard recommenders which suggest items. There&#39;s a focus on computational efficiency, especially for large-scale platforms, and avoiding favoring popular users to ensure fairness and maximize matches.

The article introduces a method based on TU (transferable utility) matching models and proposes an algorithm that&#39;s both fast and doesn&#39;t depend on specific examination functions in the Position-Based Model (PBM). They tested it with synthetic data and real-world data from an online dating platform in Japan, showing better performance than existing methods.

Now, I need to map this into categories. Starting with the family of algorithms: they use TU matching models, which is a type of algorithm for reciprocal recommendations. So that&#39;s one category.

The domain here is clearly matching markets, specifically job platforms and online dating. So another category is &#34;Matching Markets.&#34;

In terms of specific recommendation aspects, it&#39;s about reciprocal recommendations since it&#39;s suggesting users to each other, so &#34;Reciprocal Recommendation&#34; should be included.

They address fairness in the system by not favoring popular users, ensuring a balanced number of matches. So &#34;Fairness&#34; is an important category.

The evaluation aspect includes comparing their method against existing ones using metrics like total matches and scalability. They also mention beyond accuracy metrics, so &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; as one of the aspects they evaluate.

They tested with synthetic data and real-world data from an online dating platform in Japan. Using real-world applications shows that they&#39;ve applied their method in a practical setting, hence &#34;Real-World Applications.&#34;

The algorithm is designed to be scalable for large datasets, which was a problem with existing methods. So &#34;Scalability&#34; should be another category.

They proposed a new approach, so &#34;Algorithmic Innovation&#34; fits here as well.

Since it&#39;s a recommendation method in matching markets, the primary domain is &#34;Recommendation Systems.&#34; That&#39;s a broad category but necessary for discoverability.

Lastly, the problem they&#39;re tackling is ensuring that the recommendations don&#39;t disproportionately favor certain users, which ties into fairness and balance. So another aspect could be &#34;Balance&#34; in recommendations.

Putting it all together, the categories should cover these aspects: the algorithm used (TU Matching Model), domain (Matching Markets), specific recommendation type (Reciprocal Recommendation), evaluation metrics (Beyond Accuracy), real-world testing (Real-World Applications), scalability, fairness, innovation, and the broader recommendation systems. That gives us a comprehensive set of categories that align with both the content and user needs for discoverability.
&lt;/think&gt;
