Title: A Low-Code Tool Supporting the Development of Recommender Systems
Abstract:
The design of recommender systems (RSs) to support software development encompasses the fulfillment of different steps, including data preprocessing, choice of the most appropriate algorithms, item delivery. Though RSs can alleviate the curse of information overload, existing approaches resemble black-box systems, in which the end-user is not expected to fine-tune or personalize the overall process.
In this work, we propose LEV4REC, a low-code environment to assist developers in designing, configuring, and delivering recommender systems. The first step supported by the proposed tool includes defining an initial model that allows for the configuration of the crucial components of the wanted RS. Then, a subsequent phase is performed to finalize the RS design, e.g., to specify configuration parameters. LEV4REC is eventually capable of generating source code for the desired RS. To evaluate the capabilities of the approach, we used LEV4REC to specify two existing RSs built on top of two different recommendation algorithms, i.e., collaborative filtering and supervised machine learning.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about a low-code tool for recommender systems. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;A Low-Code Tool Supporting the Development of Recommender Systems.&#34; The abstract talks about designing RSs with steps like data preprocessing, choosing algorithms, and item delivery. It mentions that existing systems are black-box, but their tool, LEV4REC, helps developers design, configure, and deliver RSs by generating source code.

So, first, I should note the main themes: recommender systems, low-code tools, development support, collaborative filtering, machine learning. The tool seems to assist in building RSs without needing extensive coding, so that&#39;s a key point.

Looking at the example categories provided, they include things like algorithms (e.g., Matrix Factorization), domains (Books, Movies), specific recommendation topics (Cold Start), evaluation aspects (Diversity), real-world applications (A/B Test), and other relevant types.

Let me break down the article into parts:

1. **Recommender Systems**: Definitely a primary category since that&#39;s the focus.
2. **Low-Code Development**: Since it&#39;s about a tool that helps build RSs without heavy coding.
3. **Collaborative Filtering**: Mentioned as one of the algorithms used in examples.
4. **Supervised Machine Learning**: Another algorithm mentioned, so this is relevant.
5. **Algorithm Selection**: The tool assists in choosing appropriate algorithms.
6. **Software Development Tools**: Since LEV4REC is a tool for RS development.
7. **Code Generation**: Because it generates source code for RSs.
8. **System Design**: Involves designing and configuring RS components.

I should make sure each category aligns with the article&#39;s content without being too narrow or broad. The user also mentioned considering aspects like scalability, evaluation metrics, etc., but this article doesn&#39;t delve into those. So I&#39;ll stick to what&#39;s explicitly covered.

Also, considering the guidelines: assign 8-12 categories. Let me see if I can find more relevant ones:

9. **Configuration Management**: Since it involves configuring RS parameters.
10. **User-Centric Design**: The tool is meant for developers, which are users here.

Wait, maybe &#34;Development Support&#34; as a broader category? Or perhaps &#34;Automation in Development&#34; since the tool automates code generation.

I should also think about whether there&#39;s any mention of real-world applications beyond evaluation. The abstract says they used LEV4REC to specify existing RSs but doesn&#39;t describe specific deployments or user studies, so maybe not A/B Test or User Survey here.

Another thought: &#34;Tooling for Developers&#34; as a category could be relevant since it&#39;s aimed at developers.

Let me list out the categories I&#39;ve identified:

- Recommender Systems
- Low-Code Development
- Collaborative Filtering
- Supervised Machine Learning
- Algorithm Selection
- Software Development Tools
- Code Generation
- System Design
- Configuration Management
- User-Centric Design
- Tooling for Developers

Wait, that&#39;s more than 12. Let me check which ones are the most relevant and essential.

The core aspects are Recommender Systems, Low-Code Development, Collaborative Filtering, Supervised Machine Learning, Algorithm Selection, Software Development Tools, Code Generation, System Design. That&#39;s eight categories. I think these capture the main points without being redundant.

I could consider adding Configuration Management as it&#39;s part of the tool&#39;s functionality. So that makes nine. But maybe that&#39;s a bit too specific. Alternatively, I can stick with the broader terms to ensure each category is sufficiently populated for navigation purposes.

Alternatively, perhaps &#34;Tooling&#34; or &#34;Development Tools&#34; would be better than specific categories like Configuration Management.

Hmm, the example given in the user message included categories like Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization), Domain of problem, Specific recommendation space, etc. So maybe I should focus on aligning with those structures.

So, focusing on the family of algorithms: Collaborative Filtering and Supervised Machine Learning are both algorithm families covered. Then, under development support, Low-Code Development is a specific tool aspect.

So, consolidating:

Recommender Systems, Algorithm Selection, Collaborative Filtering, Supervised Machine Learning, Low-Code Development, Software Development Tools, Code Generation, System Design.

That&#39;s eight categories. I think this covers the main points without overcomplicating.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about a low-code tool for recommender systems. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;A Low-Code Tool Supporting the Development of Recommender Systems.&#34; So right away, I know it&#39;s related to both low-code platforms and recommendation systems. That gives me two potential categories: Low-Code Tools and Recommender Systems.

Looking at the abstract, the article talks about designing recommender systems through various steps like data preprocessing, algorithm selection, item delivery. It mentions that existing RSs are often black-box systems where users can&#39;t personalize the process. The proposed tool, LEV4REC, helps developers design, configure, and deliver these systems by generating source code.

LEV4REC supports defining an initial model for configuration and then finalizing the RS with specific parameters. They evaluated it using collaborative filtering and supervised machine learning algorithms. So I see that they&#39;re discussing algorithm selection, which points to Algorithm Selection as a category.

Also, since the tool is about development, it&#39;s probably part of Development Tools in Recommender Systems. Additionally, the abstract mentions generating source code, which makes me think of Code Generation as another relevant category.

The article is also an example of applying low-code in a specific domain (recommender systems), so Low-Code Platforms is definitely applicable. Since it&#39;s about developing RSs through this tool, Recommender Systems Development should be included.

Now, looking at the guidelines, I need to assign 8-12 categories. Let me think if there are more relevant ones. The abstract mentions collaborative filtering and supervised machine learning, which are specific algorithms, so those should each get their own categories as they&#39;re part of the evaluation.

The tool seems focused on assisting in the design phase, which could relate to Design Automation. Also, because it&#39;s a low-code environment that makes RS development more accessible, maybe Democratizing Technology is relevant here.

I think I have enough categories now. Let me make sure they are clear and descriptive. They should cover all aspects mentioned: the tool itself, the domain (recommender systems), specific algorithms used, development aspects, code generation, and low-code applications.
&lt;/think&gt;

Algorithm Selection, Recommender Systems, Collaborative Filtering, Low-Code Tools, Code Generation, Development Tools, Supervised Machine Learning, Design Automation, Item Delivery, Democratizing Technology</code></pre>
