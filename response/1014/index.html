        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Visual Representation for Capturing Creator Theme in Brand-Creator Marketplace
Abstract:
Providing cold start recommendations in a brand-creator marketplace is challenging as brands’ preferences extend beyond the mere objects depicted in the creator’s content and encompass the creator’s individual theme consistently resonates across images shared on her social media profile. Furthermore, brands often use textual keywords to describe their campaign’s aesthetic appeal, with which creators must align. To address these challenges, we propose two methods: SAME (Same Account Media Embedding), a novel creator representation employing a Siamese network to capture the unique creator theme and OAAR (Object-Agnostic Adjective Representation), enabling filtering creators based on textual adjectives that relate to aesthetic qualities through zero-shot learning. These two methods utilize CLIP, a state-of-the-art language-image model, and improve it in addressing the aforementioned challenges.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories. Let me read through the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Visual Representation for Capturing Creator Theme in Brand-Creator Marketplace.&#34; The abstract talks about cold start recommendations in a brand-creator marketplace. Brands&#39; preferences go beyond just the objects in creators&#39; content; they look at the creator&#39;s theme across images on their social media. Brands use textual keywords for their campaign aesthetics, and creators need to align with those.

The article proposes two methods: SAME (Same Account Media Embedding) using a Siamese network to capture creator themes, and OAAR (Object-Agnostic Adjective Representation) for filtering creators based on adjectives related to aesthetic qualities through zero-shot learning. They use CLIP, which is a state-of-the-art language-image model.

So, breaking this down:

1. **Cold Start**: This is a key term mentioned in the abstract, so that&#39;s definitely a category.
2. **Recommendation Systems**: The article is about providing recommendations in a marketplace.
3. **Visual Representation**: It&#39;s about capturing themes visually, so this fits.
4. **Creator Themes**: Specific to understanding creator styles across media.
5. **Brand-creator Marketplace**: This is the specific domain they&#39;re working in.
6. **Aesthetic Alignment**: Brands use keywords for aesthetics, and creators need to align with that.
7. **Zero-shot Learning**: OAAR uses this approach for filtering based on adjectives.
8. **Textual Adjectives**: The methods involve using text-based descriptors related to aesthetics.
9. **CLIP (Language-Image Model)**: They&#39;re enhancing CLIP, so this is relevant.
10. **Siamese Networks**: SAME method uses this network architecture.

I should also consider broader categories that might apply here:

- **Marketplace Optimization**: Since it&#39;s about improving recommendations in a marketplace.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: As they&#39;re focusing on creator content and themes.
- **Social Media Analysis**: The creators&#39; social media profiles are analyzed for themes.
- **Cross-domain Recommendations**: Combining visual and textual information from different domains.

Wait, the example categories include things like Family of algorithm, Domain of problem, specific recommendation aspects, evaluation aspects, real-world applications. Let me see if I missed any:

- Algorithms used: Siamese network is one, but maybe more specifically under &#34;Siamese Networks.&#34;
- The domain is brand-creator marketplace.
- Specific recommendation aspect: cold start and aesthetic alignment.
- Evaluation might not be explicitly mentioned here, but the methods involve real-world applications like A/B testing or user surveys? Not sure if that&#39;s covered in this abstract. Maybe I should include it as a possible category.

Also, considering the use of CLIP, which is a language-image model, so that&#39;s an existing algorithm family.

So compiling all these points into categories:

1. **Cold Start**: Directly mentioned.
2. **Recommendation Systems**: General area.
3. **Visual Representation**: Focus on visual themes.
4. **Creator Themes**: Specific aspect of creators&#39; consistent themes.
5. **Brand-Creator Marketplace**: Domain-specific.
6. **Aesthetic Alignment**: Aligning creator content with brand aesthetics using textual keywords.
7. **Zero-shot Learning**: Method used in OAAR.
8. **Textual Adjectives**: Descriptors for aesthetic qualities.
9. **CLIP (Language-Image Model)**: Algorithm family they&#39;re enhancing.
10. **Siamese Networks**: Specific algorithm used in SAME method.

Additional categories could be:

11. **Marketplace Optimization**: Improving the marketplace through recommendations.
12. **Content-Based Filtering**: Using creator content to filter and recommend.
13. **Social Media Analysis**: Analyzing creators&#39; social media for themes.
14. **Cross-domain Recommendations**: Combining visual and textual data.

But I need to ensure each category is clear and user-friendly, without overlapping too much. Maybe &#34;Marketplace Optimization&#34; can be part of the domain or as a separate aspect. Similarly, &#34;Content-Based Filtering&#34; is more about the approach.

Let me list them out clearly:

- Cold Start
- Recommendation Systems
- Visual Representation
- Creator Themes
- Brand-Creator Marketplace
- Aesthetic Alignment
- Zero-shot Learning
- Textual Adjectives
- CLIP (Language-Image Model)
- Siamese Networks
- Marketplace Optimization
- Content-Based Filtering
- Social Media Analysis
- Cross-domain Recommendations

But I need to make sure that each category is distinct and relevant. Maybe &#34;Marketplace Optimization&#34; can be more specific, but it might be better as a broader category. Alternatively, maybe not necessary if another category covers the same ground.

I think 8-12 categories are needed. Let me prioritize based on relevance:

The most critical ones from the abstract would be:

Cold Start (key challenge addressed)
Recommendation Systems
Visual Representation
Creator Themes
Brand-Creator Marketplace
Aesthetic Alignment
Zero-shot Learning
Textual Adjectives
CLIP (Language-Image Model)
Siamese Networks

That&#39;s 10 categories. Adding more could make it too granular, but perhaps a few more to cover aspects like the methods used or application areas.

Alternatively, considering the user-centric design, &#34;Content-Based Filtering&#34; and &#34;Cross-domain Recommendations&#34; might be useful for users looking into specific recommendation techniques.

So final list:

- Cold Start
- Recommendation Systems
- Visual Representation
- Creator Themes
- Brand-Creator Marketplace
- Aesthetic Alignment
- Zero-shot Learning
- Textual Adjectives
- CLIP (Language-Image Model)
- Siamese Networks
- Content-Based Filtering
- Cross-domain Recommendations

That&#39;s 12 categories, which fits the guideline. I think this covers all aspects mentioned in the abstract and aligns with user interests in recommendation systems, algorithms used, and specific application domains.
&lt;/think&gt;

Cold Start, Recommendation Systems, Visual Representation, Creator Themes, Brand-Creator Marketplace, Aesthetic Alignment, Zero-shot Learning, Textual Adjectives, CLIP (Language-Image Model), Siamese Networks, Content-Based Filtering, Cross-domain Recommendations</code></pre>
