        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Doubly Robust Estimator for Ranking Metrics with Post-Click Conversions
Abstract:
Post-click conversion, a pre-defined action on a web service after a click, is an essential form of feedback, as it directly contributes to the final revenue and accurately captures user preferences for items, compared with the ambiguous click. However, naively using post-click conversions can lead to severe bias when learning or evaluating recommenders because of the selection bias between clicked and unclicked data. In this study, we address the offline evaluation problem of algorithmic recommendations with biased post-click conversions. A possible solution to address this bias is to use the inverse propensity score estimator, as it can provide an unbiased evaluation even with the selection bias. However, this estimator is known to be subject to variance and instability problems, which can be severe in the recommendation setting, as feedback is often highly sparse. To address these limitations with the previous unbiased estimator, we propose a doubly robust estimator for the ground-truth ranking performance of a given recommender. The proposed estimator is unbiased against the ground-truth ranking metric and improves the variance and estimation error tail bound of the existing unbiased estimator. Finally, to evaluate the empirical efficacy of the proposed estimator, we conduct empirical evaluations using semi-synthetic and two public real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed metric reveals a better model evaluation performance compared with existing baseline metrics, particularly in a situation with severe selection bias.

Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about a Doubly Robust Estimator for Ranking Metrics with Post-Click Conversions. Let me go through the steps as per the guidelines.

First, I&#39;ll read the title and abstract carefully. The title mentions &#34;Doubly Robust Estimator&#34; which sounds like a statistical or machine learning method. The focus is on ranking metrics and post-click conversions, so it&#39;s related to recommendation systems.

Looking at the abstract, they discuss the importance of post-click conversions in accurately capturing user preferences and contributing to revenue. They mention that using these conversions naively can lead to selection bias when evaluating recommenders. So, this ties into evaluation methods and bias correction in recommendations.

The solution proposed is a doubly robust estimator, which improves upon the inverse propensity score method by addressing variance issues. This indicates they&#39;re discussing algorithm improvements or corrections for bias in recommendation metrics.

They also talk about empirical evaluations using semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, so there&#39;s an element of experimentation and evaluation metrics here. The article seems to focus on providing a better way to evaluate recommenders, especially when dealing with biased data.

Now, mapping this to the categories:

1. **Bias Correction**: Since they&#39;re addressing selection bias in recommendation evaluation.
2. **Conversion Rate**: Post-click conversions are a key metric discussed.
3. **Recommendation Systems**: The main domain is recommendations.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: They propose a new estimator for evaluating metrics.
5. **Click Behavior**: Deals with post-click actions and their implications.
6. **Selection Bias**: Directly mentioned as a problem addressed.
7. **Propensity Score Methods**: Inverse propensity scoring is discussed, so this category fits.
8. **Metric Robustness**: The estimator is doubly robust, emphasizing robust metrics.
9. **Algorithmic Recommendations**: Focus on evaluating algorithms.
10. **Empirical Evaluation**: They conduct evaluations with real data.

I should ensure these categories are relevant and align with the guidelines of being specific yet broad enough. Also, each category should have enough related articles to be useful for navigation. I think these cover both the methodological aspects (like bias correction, propensity scores) and the application in recommendation systems along with evaluation metrics.
&lt;/think&gt;
