        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-Behaviour Contrastive Learning for Effective Recommendation
Abstract:
Real-world recommendation scenarios usually need to handle diverse user-item interaction behaviours, including page views, adding items into carts, and purchasing activities. The interactions that precede the actual target behaviour (e.g. purchasing an item) allow to better capture the user’s preferences from different angles, and are used  as auxiliary information (e.g. page views) to enrich the system’s knowledge about the users’ preferences, thereby helping to enhance recommendation for the target behaviour. Despite efforts in modelling the users’ multi-behaviour interaction information, the existing multi-behaviour recommenders  still face two challenges: (1) Data sparsity across multiple user behaviours is a common issue that limits the recommendation performance, particularly for the target behaviour, which typically exhibits fewer interactions compared to other auxiliary behaviours. (2) Noisy auxiliary interactive behaviour where the information in the auxiliary information  might be non-relevant to recommendation.  In this case, a direct  adoption of  contrastive learning between the target behaviour and the auxiliary behaviours will amplify the noise in the auxiliary behaviours, thereby negatively impacting the real semantics that can be derived from the target behaviour. To address these two challenges, we propose a new model called Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-behaviour Contrastive Learning for Recommendation (KEMCL). In particular, to address the problem of sparse user multi-behaviour interaction information, we leverage a tailored knowledge graph (KG) to enrich the semantic representations of items, and generate supervision signals through self-supervised learning so as to enhance  recommendation. In addition, we develop two contrastive learning (CL) methods, inter CL and intra CL, to alleviate the problem of noisy auxiliary interactions. Extensive experiments on three public recommendation datasets show that our proposed KEMCL model significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In particular, our KEMCL model outperforms the best baseline performance, namely KMCLR,  by 5.42% on the large Tmall dataset.

Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-Behaviour Contrastive Learning for Effective Recommendation. Let me go through it step by step.

First, looking at the title and abstract, the main focus is on recommendation systems, specifically using contrastive learning with multiple user behaviors like page views, cart additions, and purchases. So I&#39;ll note down &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; as a primary category.

The article mentions handling diverse interaction behaviors, so that points to &#34;User Interaction.&#34; They use auxiliary information from these interactions to improve recommendations, which relates to &#34;Auxiliary Information.&#34;

Data sparsity is one of the challenges addressed here. The target behavior (like purchasing) has fewer interactions compared to others, so &#34;Data Sparsity&#34; is another category.

Another challenge is dealing with noisy auxiliary data. This means they&#39;re addressing issues where some behaviors might not be relevant. So &#34;Noisy Data&#34; fits here.

They use contrastive learning methods—both inter and intra CL—to handle these challenges. Therefore, &#34;Contrastive Learning&#34; should definitely be included.

The method involves a knowledge graph (KG) to enrich item representations, so &#34;Knowledge Graphs&#34; is another category.

They also talk about self-supervised learning as part of their approach, which adds to the categories with &#34;Self-Supervised Learning.&#34;

The experiments were conducted on public datasets like Tmall, indicating real-world applications. So &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; makes sense here.

Since they improved upon existing methods and showed significant performance gains, especially against KMCLR on the Tmall dataset, &#34;Performance Improvement&#34; should be included.

Lastly, the broader application of these recommendation techniques can be seen in e-commerce contexts, so &#34;E-Commerce&#34; is a fitting category as well.

Putting it all together, I think these categories cover the article&#39;s main points and align with user interests in recommendation systems and related technologies.
&lt;/think&gt;
