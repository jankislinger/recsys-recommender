        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Scaling recommendation infrastructure for local applications: Enabling a self-service culture for data driven decisions within the most global brewer
Abstract:
Within decentralized organizations, the local demand for recommender systems to support business processes grows. The diversity in data sources and infrastructure challenges central engineering teams. Achieving a high delivery velocity without technical debt requires a scalable approach in the development and operations of recommender systems. At the HEINEKEN Company, we execute a machine learning operations method with five best practices: pipeline automation, data availability, exchangeable artifacts, observability, and policy-based security. Creating a culture of self-service, automation, and collaboration to scale recommender systems for decentralization. We demonstrate a practical use case of a self-service ML workspace deployment and a recommender system, that scale faster to subsidiaries and with less technical debt. This enables HEINEKEN to globally support applications that generate insights with local business impact.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on the guidelines provided. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Scaling recommendation infrastructure for local applications: Enabling a self-service culture for data driven decisions within the most global brewer.&#34; This suggests that the article is about scaling recommendation systems, particularly within a large company like HEINEKEN. It mentions enabling a self-service culture, which implies aspects of machine learning operations (MLOps) and decentralization.

Looking at the abstract, it talks about decentralized organizations where local demand for recommender systems is growing. The challenges include diverse data sources and infrastructure issues that central engineering teams face. The solution presented involves a machine learning operations method with five best practices: pipeline automation, data availability, exchangeable artifacts, observability, and policy-based security. They created a culture of self-service, automation, and collaboration to scale recommender systems for decentralization. There&#39;s also a practical use case involving a self-service ML workspace deployment and a recommender system that scales faster to subsidiaries with less technical debt.

So, the key themes here are:
1. Recommender Systems
2. Scaling Infrastructure
3. Decentralized Organizations
4. MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)
5. Pipeline Automation
6. Data Availability
7. Exchangeable Artifacts
8. Observability
9. Policy-Based Security
10. Self-Service Culture
11. Technical Debt Management
12. Practical Use Cases

Now, mapping these to the examples provided:
- Family of algorithms: Not directly mentioned, but MLOps is more about operations than specific algorithms.
- Domain of the problem: This is in a business context, possibly within the beverage industry (brewer), so maybe &#34;Business Applications&#34; or &#34;Enterprise Solutions.&#34;
- Specific recommendation aspects: The focus isn&#39;t on the recommendation algorithm itself but on scaling and infrastructure, so perhaps &#34;Recommendation Infrastructure&#34; or &#34;Decentralized Recommendations.&#34;
- Evaluation aspects: Not directly discussed; instead, it&#39;s about operational efficiency.
- Real-world applications: Yes, they have a practical use case within HEINEKEN.

Also considering user-centric design, categories like &#34;Self-Service ML,&#34; &#34;Automation in ML,&#34; and &#34;Scalability&#34; are important because users might be looking for how to implement scalable systems or self-service solutions.

I should ensure each article is placed in at least 8-12 categories. Let&#39;s list out the potential categories based on the above analysis:

1. Recommender Systems
2. Scaling Infrastructure
3. Decentralized Organizations
4. MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)
5. Pipeline Automation
6. Data Availability
7. Observability
8. Policy-Based Security
9. Self-Service Culture
10. Technical Debt Management
11. Practical Use Cases
12. Enterprise Solutions
13. Business Applications

Wait, that&#39;s 13 categories, but I need to make sure they are distinct and relevant. Let me check if any of these can be combined or if some are too specific.

- &#34;Decentralized Organizations&#34; could also relate to &#34;Decentralization.&#34;
- &#34;MLOps&#34; is a broad category encompassing several aspects like pipeline automation, data availability, observability.
- &#34;Self-Service Culture&#34; might fit under &#34;Automation in ML&#34; or &#34;Self-Service ML Workspaces.&#34;

But according to the guidelines, each article should be placed in at least 8-12 categories. So maybe I can include some broader and more specific ones.

Possible categories:

- Recommender Systems (core topic)
- Scaling Infrastructure
- Decentralization
- MLOps
- Pipeline Automation
- Data Availability
- Observability
- Policy-Based Security
- Self-Service ML Workspaces
- Technical Debt Management
- Practical Use Cases

That&#39;s 11 categories. I think this covers the main aspects without being too redundant. Let me make sure each category is clear and user-friendly.

Alternatively, to align more with the examples given:

- Domain: &#34;Enterprise Solutions&#34; or &#34;Business Applications&#34;
- Specific recommendation aspect: &#34;Recommendation Infrastructure,&#34; &#34;Decentralized Recommendations&#34;
- MLOps components: &#34;Pipeline Automation,&#34; &#34;Data Availability,&#34; &#34;Observability,&#34; &#34;Policy-Based Security&#34;
- Culture and practices: &#34;Self-Service Culture,&#34; &#34;Technical Debt Management&#34;

I think that&#39;s a solid list. I&#39;ll proceed with these categories.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommender Systems, Scaling Infrastructure, Decentralization, MLOps, Pipeline Automation, Data Availability, Observability, Policy-Based Security, Self-Service ML Workspaces, Technical Debt Management, Practical Use Cases, Enterprise Solutions</code></pre>
