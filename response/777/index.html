        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Solving Diversity-Aware Maximum Inner Product Search Efficiently and Effectively
Abstract:
Maximum inner product search (or k-MIPS) is a fundamental operation in recommender systems that infer preferable items for users. To support large-scale recommender systems, existing studies designed scalable k-MIPS algorithms. However, these studies do not consider diversity, although recommending diverse items is important to improve user satisfaction. We therefore formulate a new problem, namely diversity-aware k-MIPS. In this problem, users can control the degree of diversity in their recommendation lists through a parameter. However, exactly solving this problem is unfortunately NP-hard, so it is challenging to devise an efficient, effective, and practical algorithm for the diversity-aware k-MIPS problem. This paper overcomes this challenge and proposes IP-Greedy, which incorporates new early termination and skipping techniques into a greedy algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets, and the results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm. Also, we conduct a case study of the diversity-aware k-MIPS problem on a real dataset. We confirm that this problem can make recommendation lists diverse while preserving high inner products of user and item vectors in the lists.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about solving Diversity-Aware Maximum Inner Product Search efficiently. The title already gives me some clues. It mentions &#34;Diversity-Aware&#34; which makes me think it&#39;s related to recommendation systems where diversity is important for user satisfaction.

Looking at the abstract, they talk about Maximum Inner Product Search (k-MIPS) being a fundamental operation in recommender systems. So that definitely ties into recommendation algorithms. They mention existing studies have scalable k-MIPS algorithms but lack consideration for diversity. This tells me this article is addressing a gap in current methods by incorporating diversity.

The problem formulated here is called diversity-aware k-MIPS, allowing users to control the degree of diversity through a parameter. That sounds like it&#39;s about user customization or personalization in recommendations. The authors propose an algorithm called IP-Greedy with early termination and skipping techniques. So this involves algorithm design and optimization.

They conducted experiments on real datasets and a case study, which means they have practical applications and evaluations. This suggests the article has empirical evaluation and real-world testing.

Considering the categories I need to assign: it&#39;s definitely in recommendation systems as that&#39;s the main area. It deals with algorithms, specifically focusing on inner product search, so &#34;Maximum Inner Product Search&#34; is a relevant category. The focus on diversity leads me to &#34;Diversity of Recommendations.&#34; They also talk about efficiency and effectiveness, which ties into algorithm performance.

The study introduces a new problem formulation (diversity-aware), so that&#39;s another category. Early termination techniques are part of their solution, adding another aspect. It touches on scalability since existing studies aimed for scalable solutions, so that&#39;s important too. The case study and experiments mean it has real-world applications.

I should also consider user-centric aspects since diversity is about improving user satisfaction. Evaluation metrics like inner products being preserved while maintaining diversity tie into evaluation criteria beyond just accuracy. So &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; makes sense here.

Putting this all together, the categories should cover recommendation systems, algorithms related to maximum inner product search, diversity in recommendations, algorithm efficiency and design, scalability, problem formulation, evaluation aspects, real-world applications, user-centric design, and customizability. I think that&#39;s a comprehensive set based on the article&#39;s content.
&lt;/think&gt;
