        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: System U: Automatically Deriving Personality Traits from Social Media for People Recommendation
Abstract:
This paper presents a system, System U, which automatically derives people&#39;s personality traits from social media and recommends people for different tasks. The system leverages linguistic signals appearing in a person&#39;s social media activities to compute the personality portraits including Big Five personality, fundamental needs and basic human values. This system and technology can be used in a wide variety of personalized applications, such as recommending people to answer questions.

Alright, let me try to categorize this article step by step. The title is &#34;System U: Automatically Deriving Personality Traits from Social Media for People Recommendation.&#34; From the title alone, I gather that the paper discusses a system that uses social media data to determine personality traits and then applies this information to recommend people for various tasks.

Looking at the abstract, it explains that System U analyzes linguistic signals in social media activities to create detailed personality profiles. These profiles include aspects like the Big Five personality traits, fundamental needs, and basic human values. The applications mentioned are personalized, such as recommending individuals to answer questions, which suggests it&#39;s aimed at matching people effectively for tasks.

Now, I need to map this to relevant categories based on the guidelines provided. First, considering the family of algorithms used: since the system leverages linguistic signals from text data, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is definitely a category here. Additionally, personality traits are a form of user profiling, so User Profiling should be included.

The domain of the problem seems to be social media because that&#39;s where the data is being extracted from. So Social Media makes sense as another category. The application involves recommendations, specifically people recommendation, which points towards People Recommendation and Collaborative Filtering since it&#39;s about matching individuals based on their profiles.

Looking at evaluation aspects, the paper likely discusses how accurate these personality traits are derived and how effective the recommendations are. Hence, Evaluation Metrics would be a relevant category here. User-Centered Design is also important because the system aims to personalize applications for better user experiences.

The fact that it&#39;s used in real-world applications like recommending people for tasks indicates Real-World Applications. Moreover, since it deals with understanding and predicting human behavior based on social media data, Human Behavior Analysis would be a fitting category. Lastly, since the system is scalable across various personalized uses, Scalability should also be considered.

I should make sure each article is placed in at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability without overcrowding any single category. The categories I&#39;ve identified seem specific and cover both the technical aspects (NLP, User Profiling) and application domains (Social Media, People Recommendation). They also touch on evaluation and real-world usage, which aligns with user-centric design principles.

I think these categories accurately reflect the content of the article and should help users navigate and discover related research effectively.
&lt;/think&gt;
