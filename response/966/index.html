        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Turning Dross Into Gold Loss: is BERT4Rec really better than SASRec?
Abstract:
Recently sequential recommendations and next-item prediction task has become increasingly popular in the field of recommender systems. Currently, two state-of-the-art baselines are Transformer-based models SASRec and BERT4Rec. Over the past few years, there have been quite a few publications comparing these two algorithms and proposing new state-of-the-art models. In most of the publications, BERT4Rec achieves better performance than SASRec. But BERT4Rec uses cross-entropy over softmax for all items, while SASRec uses negative sampling and calculates binary cross-entropy loss for one positive and one negative item. In our work, we show that if both models are trained with the same loss, which is used by BERT4Rec, then SASRec will significantly outperform BERT4Rec both in terms of quality and training speed. In addition, we show that SASRec could be effectively trained with negative sampling and still outperform BERT4Rec, but the number of negative examples should be much larger than one.

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task step by step. The article is titled &#34;Turning Dross Into Gold Loss: is BERT4Rec really better than SASRec?&#34; and the abstract discusses a comparison between these two recommendation models, focusing on their loss functions.

First, I need to identify the core themes. The main focus is on comparing BERT4Rec and SASRec, which are both Transformer-based models used in sequential recommendations. So, categories like &#34;Sequential Recommendations&#34; and &#34;Transformer-Based Models&#34; make sense here.

The article delves into the technical aspects of their performance, specifically looking at loss functionsâ€”cross-entropy versus negative sampling. This points to categories related to evaluation metrics such as &#34;Evaluation Metrics&#34; and &#34;Loss Functions.&#34;

Since both models are state-of-the-art, including a category like &#34;State-of-the-Art Models&#34; is appropriate. The comparison aspect suggests adding &#34;Algorithm Comparison.&#34; 

The study also touches on training efficiency and model performance, so categories like &#34;Training Efficiency&#34; and &#34;Model Performance&#34; fit well.

Looking at the broader domain, this falls under &#34;Recommender Systems.&#34; Additionally, since the article discusses specific aspects of how models are trained and evaluated, categories such as &#34;Negative Sampling&#34; and &#34;Binary Cross-Entropy Loss&#34; should be included to capture those details accurately.

I need to ensure each category is both broad enough for discoverability and specific enough to provide useful information. Assigning around 10 categories seems appropriate here without overcrowding any single category.
&lt;/think&gt;
