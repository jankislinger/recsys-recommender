Title: Touch the Core: Exploring Task Dependence Among Hybrid Targets for Recommendation
Abstract:
As user behaviors become complicated on business platforms, online recommendations focus more on how to touch the core conversions, which are highly related to the interests of platforms. These core conversions are usually continuous targets, such as watch time, revenue, and so on, whose predictions can be enhanced by previous discrete conversion actions. Therefore, multi-task learning (MTL) can be adopted as the paradigm to learn these hybrid targets. However, existing works mainly emphasize investigating the sequential dependence among discrete conversion actions, which neglects the complexity of dependence between discrete conversions and the final continuous conversion. Moreover, simultaneously optimizing hybrid tasks with stronger task dependence will suffer from volatile issues where the core regression task might have a larger influence on other tasks. In this paper, we study the MTL problem with hybrid targets for the first time and propose the model named Hybrid Targets Learning Network (HTLNet) to explore task dependence and enhance optimization. Specifically, we introduce label embedding for each task to explicitly transfer the label information among these tasks, which can effectively explore logical task dependence. We also further design the gradient adjustment regime between the final regression task and other classification tasks to enhance the optimization. Extensive experiments on two offline public datasets and one real-world industrial dataset are conducted to validate the effectiveness of HTLNet. Moreover, online A/B tests on the financial recommender system also show our model has superior improvement.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. The user wants at least 8-12 categories that accurately reflect the content for a user-friendly interface.

First, looking at the title: &#34;Touch the Core: Exploring Task Dependence Among Hybrid Targets for Recommendation.&#34; This suggests it&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically dealing with hybrid targets or multiple tasks in recommendations.

The abstract mentions multi-task learning (MTL) being used as a paradigm to handle these hybrid targets. So that&#39;s another key pointâ€”multi-task learning is central here.

It talks about core conversions like watch time and revenue, which are continuous targets. These relate to user behavior and engagement metrics, so categories related to user behavior or engagement might be relevant.

The paper also addresses the dependence between discrete and continuous conversions. Discrete actions could include clicks or purchases (binary outcomes), while continuous could be watch time or revenue amounts. So perhaps a category about task dependence would fit here.

They mention improving predictions using MTL by considering these dependencies, which ties into recommendation techniques. The model they propose is HTLNet, so that&#39;s specific to their approach but might not need its own category unless it&#39;s well-known, which I don&#39;t think it is yet.

The experiments are done on both public datasets and real-world industrial data, including A/B tests on a financial recommender system. This indicates practical applications in industry settings, so categories like real-world applications or A/B testing would be appropriate.

Looking at the evaluation aspects, they focus on enhancing the effectiveness of their model through gradient adjustments and label embeddings, which might fall under optimization techniques within recommendation systems.

Also, considering the domain aspect, since it&#39;s about a financial recommender system, finance is a specific domain category. But if the article isn&#39;t solely focused on finance but rather uses it as an example, maybe a more general business applications category would be better.

Now, compiling these thoughts into categories: 

1. Multi-task Learning (MTL) - central to the approach.
2. Recommendation Systems - main focus area.
3. Task Dependence - key concept explored.
4. Hybrid Targets - dealing with multiple types of targets.
5. User Behavior - related to core conversions and engagement metrics.
6. Real-World Applications - as they tested in an industrial setting.
7. A/B Testing - part of their evaluation.
8. Financial Recommender Systems - specific application domain.
9. Optimization Techniques - methods used to enhance the model.
10. Online Recommendations - since it&#39;s about online platforms.
11. Gradient Adjustment - a specific technique they mention.
12. Label Embedding - another method they introduce.

I think these cover the main aspects from the abstract without overlapping too much and provide enough categories for discoverability. I should ensure each category is clear and user-friendly, avoiding overly technical jargon where possible but still accurate.

Wait, maybe &#34;Hybrid Targets&#34; could be a bit unclear without context. Perhaps rephrase it to something like &#34;Hybrid Conversion Models&#34;? Or keep it as is if the term is understood in the field. Alternatively, stick with &#34;Hybrid Targets&#34; since that&#39;s how they refer to it in the title and abstract.

Also, considering whether any of these categories are too specific or might be better grouped under broader terms. For example, &#34;Financial Recommender Systems&#34; is quite narrow; maybe include a more general category like &#34;Business Applications&#34; as well. But I think including both could provide better coverage for users interested in finance specifically and those looking for business applications generally.

I should also check if all these categories are distinct enough or if some can be merged without losing clarity. For example, &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; and &#34;A/B Testing&#34; are related but different enough to warrant separate categories.

Finally, ensuring that each category is something a user might search for when exploring research articles. Terms like &#34;Recommendation Systems,&#34; &#34;Multi-task Learning,&#34; &#34;Task Dependence,&#34; and &#34;User Behavior&#34; seem likely candidates.

Alright, I&#39;m looking at this article about recommendation systems using multi-task learning for hybrid targets. The title mentions &#34;Task Dependence Among Hybrid Targets,&#34; so that&#39;s a key point. 

The abstract talks about predicting continuous targets like watch time and revenue, which are influenced by discrete actions. So, the domain here is clearly recommendations in business platforms.

They mention using MTL (Multi-Task Learning) to handle both discrete and continuous tasks, which fits under algorithms related to multi-task learning. The model they propose is HTLNet, so that&#39;s a specific algorithm category.

The problem they address involves cold start or new users because it&#39;s about improving recommendations through better task optimization, which makes &#34;Cold Start&#34; applicable.

They evaluate using metrics like RMSE and AUC, which falls under evaluation methods. They also use real-world applications with A/B testing in a financial setting, so that&#39;s another category.

The aspects discussed include task dependence, label embedding, gradient adjustment, and optimization techniques, all part of recommendation system specifics. 

Putting it together, the categories should cover the algorithm, application areas, evaluation metrics, real-world deployment, specific problem areas like cold start, and more detailed aspects like embeddings and gradients.
&lt;/think&gt;
