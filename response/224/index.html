        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: The Contextual Turn: from Context-Aware to Context-Driven Recommender Systems
Abstract:
A critical change has occurred in the status of context in recommender systems. In the past, context has been considered `additional evidence’. This past picture is at odds with many present application domains, where user and item information is scarce. Such domains face continuous cold start conditions and must exploit session rather than user information. In this paper, we describe the `Contextual Turn’: the move towards context-driven recommendation algorithms for which context is critical, rather than additional. We cover application domains, algorithms that promise to address the challenges of context-driven recommendation, and the steps that the community has taken to tackle context-driven problems. Our goal is to point out the commonalities of context-driven problems, and urge the community to address the overarching challenges that context-driven recommendation poses.

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task step by step. The article title mentions &#34;Contextual Turn&#34; and talks about moving from context-aware to context-driven recommender systems. So, my first thought is that this falls under Context-Aware Recommenders or something similar.

The abstract says context has changed from being additional evidence to being critical. That makes me think about how the role of context in recommendation systems has evolved, so maybe a category like &#34;Evolution of Recommendation&#34; would fit here.

It mentions application domains and algorithms addressing context-driven challenges. So, I should include categories for both the domain aspect and the algorithm aspect. Looking at examples, something like &#34;Context-Driven Algorithms&#34; makes sense.

The article also talks about cold start conditions where user and item information is scarce. That&#39;s a key issue in recommendation systems, so &#34;Cold Start&#34; is definitely relevant.

They discuss the move from context-aware to context-driven approaches, which indicates a shift or change in methodology. So, categories like &#34;Methodology Shifts&#34; would capture that evolution.

The paper covers steps the community has taken and urges them to address challenges. This sounds like it&#39;s about the current state of research and future directions, so &#34;Research Directions&#34; seems appropriate.

Considering the focus on how context is now central rather than additional, a category like &#34;Central Context in Recommendations&#34; could highlight that importance.

The abstract also talks about exploiting session information instead of user data due to scarce info. So, categories such as &#34;Session-Based Recommendations&#34; and &#34;Data-Scarce Domains&#34; are relevant here.

Lastly, the paper points out commonalities and challenges, which suggests it&#39;s a survey or overview of existing work. Therefore, including &#34;Survey/Overview&#34; would be fitting.
&lt;/think&gt;
