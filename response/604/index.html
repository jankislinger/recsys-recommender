        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Investigating Listeners’ Responses to Divergent Recommendations
Abstract:
Recommender systems offer great opportunity not only for users to discover new content, but also for the providers of that content to find new audience, followers, and fans. Users often come to a recommender system with certain expectations about what it will recommend to them, and a recommender system that is optimized for creating opportunities for content creators may provide recommendations that are very different from what a user is expecting. We hypothesize that some users’ expectations have a much wider range of acceptability than others, and users with more ”receptivity” to subversion of their expectations are likely to accept such divergence in the recommended content. Understanding users’ responses to such recommendations is vital to platforms that need to serve multiple stakeholders. In this work we investigate logged behavioral responses of users of an audio streaming platform to recommendations that deviate from their expectation, or “divergent” recommendations. We present three classes of listener response to divergent recommendations that can be identified in interaction logs with the aim of predicting which users can be targeted for future divergent recommendations. We derive a number of user characteristics based on user’s music consumption which we think are predictive of user’s receptivity, train models to predict receptivity of these users, and run a live A/B test to validate our approach by correlating with engagement.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories as per the guidelines provided. Let me start by understanding the article&#39;s content.

The title is &#34;Investigating Listeners’ Responses to Divergent Recommendations.&#34; The abstract discusses how recommender systems can help users discover new content and help providers reach new audiences. It talks about user expectations versus recommendations that might be unexpected, especially for platforms serving multiple stakeholders like audio streaming services. They&#39;ve identified three classes of listener responses to these divergent recommendations and used user characteristics based on music consumption to predict receptivity. They also ran an A/B test to validate their approach.

Now, I&#39;ll break down the key elements:

1. **Recommender Systems**: The article is about how recommendation systems work, especially regarding unexpected content.
2. **User Behavior**: It focuses on how users respond when recommendations don&#39;t meet their expectations.
3. **Divergent Recommendations**: This seems specific to the type of recommendations that go against user expectations.
4. **Expectation Subversion**: Users&#39; reactions when recommendations deviate from what they expect.
5. **Receptivity Prediction**: Using models to predict how open users are to unexpected content.
6. **A/B Testing**: They validated their approach with a live test, which is a real-world application.
7. **Music Consumption**: The user characteristics are based on their music habits.
8. **Multi-Stakeholder Platforms**: The system serves both users and content providers.

Considering these points, I should map them to the categories provided as examples:

- **Algorithm Family**: Not directly mentioned, but they used models for prediction, so maybe something like &#34;Predictive Models.&#34;
- **Domain of Problem**: It&#39;s about an audio streaming platform, so &#34;Music&#34; or &#34;Audio Streaming.&#34;
- **Specific Recommendation Aspect**: They&#39;re looking at divergent recommendations, so &#34;Divergent Recommendations,&#34; &#34;Expectation Subversion,&#34; and &#34;Receptivity Prediction.&#34;
- **Evaluation Aspects**: They looked into user behavior and engagement metrics.
- **Real-World Applications**: They ran A/B tests, which is a real-world application.

I should also consider broader categories that might include these aspects. For instance, &#34;User Behavior&#34; captures the response side, while &#34;Recommender Systems&#34; is a broad category encompassing the whole topic.

So, compiling all this into relevant categories:

- **Divergent Recommendations**: Directly addresses the type of recommendations studied.
- **Expectation Subversion**: Specific to how recommendations deviate from user expectations.
- **User Behavior**: Focuses on how users react.
- **Receptivity Prediction**: The prediction models they developed.
- **A/B Testing**: Real-world application method used.
- **Music Consumption**: Based on the user characteristics analyzed.
- **Multi-Stakeholder Platforms**: Reflects the platform serving multiple interests.
- **Predictive Models**: The algorithms used for predictions.
- **Recommender Systems**: Broad category covering recommendation technology.

I think these categories cover both specific aspects and broader themes, ensuring discoverability and alignment with user needs. I should ensure that each category is clear and descriptive to help users navigate effectively.
&lt;/think&gt;
