        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Matching Theory-based Recommendation in Online Dating
Abstract:
Online dating platforms provide people with the opportunity to find a partner. Recommender systems in online dating platforms suggest one side of users to the other side of users. This reciprocal recommendation problem arises in online dating [26 , 31 ], job recommendation [2] and peer learning process [27]. Reciprocal recommender systems (RRSs) must take into account two aspects which do not arise in standard recommender systems. One aspect is the mutual interests of users. Even if one user has a strong interest in a particular user, she/he may have no interest in him/her at all. Thus, RRSs should be based on the interests of both sides of users. The other important aspect is capacities of the users; it is impossible for a user to keep up with all the candidates. Popular users are often recommended very frequently. As a result, a few super stars receive a large proportion of likes, overwhelming the time that they can spend for screening. RRSs should be designed to alleviate such problems to increase user satisfaction. The two-sided matching problem is to “match” one side of people and the other side in a situation where each person has a different preference and a matching capacity. This field is called matching theory, and various algorithms have been developed since [ 11 , 29 ]. Matching theory is applied in the analyses of marriage markets [4, 8], school choice [1] and job matching for physicians [28]. In this talk, we discuss the potential interactions between RRSs and matching theory. We also present our ongoing project to deploy a matching theory-based recommender system (MTRS) in a real-world online dating platform. This talk covers other important directions regarding RRSs, including scalability, algorithmic fairness, bandit algorithm, and online experimentation.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about Matching Theory-based Recommendation in Online Dating. Let me read through the title and abstract again to understand what it&#39;s about.

The title mentions &#34;Matching Theory&#34; and its application in recommendation systems for online dating. From the abstract, it seems that the focus is on reciprocal recommendation systems (RRSs) which are different from standard recommender systems because they need to consider mutual interests and user capacities. The article also talks about deploying a matching theory-based system (MTRS) in a real-world platform and touches on scalability, fairness, bandit algorithms, and online experiments.

So, I should start by identifying the main themes here. First, it&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically reciprocal ones used in dating platforms. That makes me think categories like &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; and &#34;Online Dating&#34; are relevant. The abstract also mentions matching theory, so that&#39;s another category. It discusses the mutual interests aspect, which is a specific challenge in RRSs, so maybe &#34;Mutual Interests&#34; or something similar.

The problem of user capacity, where popular users get overwhelmed with recommendations, points towards &#34;User Capacity Management.&#34; Also, it&#39;s clear this is an application in a real-world setting, so categories like &#34;Real-World Applications,&#34; &#34;A/B Testing,&#34; and &#34;User Survey&#34; might fit since they mention online experimentation.

Looking at the broader areas, the article connects recommendation systems with matching theory, which is used in other domains like job matching or school choice. So &#34;Matching Theory&#34; should definitely be a category. The challenges discussed include scalability and fairness, so those are important aspects to categorize under.

Additionally, since it&#39;s about two-sided markets (like users on both sides of the dating platform), that&#39;s another key point. The mention of bandit algorithms ties into multi-armed bandits, which is a specific algorithm family. Lastly, deployment in a real-world setting and the implications for user satisfaction suggest categories like &#34;Deployment&#34; and &#34;User Satisfaction.&#34;

Putting it all together, I&#39;ll list out these categories ensuring they cover both specific aspects (like reciprocal recommendations) and broader themes (such as matching theory and recommendation systems). Each category should help users find related articles easily without being too niche or too broad.
&lt;/think&gt;
