        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Dynamics of Human Trust in Recommender Systems
Abstract:
The trust that humans place on recommendations is key to the success of recommender systems. The formation and decay of trust in recommendations is a dynamic process influenced by context, human preferences, accuracy of recommendations, and the interactions of these factors. This paper describes two psychological experiments (N=400) that evaluate the evolution of trust in recommendations over time, under personalized and non-personalized recommendations by matching or not matching a participantâ€™s profile. Main findings include: Humans trust inaccurate recommendations more than they should; when recommendations are personalized, they lose trust in inaccurate recommendations faster than when recommendations are not personalized; and participants learn to select the options that provide best outcomes increasingly over time when they use personalized recommendations, while they are unable to learn if the recommendations are not personalized. We make connections to the possible implications that these psychological findings to the design of recommender systems.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article about human trust in recommender systems. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Dynamics of Human Trust in Recommender Systems.&#34; The abstract mentions experiments with 400 participants looking at how trust evolves over time, especially regarding personalized vs non-personalized recommendations. Key findings include issues with inaccurate recommendations, faster loss of trust when personalized, and learning outcomes based on recommendation type.

So, I should identify the main themes here: trust dynamics, user behavior, psychological factors, recommendation accuracy, personalization effects, and implications for system design.

Looking at possible categories:

- **Trust Dynamics**: Directly related to how users&#39; trust changes.
- **User Behavior**: Since it&#39;s about participants reacting to recommendations.
- **Psychology of Recommendations**: Because the study involves psychological experiments.
- **Recommendation Accuracy**: As accuracy affects trust levels.
- **Personalization in Recommendations**: Personalized vs non-personalized is a key variable.
- **Human Factors**: Involves human decision-making and learning.
- **Recommender Systems Design**: The paper discusses implications for system design.
- **User Trust**: Another way to look at the core theme of trust.
- **Learning from Recommendations**: Participants learned outcomes over time.
- **Evaluation Methods**: They conducted experiments, so this fits.
- **Psychological Experiments**: Specific type of evaluation method used.

I think these categories cover both specific aspects and broader themes. I should make sure each is relevant without being too narrow or too broad. Maybe &#34;Recommendation Accuracy&#34; is a bit broad but necessary here. Also, including terms like &#34;Personalization in Recommendations&#34; and &#34;Psychology of Recommendations&#34; ensures specificity. 

I don&#39;t think any categories are redundant here, and they all seem to align with the article&#39;s focus on trust dynamics influenced by personalization and accuracy, affecting user behavior and system design.
&lt;/think&gt;
