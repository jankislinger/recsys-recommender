        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: You Do Not Need a Bigger Boat: Recommendations at Reasonable Scale in a (Mostly) Serverless and Open Stack.
Abstract:
We argue that immature data pipelines are preventing a large portion of industry practitioners from leveraging the latest research on recommender systems. We propose our template data stack for machine learning at “reasonable scale”, and show how many challenges are solved by embracing a serverless paradigm. Leveraging our experience, we detail how modern open source tools can provide a pipeline processing terabytes of data with minimal infrastructure work.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. The goal is to help users easily find the content they&#39;re interested in. Let me start by reading through the provided information.

The title is &#34;You Do Not Need a Bigger Boat: Recommendations at Reasonable Scale in a (Mostly) Serverless and Open Stack.&#34; That gives me some initial clues about serverless architecture, recommendation systems, and using open-source tools.

Looking at the abstract, it talks about how immature data pipelines prevent industry practitioners from leveraging the latest recommender system research. The authors propose a template data stack for machine learning at &#34;reasonable scale&#34; and discuss challenges solved by a serverless paradigm. They also mention modern open-source tools processing terabytes of data with minimal infrastructure work.

Now, I need to map this information into relevant categories. Let&#39;s break it down step by step.

First, the article is about recommendation systems, so that&#39;s a primary category. It discusses machine learning, which is another broad area. The serverless paradigm is a key point, so &#34;Serverless&#34; should be included.

The title mentions an open stack and the abstract talks about modern open-source tools, so &#34;Open Source Tools&#34; fits here. They also mention data pipelines and processing terabytes of data, pointing towards &#34;Data Pipelines&#34; and &#34;Big Data.&#34;

Infrastructure is discussed in terms of minimal work, so &#34;Infrastructure&#34; makes sense. The term &#34;Reasonable Scale&#34; from the title suggests that scalability is a focus, hence &#34;Scalability.&#34; 

The problem addressed relates to industry practitioners leveraging research, which implies practical application rather than theoretical, so maybe &#34;Practical Applications&#34; or something similar.

They propose a template data stack, indicating a method or framework approach, so perhaps &#34;Data Stack Frameworks.&#34;

Also, the article discusses challenges in data pipelines and serverless solutions, so another category could be &#34;Data Engineering.&#34;

Wait, but looking back at the examples provided, categories are more specific. Let me check the examples: Family of algorithm (like Matrix Factorization), Domain (Books, Movies, etc.), specific recommendation aspects like Cold Start, evaluation aspects like Diversity, real-world applications like A/B Testing.

In this case, since it&#39;s about infrastructure and tools rather than algorithms or domains, I need to align with provided examples but also consider new relevant categories. The user included &#34;Serverless,&#34; which is a type of infrastructure.

So perhaps categories like &#34;Recommender Systems,&#34; &#34;Machine Learning Infrastructure,&#34; &#34;Data Pipelines,&#34; &#34;Serverless Architecture,&#34; &#34;Open Source Tools,&#34; &#34;Scalability,&#34; and maybe &#34;Big Data Processing.&#34;

Wait, the example output in the problem statement uses categories like &#34;Cold Start&#34; or &#34;Diversity of Recommendations.&#34; Since this article is more about infrastructure and tools, perhaps I need to focus on those areas.

Another point: the abstract mentions processing terabytes with minimal infrastructure, so &#34;Infrastructure as Code&#34; could be a category, but that might not fit exactly. Alternatively, &#34;Cloud Infrastructure.&#34;

Wait, no, in the example categories provided by the user, they include things like &#34;Family of algorithm,&#34; domain specifics, recommendation aspects, evaluation aspects, real-world applications.

Since this article is about infrastructure and tools for recommendations, perhaps I should categorize it under &#34;Infrastructure,&#34; &#34;Serverless,&#34; &#34;Data Pipelines,&#34; &#34;Open Source Tools,&#34; etc. But I need to make sure the categories are as per the user&#39;s guidelines, which include things like family of algorithms, domain, recommendation aspects, evaluation, real-world applications.

But in this case, the article is more about the infrastructure and tools used for recommendation systems rather than the algorithm itself or the domain it&#39;s applied to. So perhaps I need to create categories that reflect the technical aspects discussed.

So, let me list out possible categories:

1. Recommender Systems - since it&#39;s about recommendations.
2. Machine Learning Infrastructure - because it&#39;s about setting up infrastructure for ML at scale.
3. Serverless Architecture - as the article focuses on serverless solutions.
4. Data Pipelines - discusses building efficient data pipelines.
5. Open Source Tools - mentions leveraging open-source tools.
6. Scalability - processing terabytes indicates scalability is a focus.
7. Practical Applications - since it&#39;s about industry practitioners applying research.
8. Big Data Processing - handling large datasets.

Wait, the user example in the problem statement used categories like &#34;Cold Start,&#34; which is a specific recommendation aspect, but this article doesn&#39;t mention that. Instead, it&#39;s more about infrastructure and tools for recommendations.

Looking back at the examples provided by the user, they also had categories like &#34;Family of algorithm,&#34; &#34;Domain,&#34; &#34;Specific recommendation aspects,&#34; evaluation aspects, real-world applications, etc. Since this isn&#39;t an algorithm or a domain-specific article, I might need to focus on other categories that fit better.

Additionally, the article talks about challenges in data pipelines and using open-source tools to solve them, which could fall under &#34;Data Engineering&#34; as well.

So, compiling all these thoughts, here&#39;s how I can categorize:

- Recommender Systems (core topic)
- Machine Learning Infrastructure
- Serverless Architecture
- Data Pipelines
- Open Source Tools
- Scalability
- Big Data Processing

I think that covers the main points. Each category is relevant and should help users find this article when they&#39;re looking into these areas.

Another thought: since it&#39;s about a template data stack, maybe &#34;Data Stack Frameworks&#34; could be another category, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s too specific or if it&#39;s covered under other categories like Machine Learning Infrastructure or Data Pipelines.

I&#39;ll stick with the initial list and ensure each is distinct and relevant.
&lt;/think&gt;
