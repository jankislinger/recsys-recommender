Title: Scaling Law of Large Sequential Recommendation Models
Abstract:
Scaling of neural networks has recently shown great potential to improve the model capacity in various fields. Specifically, model performance has a power-law relationship with model size or data size, which provides important guidance for the development of large-scale models. However, there is still limited understanding on the scaling effect of user behavior models in recommender systems, where the unique data characteristics (e.g., data scarcity and sparsity) pose new challenges in recommendation tasks. In this work, we focus on investigating the scaling laws in large sequential recommendation models. Specifically, we consider a pure ID-based task formulation, where the interaction history of a user is formatted as a chronological sequence of item IDs. We don’t incorporate any side information (e.g., item text), to delve into the scaling law’s applicability from the perspective of user behavior. We successfully scale up the model size to 0.8B parameters, making it feasible to explore the scaling effect in a diverse range of model sizes. As the major findings, we empirically show that the scaling law still holds for these trained models, even in data-constrained scenarios. We then fit the curve for scaling law, and successfully predict the test loss of the two largest tested model scales. Furthermore, we examine the performance advantage of scaling effect on five challenging recommendation tasks, considering the unique issues (e.g., cold start, robustness, long-term preference) in recommender systems. We find that scaling up the model size can greatly boost the performance on these challenging tasks, which again verifies the benefits of large recommendation models.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its content and themes. The goal is to help users easily navigate and discover articles through a user-friendly interface.

First, looking at the title: &#34;Scaling Law of Large Sequential Recommendation Models.&#34; This immediately tells me it&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically focusing on scaling laws in large models that handle sequential data.

The abstract starts by talking about how neural networks&#39; scaling has improved model capacity across various fields. It mentions a power-law relationship between model size or data size and performance. So, this is related to model scalability and the effectiveness of larger models.

The article then addresses recommender systems and their unique challenges like data scarcity and sparsity. This indicates it&#39;s dealing with recommendation tasks and the specific issues faced there. They mention sequential recommendations, which points towards handling user behavior over time.

They used a pure ID-based approach without side information, focusing on item IDs in a chronological sequence. That means they&#39;re looking at how models process sequences of interactions without additional data like text or images. This could be important for understanding the core dynamics of recommendation systems.

The model size was scaled up to 0.8B parameters, which is quite large, allowing them to explore scaling effects across different sizes. The findings show that scaling laws still apply even with limited data, and they can predict test loss based on these models. This ties into evaluation metrics like prediction accuracy and how model size affects performance.

They also tested the performance on five challenging tasks in recommendation systems: cold start, robustness, long-term preference, etc. Each of these is a specific issue within recommendations that scaling might help address. So, this points to categories related to those challenges as well as aspects of evaluation beyond just accuracy.

Considering the guidelines, I need to assign 8-12 categories. Let me list possible ones:

1. Recommendation Systems: The main area of focus.
2. Scaling Laws: Discusses how model performance scales with size.
3. Sequential Recommendations: Deals with user behavior sequences.
4. Model Scalability: How models handle increased size or data.
5. Large Language Models (maybe? Or is it specific to recommendation models?) They scaled a recommendation model, so maybe not LLMs specifically but large models in general.
6. User Behavior Modeling: Focuses on how users interact over time.
7. Cold Start Problem: One of the challenges they addressed.
8. Evaluation Metrics: They looked at test loss and other performance aspects.
9. Data Sparsity: A challenge in recommendation systems.
10. Model Capacity: Related to model size and its impact.

I should ensure these categories are clear and user-friendly. Maybe also include &#34;Challenging Tasks&#34; but that&#39;s too vague. Instead, specific issues like cold start, robustness might be better as separate categories if they each get enough articles, but perhaps combining under a broader category is safer.

Wait, the example given included categories like &#34;Cold Start,&#34; which seems applicable here. So, I can include that. Also, aspects of evaluation beyond accuracy would fit since they looked at various recommendation tasks&#39; performance.

Putting it all together, I think these categories cover the main points: Recommendation Systems, Scaling Laws, Sequential Recommendations, Model Scalability, Large Models (maybe &#34;Large-Scale Models&#34;), User Behavior Modeling, Cold Start Problem, Evaluation Metrics, Data Sparsity, Model Capacity. Maybe also &#34;Challenging Tasks&#34; but perhaps that&#39;s too broad.

I should aim for around 10 categories without being redundant. Let me pick the most relevant ones.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, so I&#39;m looking at this research article titled &#34;Scaling Law of Large Sequential Recommendation Models.&#34; The abstract talks about how scaling neural networks affects model capacity and specifically looks into user behavior models in recommender systems. They mention challenges like data scarcity and sparsity and focus on a pure ID-based task without side information.

First, the main theme here is scalability in recommendation models. That&#39;s a key point, so &#34;Scalability&#34; should definitely be one of the categories.

Next, they&#39;re dealing with sequential recommendation, which is about user interaction over time. So that points to &#34;Sequential Recommendation.&#34;

The study looks at model scaling laws, which refers to how performance changes with size. Therefore, &#34;Model Scaling Laws&#34; makes sense as another category.

They use an ID-based approach without item text, so it&#39;s focused on IDs and sequences, hence &#34;ID-Based Models.&#34;

Recommendation systems is the overarching area here, so that&#39;s a broad category: &#34;Recommendation Systems.&#34;

The abstract also mentions real-world applications like handling cold start and robustness issues. So including &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; would capture that aspect.

They discuss performance in data-constrained scenarios, which ties into &#34;Data Scarcity,&#34; a specific challenge they address.

Additionally, the study looks at various recommendation tasks, so &#34;Recommendation Tasks&#34; should be included to cover that ground.

Finally, considering aspects like cold start and long-term preference falls under &#34;Cold Start Problem,&#34; making it another relevant category.

Putting it all together, I&#39;ve identified these categories by focusing on the article&#39;s core themes, ensuring they&#39;re both specific and broad enough for user navigation.
&lt;/think&gt;

Scalability, Sequential Recommendation, Model Scaling Laws, ID-Based Models, Recommendation Systems, Real-World Applications, Data Scarcity, Recommendation Tasks, Cold Start Problem</code></pre>
