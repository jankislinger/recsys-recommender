        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Adaptation and Evaluation of Recommendations for Short-term Shopping Goals
Abstract:
An essential characteristic in many of e-commerce settings is that website visitors can have very specific short-term shopping goals when they browse the site. Relying solely on long-term user models that are pre-trained on historical data can therefore be insufficient for recommendation. Simple “real-time” recommendation approaches based, e.g., on unpersonalized co-occurrence patterns, on the other hand do not fully exploit the available information about the user’s long-term preference profile. In this work, we aim to explore and quantify the effectiveness of using and combining long-term models and short-term adaptation strategies. We conducted an empirical evaluation based on a novel evaluation design and two real-world datasets. The results indicate that maintaining short-term and profiles of the visitors can lead to significant accuracy increases. At the same time, the experiments show that the choice of the algorithm for learning the long term preferences is particularly important at the beginning of new shopping sessions.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through both carefully.

The title is &#34;Adaptation and Evaluation of Recommendations for Short-term Shopping Goals.&#34; Hmm, that immediately tells me it&#39;s about recommendation systems in e-commerce, specifically focusing on short-term goals. 

Looking at the abstract, it talks about how website visitors have specific short-term shopping goals when browsing. It mentions that relying solely on long-term user models isn&#39;t enough because they&#39;re pre-trained on historical data and might not capture current intent. So the article is addressing a gap where recommendation systems need to adapt quickly based on immediate user behavior.

The abstract goes on to discuss combining long-term models with short-term adaptation strategies. They conducted an empirical evaluation using two real-world datasets, which suggests that the research isn&#39;t just theoretical but has practical applications. The results show significant accuracy improvements when maintaining both short-term and long-term profiles. Also, they found that the choice of algorithm for learning long-term preferences is crucial at the start of new shopping sessions.

Now, thinking about how to categorize this. Let me go through the guidelines again:

1. **Categorization Accuracy**: The categories should reflect the content accurately.
2. **Category Utility**: They need enough articles in each category without overcrowding others.
3. **User-Centric Design**: Categories that users would likely search for.
4. **Consistency**: Apply the same logic across all categorizations.

The article is about recommendation systems, so one obvious category is &#34;Recommendation Systems.&#34; It&#39;s specifically about e-commerce, so &#34;E-Commerce&#34; fits here too. The focus on adapting recommendations to short-term goals suggests &#34;Short-Term Adaptation,&#34; and since it combines long-term models, &#34;Long-Term Models&#34; should be included.

The empirical evaluation with real-world datasets points towards &#34;Empirical Evaluation.&#34; They also mention using two datasets, which relates to &#34;Data Analysis.&#34; The results show accuracy improvements, so &#34;Accuracy Improvement&#34; is relevant. 

They discuss combining different approaches, so &#34;Hybrid Approaches&#34; makes sense. Since the study is about user behavior in shopping sessions, &#34;User Behavior&#34; is a good fit. It&#39;s also an applied study with real-world applications, hence &#34;Applied Research.&#34; They used algorithms for learning preferences, which falls under &#34;Algorithm Selection.&#34;

Putting it all together, I think these categories cover the key aspects of the article without overlapping too much or being too vague. Each category should help users find this article if they&#39;re interested in any of those areas.
&lt;/think&gt;
