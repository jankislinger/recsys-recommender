Title: Context-aware Graph Embedding for Session-based News Recommendation
Abstract:
Online news recommender systems aim to make personalized recommendations according to user preferences, which require modeling usersâ€™ short-term reading interest. However, due to the limited logged user interactions in practice, news recommendation at session-level becomes very challenging. Existing methods on session-based news recommendation mainly focus on extracting features from news articles and sequential user-item interactions, but they usually ignore the semantic-level structural information among news articles and do not explore external knowledge sources. In this paper, we propose a novel Context-Aware Graph Embedding (CAGE) framework for session-based news recommendation, which builds an auxiliary knowledge graph to enrich the semantic meaning of entities involved in articles, and further refines the article embeddings by graph convolutional networks. Experimental results on a real-world news dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods on session-based news recommendation.

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task for the research article titled &#34;Context-aware Graph Embedding for Session-based News Recommendation.&#34; The goal is to assign multiple relevant categories to ensure users can easily explore and discover the content.

First, I&#39;ll start by analyzing the title and abstract provided. The title mentions &#34;Context-aware Graph Embedding&#34; and its application in &#34;Session-based News Recommendation.&#34; From this, I can infer that the article is about recommendation systems, specifically within the news domain.

Looking at the abstract, it discusses the challenges of modeling users&#39; short-term reading interests due to limited interactions, which points towards session-based recommendations. The paper introduces a framework called CAGE, which uses graph embedding techniques and an auxiliary knowledge graph. This indicates that the article is leveraging knowledge graphs and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for enhancing recommendation accuracy.

Now, considering the categories from the examples provided:

1. **Family of Algorithm**: Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.
   - The paper uses Context- Aware Graph Embedding (CAGE), which is a type of graph-based method. So &#34;Graph Embedding&#34; and &#34;Knowledge Graphs&#34; fit here.

2. **Domain of the Problem**: Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.
   - Since it&#39;s about news recommendations, &#34;News Recommendation&#34; is the domain category.

3. **Specific in Recommendation Space**: Cold Start, Session-based Recommendations, etc.
   - The article focuses on session-based recommendations, so that&#39;s a relevant category.

4. **Aspects of Evaluation**: Diversity, Beyond Accuracy.
   - While not explicitly mentioned, since it&#39;s about improving recommendation quality, &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; might be a stretch but could be considered if the evaluation includes other metrics besides accuracy.

5. **Real-world Applications**: A/B Test, User Survey.
   - The paper mentions experimental results on a real-world dataset, so that touches on real-world applications, though more specific categories like &#34;A/B Testing&#34; aren&#39;t directly applicable here.

Additionally, looking at the content:

- It builds an auxiliary knowledge graph to enhance semantic meaning, which ties into &#34;Knowledge Graphs.&#34;
- Uses graph convolutional networks, so &#34;Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)&#34; is appropriate.
- The context-aware aspect suggests it considers user context, so &#34;Context Awareness&#34; fits.

Considering the guidelines, each article should be assigned 8-12 categories. I need to ensure that these categories are both specific and broad enough for discoverability without overcrowding any category.

Potential categories include:

- News Recommendation
- Session-based Recommendations
- Graph Embedding
- Knowledge Graphs
- Context Awareness
- Personalized Recommendations
- User Interest Modeling
- Recommender Systems
- Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)
- Real-world Applications

I should avoid overly broad categories unless necessary. For instance, &#34;Recommender Systems&#34; is a broader category that encapsulates the specific application here.

Double-checking to ensure each category aligns with the content:

- **News Recommendation**: Directly from the title and abstract.
- **Session-based Recommendations**: The article focuses on session-level recommendations.
- **Graph Embedding**: Central to their proposed method.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Built an auxiliary knowledge graph as part of CAGE.
- **Context Awareness**: The framework is context-aware, which influences embeddings.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Goal of the system.
- **User Interest Modeling**: Modeling users&#39; short-term interests.
- **Recommender Systems**: General category covering all aspects.
- **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)**: Technique used for refining article embeddings.

&#34;Real-world Applications&#34; is a bit broader, but since they tested on a real dataset, it&#39;s applicable. 

I think that covers the necessary categories without being too granular or redundant. Now, listing them in a comma-separated format as required.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Context-aware Graph Embedding for Session-based News Recommendation.&#34; Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Context-aware Graph Embedding&#34; which immediately makes me think of graph-based techniques in recommendation systems. It&#39;s about session-based news recommendations, so that tells me the domain is news, and it&#39;s focused on user interactions within a specific time frameâ€”sessions.

Looking at the abstract: The paper addresses the challenge of online news recommender systems by focusing on users&#39; short-term reading interests. They mention that existing methods don&#39;t leverage semantic structural info among articles or external knowledge sources. Their proposed method is Context-Aware Graph Embedding (CAGE), which uses an auxiliary knowledge graph and graph convolutional networks to refine article embeddings.

So, breaking this down:

1. **Family of Algorithm**: The paper uses graph embedding, specifically with graph convolutional networks. So categories here could be &#34;Graph Embedding&#34; and maybe &#34;Graph Neural Networks.&#34;

2. **Domain of the Problem**: It&#39;s clearly focused on news recommendation, so that&#39;s a direct category.

3. **Specific Aspect in Recommendation Space**: Since it&#39;s session-based, that&#39;s another key categoryâ€”session-based recommendations.

4. **Evaluation Aspects**: The abstract doesn&#39;t explicitly mention evaluation metrics like diversity or beyond accuracy, but since they compare with state-of-the-art methods, maybe &#34;Performance Evaluation&#34; is relevant here.

5. **Real-World Applications**: They used a real-world news dataset, which suggests it&#39;s applicable in real-world scenarios. So categories could include &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; and perhaps &#34;A/B Testing&#34; if they mention any experiments beyond just metrics, but the abstract doesn&#39;t specify that.

6. **Other Relevant Categories**: The use of external knowledge sources implies &#34;Knowledge Graphs.&#34; Also, context-aware methods are a thing in recommendation systems, so that&#39;s another category.

Putting this all together, I need to ensure each article is assigned to at least 8-12 categories. Let me list out possible ones:

- Context-Aware Systems
- News Recommendation
- Session-Based Recommendations
- Graph Embedding
- Knowledge Graphs
- Graph Neural Networks
- Real-World Applications
- Semantic Structural Information
- Performance Evaluation

Wait, that&#39;s nine. I need to make sure they&#39;re all relevant and cover the key points without being too vague or too specific.

I think &#34;Semantic Structural Information&#34; might be a bit broad, so perhaps instead of that, another category like &#34;Context Enrichment&#34; would fit better since they use an auxiliary knowledge graph to enrich context.

Alternatively, maybe &#34;External Knowledge Sources&#34; is more precise. Let me adjust:

- Context-Aware Systems
- News Recommendation
- Session-Based Recommendations
- Graph Embedding
- Knowledge Graphs
- Graph Neural Networks
- Real-World Applications
- External Knowledge Sources
- Performance Evaluation

That&#39;s nine categories. I should check if there are any other relevant ones from the example categories provided earlier, like aspects of evaluation beyond accuracy or scalability. The abstract doesn&#39;t mention scalability issues, so maybe it&#39;s not applicable here.

So, final list:
&lt;/think&gt;

Context-Aware Systems, News Recommendation, Session-Based Recommendations, Graph Embedding, Knowledge Graphs, Graph Neural Networks, Real-World Applications, External Knowledge Sources, Performance Evaluation</code></pre>
