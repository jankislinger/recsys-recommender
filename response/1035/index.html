        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: FairCRS: Towards User-oriented Fairness in Conversational Recommendation Systems
Abstract:
Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRSs) enable recommender systems to explicitly acquire user preferences during multiturn interactions, providing more accurate and personalized recommendations. However, the data imbalance in CRSs, due to inconsistent interaction history among users, may lead to disparate treatment for disadvantaged user groups. In this paper, we investigate the discriminate issues in CRS from the user’s perspective, called as user-oriented fairness. To reveal the unfairness problems of different user groups in CRS, we conduct extensive empirical analyses. To mitigate user unfairness, we propose a user-oriented fairness framework, named FairCRS, which is a model-agnostic framework. In particular, we develop a user-embedding reconstruction mechanism that enriches user embeddings by incorporating more interaction information, and design a user-oriented fairness strategy that optimizes the recommendation quality differences among user groups while alleviating unfairness. Extensive experimental results on English and Chinese datasets show that FairCRS outperforms state-of-the-art CRSs in terms of overall recommendation performance and user fairness.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on the given guidelines. Let&#39;s start by understanding what the article is about.

The title is &#34;FairCRS: Towards User-oriented Fairness in Conversational Recommendation Systems.&#34; The abstract mentions that it deals with Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRSs), which use multi-turn interactions to get user preferences for better recommendations. However, they point out an issue of data imbalance leading to unfair treatment among different user groups. They propose a framework called FairCRS to address this fairness problem.

So, the key elements here are:

1. **Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRSs)**: This is a specific area within recommendation systems.
2. **Fairness and User-oriented Fairness**: The paper addresses fairness issues, specifically from the user&#39;s perspective.
3. **Data Imbalance and Disparate Treatment**: It talks about problems arising from inconsistent interaction history among users.
4. **Model-Agnostic Framework**: FairCRS is a framework that isn&#39;t tied to a specific algorithm, which suggests it can be applied broadly.
5. **User-Embedding Reconstruction**: A technique used in the proposed solution to enhance user embeddings with more interaction data.
6. **Recommendation Quality and User Fairness**: The evaluation metrics include overall performance and fairness across different user groups.

Now, considering the categories provided:

- **Algorithm Family**: Since they mention a model-agnostic framework, but also discuss techniques like user-embedding reconstruction, which could relate to specific methods used in recommendation systems. However, since it&#39;s not tied to a single algorithm family, maybe &#34;User Embedding&#34; is more accurate.
  
- **Domain of Problem**: The domain here is Recommendation Systems, and specifically Conversational Recommendation Systems. So, both categories apply.

- **Specifics in Recommendation Space**: The focus on fairness and handling the cold start problem (due to data imbalance) suggests categories like Fairness, Cold Start, Multi-turn Interaction, and User-Oriented Design.

- **Evaluation Aspects**: They mention optimizing recommendation quality differences and conducting empirical analyses, so categories like Evaluation Metrics and Empirical Analysis fit here.

- **Real-world Applications**: The paper uses datasets from English and Chinese contexts, which might relate to Cross-Cultural Adaptation or Multilingual Support. However, since the article doesn&#39;t specifically discuss A/B testing or user surveys in the abstract, those may not apply directly.

Other relevant categories could include Fairness Frameworks, Data Imbalance Solutions, User Group Analysis, and Multi-Turn Dialogue.

I need to ensure that each category is clear and accurately reflects the content. Also, I should aim for 8-12 categories without overcrowding any single category.

So, compiling all this, here are the categories:

1. Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS)
2. User-Oriented Fairness
3. Fairness in AI/ML
4. Data Imbalance
5. Model-Agnostic Frameworks
6. User Embedding
7. Recommender Systems
8. Multi-Turn Interaction
9.冷启动问题（Cold Start Problem）：虽然文中提到数据不平衡可能导致冷启动，但可能更准确的翻译是“冷启动”。
10. 用户分组分析（User Group Analysis）：文中讨论了不同用户群体间的不公平现象。
11. 评价指标（Evaluation Metrics）：如推荐质量差异等。
12. 实证分析（Empirical Analysis）：文中进行了广泛的经验分析。

I think that covers all the key aspects of the article.
&lt;/think&gt;
