Title: Uncovering User Interest from Biased and Noised Watch Time in Video Recommendation
Abstract:
In micro-video recommendation scenarios, watch time is commonly adopted as an indicator of users’ interest. However, watch time is not only determined by the matching of users’ interests but is affected by other factors. These factors mainly lie in two folds: on the one hand, users tend to spend more time on those charming videos with the growth of the duration (i.e., video length), named as duration bias; on the other hand, it costs people a period of time to judge whether they like the video, named as noisy watching. Consequently, the existence of duration bias and noisy watching make watch time an inadequate label for training a reliable recommendation model. Moreover, current methods focus only on the duration bias and ignore the duration noise, so they do not really uncover the user interest from watch time. In this study, we first analyze the generation mechanism of users’ watch time in a unified causal viewpoint. Unlike current methods, which only notice the duration bias in watch time, we considered the watch time as a mixture of the user’s actual interest, the duration biased watch time, and the noisy watch time. To mitigate both the duration bias and noisy watching, we propose Debiased and Denoised watch time Correction (D$^2$Co), which can be divided into two steps: First, we employ a duration-wise Gaussian Mixture Model plus frequency-weighted moving average for estimating the bias and noise terms; Then we utilize a sensitivity-controlled correction function to separate the user interest from the watch time, which is robust to the estimation error of bias and noise terms. The experiments on two public video recommendation datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its content, themes, and relevance. The goal is to ensure that users can easily explore and discover the article through a user-friendly interface.

First, let&#39;s look at the title: &#34;Uncovering User Interest from Biased and Noised Watch Time in Video Recommendation.&#34; This immediately tells me it&#39;s related to video recommendations, so I&#39;ll add Video Recommendations as one category.

The abstract mentions that watch time is used as an indicator of user interest but is affected by duration bias and noisy watching. Duration bias refers to users spending more time on longer videos, while noisy watching involves the initial period where users decide if they like a video. These concepts are specific issues in recommendation systems, so I&#39;ll include Duration Bias and Noisy Watching as separate categories.

The study proposes a method called D²Co (Debiased and Denoised watch time Correction) which uses techniques like Gaussian Mixture Model and moving average. This indicates the article is about developing algorithms for recommendation systems, so Algorithm Development is another category.

Since the article discusses how to correct for biases and noises in watch time data, it&#39;s related to Data Cleaning or Preprocessing. So I&#39;ll add that as a category too.

The main focus is on improving recommendation models by better understanding user interest despite noisy and biased data. This falls under User Interest Modeling. Therefore, I include that.

The article addresses the challenges of training reliable recommendation models with imperfect data, which touches on Training Challenges in recommendation systems.

They mention using public datasets for experiments, so Data Analysis is a relevant category.

Their approach involves separating user interest from watch time by correcting biases and noises, so Signal Processing is another appropriate category.

Lastly, their solution aims to enhance recommendation accuracy by handling these issues, making Recommendation Accuracy an important category.

Putting it all together, the categories are: Video Recommendations, Duration Bias, Noisy Watching, Algorithm Development, Data Cleaning/Preprocessing, User Interest Modeling, Training Challenges, Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Recommendation Accuracy.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let&#39;s break it down step by step.

The title is &#34;Uncovering User Interest from Biased and Noisy Watch Time in Video Recommendation.&#34; Right away, I can tell that the focus is on recommendation systems, specifically video recommendations. They&#39;re looking at watch time data but noting that this data isn&#39;t perfect because of biases and noise.

Looking at the abstract: The article talks about duration bias—where longer videos get more watch time regardless of user interest—and noisy watching, which refers to the initial period where users aren&#39;t sure if they like the video. These factors make watch time a unreliable indicator for training recommendation models. Current methods only address one issue or the other, so this study proposes D²Co, a method to correct both duration bias and noise.

So, the key themes here are:

1. **Recommendation Systems**: Since it&#39;s about video recommendations.
2. **Bias in Data**: They specifically mention duration bias and noisy data affecting watch time.
3. **Noise Handling**: The article addresses both types of noise, so this is relevant.
4. **User Behavior Analysis**: Understanding how users interact with videos and their watch time.
5. **Evaluation Methods**: They use experiments on datasets to validate their approach.
6. **Causality**: The study uses a causal viewpoint to analyze the generation mechanism of watch time.

Other aspects include:

- **Video recommendation** is specific, so that&#39;s another category.
- **Watch Time Analysis**: Since they&#39;re focusing on how watch time is used and its flaws.
- **Data Cleaning/Preprocessing**: Because they are correcting for bias and noise in data.
- **Causal Inference**: As mentioned earlier.

I should make sure each category is clear and relevant. Also, the article might not directly mention all these terms, but based on the content, these categories align with its focus areas. I need to assign at least 8 categories as per guidelines.

Let me list them out:

- Recommendation Systems
- Bias in Data
- Noise Handling
- User Behavior Analysis
- Evaluation Methods
- Causality
- Video Recommendation
- Watch Time Analysis

Wait, that&#39;s eight, but maybe I can add more if applicable. Let&#39;s check the abstract again for any other relevant aspects.

They talk about using Gaussian Mixture Model and moving average as part of their method, so perhaps something related to machine learning techniques? But since the categories are broader concepts rather than specific methods, I think sticking with higher-level categories is better.

Another thought: The problem they&#39;re addressing relates to feature engineering or data preprocessing. So maybe &#34;Data Preprocessing&#34; could be another category. Also, they propose a model that corrects watch time, so perhaps &#34;Correction Models.&#34;

Wait, but the guidelines suggest using clear, descriptive keywords. So I should avoid being too vague or too specific.

Alternatively, considering the problem is about improving recommendation accuracy by handling biases and noise, maybe categories like &#34;Recommendation Accuracy&#34; could be relevant. But it&#39;s not explicitly mentioned in the example output.

Hmm, perhaps sticking to the key themes as identified before is better. The initial list seems comprehensive enough without making categories too narrow or overlapping.

So finalizing on these eight categories should cover all the necessary aspects for discoverability and user navigation.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommendation Systems, Bias in Data, Noise Handling, User Behavior Analysis, Evaluation Methods, Causality, Video Recommendation, Watch Time Analysis</code></pre>
