Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Exploration in Recommender Systems
Abstract:
In the era of increasing choices, recommender systems are becoming indispensable in helping users navigate the million or billion pieces of content on recommendation platforms. As the focus of these systems shifts from attracting short-term user attention toward optimizing long term user experience on these platforms, reinforcement learning (and bandits) have emerged as appealing techniques to power these systems [5, 9, 26, 27]. The exploration-exploitation tradeoff, being the foundation of bandits and RL research, has been extensively studied [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23]. An agent is incentivized to exploit to maximize its return, i.e., by repeating actions taken in the past that produced high rewards. On the other hand, the agent needs to explore previously unseen actions in order to discover potentially better ones. Exploration has been shown to be extremely useful in solving tasks of long horizons or sparse reward in many RL applications [2, 14, 15, 16, 19]. While effective exploration is believed to positively influence the user experience on the platform, the exact value of exploration in recommender systems has not been well established.
In this talk, we examine the roles of exploration in recommender systems in three facets: 1) system exploration to reduce system uncertainty in regions with sparse feedback; 2) user exploration to introduce users to new interests/tastes; and 3) online exploration to take into account real-time user feedback. We showcase how each aspect of exploration contributes to the long term user experience through offline and live experiments on industrial recommendation platforms. We hope this talk can inspire more follow up work in understanding and improving exploration in recommender systems.

Okay, I need to assign categories to this research article titled &#34;Exploration in Recommender Systems.&#34; Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title suggests that the focus is on exploration within recommendation systems. The abstract mentions reinforcement learning and bandits, which are key techniques in handling the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. So, categories related to these should definitely be included.

Next, looking at the content, the article discusses three facets of exploration: system, user, and online (real-time). This indicates that categories like &#34;User Exploration,&#34; &#34;System Exploration,&#34; and &#34;Online Exploration&#34; would be relevant. Also, since they talk about long-term user experience, a category for that makes sense.

The abstract also mentions experiments on industrial platforms, so &#34;Industrial Applications&#34; is appropriate. They discuss real-time feedback, which fits into &#34;Real-Time Feedback.&#34; The exploration-exploitation tradeoff itself is a fundamental concept here, so that should be another category.

Reinforcement learning and multi-armed bandits are specific algorithms used, so those categories are necessary. Since the study involves experiments, both offline and online, including &#34;Offline Experiments&#34; and &#34;Online Experiments&#34; adds depth.

The article is about enhancing user experience through exploration, so &#34;User Experience Enhancement&#34; is a good fit. Lastly, as it&#39;s a talk meant to inspire further research, &#34;Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff&#34; ties everything together, showing the core challenge being addressed.

I need to ensure each category is clear and specific enough but also broad to be useful. Let me count how many categories I&#39;ve identified—looks like 11. That falls within the recommended 8-12 range, so it should provide good coverage without overwhelming users.

I think these categories cover all aspects of the article: techniques used (reinforcement learning, bandits), types of exploration (system, user, online), applications (industrial), evaluation methods (experiments), and core concepts (exploration-exploitation). This should make it easy for users to find related content and navigate the interface effectively.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Exploration in Recommender Systems.&#34; Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title immediately tells me it&#39;s about exploration within recommender systems. The abstract mentions that recommender systems are important for helping users navigate a lot of content, shifting from short-term attention to long-term user experience. It also talks about reinforcement learning (RL) and bandits as techniques being used here.

Looking deeper, the article discusses the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, which is fundamental in bandit algorithms and RL. The abstract highlights that while exploration is useful in many RL applications, its exact value in recommender systems isn&#39;t well established yet. They examine three facets of exploration: system exploration to handle sparse feedback areas, user exploration to introduce new interests, and online exploration considering real-time feedback. They use experiments on industrial platforms to show how each contributes to long-term user experience.

Now, I&#39;ll map this into categories based on the guidelines provided. The article is about recommender systems, so that&#39;s a primary category. It uses reinforcement learning and bandits as techniques, so those should be included. Since it focuses on exploration strategies and their impact, categories like Exploration Strategy, User Experience, and Online Experimentation seem relevant.

The abstract mentions reducing system uncertainty in sparse feedback regions, which ties into Sparse Feedback Handling. It&#39;s also about long-term user experience, touching on aspects like engagement and satisfaction over time—so Long-Term Engagement makes sense. The experiments they conducted are in an industrial setting, so Industrial Applications should be a category as well.

They discuss how exploration introduces users to new interests, which relates to User Interests. Additionally, the talk aims to inspire follow-up work, indicating it&#39;s more of a foundational or survey-type article, hence Foundational Research.

I should ensure that each category is both specific and broad enough. For example, Recommender Systems is broad but necessary, while Exploration Strategy is more specific. I also need to cover different angles: techniques used (RL, Bandits), aspects addressed (exploration, user experience), evaluation methods (online experimentation), application context (industrial), and the nature of the research (foundational).

I think that covers all the main points without overlapping too much. Let me make sure each category is clear and accurately reflects the content.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommender Systems, Reinforcement Learning, Bandits, Exploration Strategy, User Experience, Online Experimentation, Sparse Feedback Handling, Long-Term Engagement, Industrial Applications, User Interests, Foundational Research</code></pre>
