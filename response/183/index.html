        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Recommending New Items to Ephemeral Groups Using Contextual User Influence
Abstract:
Group recommender systems help groups of users in finding appropriate items to be enjoyed together. Lots of activities, like watching TV or going to the restaurant, are intrinsically group-based, thus making the group recommendation problem very relevant. In this paper we study ephemeral groups, i.e., groups where the members might be together for the first time. Recent approaches have tackled this issue introducing complex models to be learned offline, making them unable to deal with new items; on the contrary, we propose a group recommender able to manage new items too. In more detail, our technique determines the preference of a group for an item by combining the individual preferences of the group members on the basis of their contextual influence, where the contextual influence represents the ability of an individual, in a given situation, to direct the groupâ€™s decision. We conducted an extensive experimental evaluation on a TV dataset containing a log of viewings performed by real groups, showing how our approach outperforms the comparable techniques from the literature.

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task step by step. I&#39;m looking at an article titled &#34;Recommending New Items to Ephemeral Groups Using Contextual User Influence&#34; with a detailed abstract. My goal is to assign it to multiple relevant categories as per the guidelines provided.

First, I&#39;ll start by analyzing the title and abstract to identify core themes. The paper focuses on group recommender systems, specifically for ephemeral groups where members might not have interacted before. It introduces a method that considers contextual user influence to determine group preferences for new items, using a TV dataset as part of their evaluation.

So, the main areas here are group recommendations and handling new or unseen items. The approach involves contextual factors influencing user decisions within groups. They also conducted experiments on real-world data, which includes aspects like user behavior analysis and dataset usage.

Now, mapping these themes to categories:

1. **Group Recommender Systems**: Directly from the title and focus of the paper.
2. **Ephemeral Groups**: A specific type of group mentioned in the abstract.
3. **Contextual User Influence**: Central concept discussed in how preferences are determined.
4. **New Items Recommendation**: Deals with recommending items that haven&#39;t been seen before by the system, which is a key contribution.
5. **Collaborative Filtering**: Since it&#39;s about combining individual preferences to make group recommendations.
6. **User Behavior Analysis**: As they evaluate based on viewing logs and user interactions.
7. **Experimental Evaluation**: They conducted experiments using a TV dataset.
8. **Real-World Applications**: The evaluation is done on real data, indicating practical application.
9. **Preference Aggregation**: Combining individual preferences into group decisions.
10. **Cold Start Problem**: Since they address new items, which relates to the cold start issue in recommendation systems.

I think these categories cover both the specific aspects of the paper (like ephemeral groups and contextual influence) as well as broader areas it contributes to (such as collaborative filtering and evaluation methods). I&#39;ll also consider if there are any other relevant areas but these seem comprehensive enough based on the abstract.
&lt;/think&gt;
