        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: A Probabilistic Position Bias Model for Short-Video Recommendation Feeds
Abstract:
Modern web-based platforms often show ranked lists of recommendations to users, in an attempt to maximise user satisfaction or business metrics. Typically, the goal of such systems boils down to maximising the exposure probability — conversely, minimising the rank— for items that are deemed “reward-maximising” according to some metric of interest. This general framing comprises music or movie streaming applications, as well as e-commerce, restaurant or job recommendations, and even web search. Position bias or user models can be used to estimate exposure probabilities for each use-case, specifically tailored to how users interact with the presented rankings. A unifying factor in these diverse problem settings is that typically only one or several items will be engaged with (clicked, streamed, purchased, et cetera) before a user leaves the ranked list.  Short-video feeds on social media platforms diverge from this general framing in several ways, most notably that users do not tend to leave the feed after, for example, liking a post. Indeed, seemingly infinite feeds invite users to scroll further down the ranked list. For this reason, existing position bias or user models tend to fall short in such settings, as they do not accurately capture users’ interaction modalities. In this work, we propose a novel and probabilistically sound personalised position bias model for feed recommendations. We focus on a 1st-level feed in a hierarchical structure, where users may enter a 2nd-level feed via any given 1st-level item. We posit that users come to the platform with a given scrolling budget that is drawn according to a discrete power-law distribution, and show how the survival function of said distribution can be used to obtain closed-form estimates for personalised exposure probabilities. Empirical insights gained through data from a large-scale social media platform show how our probabilistic position bias model more accurately captures empirical exposure than existing models, and paves the way for improved unbiased evaluation and learning-to-rank.

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about a probabilistic position bias model for short-video recommendations. Let me break down the title and abstract to understand what it&#39;s about.

The title mentions &#34;Probabilistic Position Bias Model&#34; which suggests it&#39;s dealing with how items are ranked in recommendation feeds, particularly for short videos on social media platforms. The abstract explains that traditional systems aim to maximize exposure probability by minimizing rank for reward-maximizing items. It gives examples like music, movies, e-commerce, etc., but notes that short-video feeds differ because users don&#39;t leave after engaging with one item; they keep scrolling.

So the article is proposing a new model that addresses this specific interaction pattern. They talk about a &#34;scrolling budget&#34; and use a discrete power-law distribution to estimate exposure probabilities more accurately. The empirical results show their model improves evaluation and learning-to-rank processes.

Now, applying the guidelines: I need at least 8-12 categories. Let&#39;s start with the algorithm family. It seems like it&#39;s related to recommendation algorithms, specifically probabilistic models. So &#34;Probabilistic Models&#34; is one category.

The problem domain here is short-video recommendations on social media feeds, so &#34;Short-Video Recommendations&#34; and &#34;Social Media Platforms&#34; are relevant. The broader domain would include recommendation systems in general, so that&#39;s another category.

Looking at aspects of evaluation, the article mentions unbiased evaluation and learning-to-rank, which ties into metrics like exposure probability and user engagement. So categories like &#34;Exposure Probability&#34;, &#34;User Engagement&#34;, and &#34;Learning to Rank&#34; make sense here.

They address a specific problem in recommendation feeds where users scroll infinitely, so &#34;Position Bias Models&#34; is another category. The model they propose is personalized, hence &#34;Personalized Recommendations&#34;.

The article also discusses empirical insights from real-world data, which implies it has practical applications through A/B testing or user surveys, so &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; and &#34;Empirical Analysis&#34; are appropriate.

Additionally, the focus on scrolling behavior suggests categories related to user interaction patterns and hierarchical structures in feeds. So &#34;User Interaction Patterns&#34; and &#34;Hierarchical Feed Structures&#34; could be included.

Putting it all together, I should ensure these categories are clear and cover both specific aspects of the article and broader themes relevant to users looking for similar content.
