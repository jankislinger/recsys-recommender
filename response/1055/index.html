        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Prompt Tuning for Item Cold-start Recommendation
Abstract:
The item cold-start problem is crucial for online recommender systems, as the success of the cold-start phase determines whether items can transition into popular ones. Prompt learning, a powerful technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to address zero- or few-shot problems, has been adapted for recommender systems to tackle similar challenges. However, existing methods typically rely on content-based properties or text descriptions for prompting, which we argue may be suboptimal for cold-start recommendations due to 1) semantic gaps with recommender tasks, 2) model bias caused by warm-up items contribute most of positive feedback to the model, which is the core of the cold-start problem that hinder the recommender quality on cold-start items. We propose to leverage high-value positive feedback, termed pinnacle feedback as prompt information, to simultaneously resolve the above two problems. We experimentally prove that comparing to content description proposed in existing works, the positive feedback is more suitable to serve as prompt information by bridging the semantic gaps. Besides, we propose item-wise personalized prompt networks to encode pinnaclce feedback to relieve the model bias by the positive feedback dominance problem. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, PROMO has been successfully deployed on a popular short-video sharing platform, a billion-user scale commercial short-video application, achieving remarkable performance gains across various commercial metrics within cold-start scenarios.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Alright, I need to categorize this research article about &#34;Prompt Tuning for Item Cold-Start Recommendation.&#34; Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Item Cold-Start,&#34; which immediately tells me one of the main categories is Cold Start. The problem addressed here is crucial for recommender systems when handling new items, so that&#39;s a primary category.

Looking at the abstract, they discuss prompt learning from NLP being adapted for recommendation systems. So, Prompt Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are relevant categories here. They mention using high-value positive feedback as prompt information, which relates to Feedback Mechanisms.

The article talks about resolving semantic gaps and model bias caused by warm-up items. Semantic Gaps refers to the challenge of aligning prompts with recommendation tasks, so that&#39;s another category. Model Bias is also a key issue addressed, so I&#39;ll include that.

They propose item-wise personalized prompt networks, which suggests Personalization is a significant aspect. The deployment on a short-video platform indicates Real-World Applications and A/B Testing since they probably tested the effectiveness in real scenarios.

The evaluation shows superiority over state-of-the-art methods, touching on Evaluation Metrics. They used feedback to bridge gaps, so Feedback-Based Methods is relevant. Lastly, Recommender Systems is the overarching category.

Putting it all together, these categories cover the article&#39;s focus areas and align with user interests in recommendation technology.
