Title: Unbiased Implicit Recommendation and Propensity Estimation via Combinational Joint Learning
Abstract:
This paper focuses on how to generate unbiased recommendations based on biased implicit user-item interactions. We propose a combinational joint learning framework to simultaneously learn unbiased user-item relevance and unbiased propensity. More specifically, we first present a new unbiased objective function for estimating propensity. We then show how a naïve joint learning approach faces an estimation-training overlap problem. Hence, we propose to jointly train multiple sub-models from different parts of the training dataset to avoid this problem. Finally, we show how to incorporate residual components trained by the complete training data to complement the relevance and propensity sub-models. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model with an improvement of 4% on average over the best alternatives.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. The goal is to make it easy for users to find the article when they&#39;re exploring different topics.

First, looking at the title: &#34;Unbiased Implicit Recommendation and Propensity Estimation via Combinational Joint Learning.&#34; Hmm, that tells me it&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically dealing with implicit data. The term &#39;unbiased&#39; suggests it&#39;s addressing some kind of bias in recommendations, which is a common issue in machine learning.

The abstract says they&#39;re working on generating unbiased recommendations from biased implicit user interactions. They use a combinational joint learning framework to estimate both relevance and propensity without bias. They also mention an estimation-training overlap problem and how they solve it by training multiple sub-models on different parts of the dataset, then combining them with residual components.

So, breaking this down, the core themes are recommendation systems, implicit feedback, unbiased recommendations, and joint learning. The paper also talks about addressing biases in collaborative filtering and propensity estimation, which is a method used to adjust for selection bias in recommendation engines.

I need to assign at least 8-12 categories. Let me think of the main areas:

1. **Recommendation Systems**: This is clearly central because the entire focus is on improving recommendations.
2. **Implicit Feedback**: The article deals with implicit data, which is user behavior rather than explicit ratings.
3. **Bias Correction**: It&#39;s about making recommendations unbiased, so this category makes sense.
4. **Collaborative Filtering**: Since it&#39;s a recommendation method that often uses user-item interactions.
5. **Propensity Estimation**: This term comes up in the abstract as part of their approach.
6. **Joint Learning**: The framework they use combines different models.
7. **Unbiased Recommendations**: Directly from the title and focus of the paper.
8. **Machine Learning**: It&#39;s a broader category that encompasses all these techniques.

Are there more categories? Let me think about aspects like evaluation or applications mentioned in the abstract. They did experiments on public datasets, showing effectiveness with an improvement of 4%. So maybe:

9. **Evaluation Metrics**: Since they discuss effectiveness.
10. **Model Training**: They talk about training sub-models and combining them.

Wait, but should I include something about the domain? The paper doesn&#39;t specify a particular application like e-commerce or movies, so maybe not. But perhaps &#34;Bias in Machine Learning&#34; is another category, as it&#39;s about correcting bias beyond just recommendations.

So adding that:

11. **Bias in Machine Learning**: To highlight the general approach to bias correction.

And since they use joint learning and model training techniques, perhaps:

12. **Model Combination**: Because they combine sub-models and residual components.

That gives me 12 categories. Let me list them again to make sure each is relevant and covers different aspects of the paper:

- Recommendation Systems: Direct topic.
- Implicit Feedback: Type of data used.
- Bias Correction: Key problem addressed.
- Collaborative Filtering: Methodology aspect.
- Propensity Estimation: Technique used.
- Joint Learning: Framework approach.
- Unbiased Recommendations: Specific goal.
- Machine Learning: Broader field.
- Evaluation Metrics: Mentioned through experiments.
- Model Training: Discussing how models are trained.
- Bias in Machine Learning: General application of bias correction.
- Model Combination: Technique for combining sub-models.

I think these cover the main points without overlapping too much. Each category is distinct and relevant, which should help users find the article when exploring different facets of recommendation systems or machine learning topics.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories. The title is &#34;Unbiased Implicit Recommendation and Propensity Estimation via Combinational Joint Learning.&#34; Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.

The paper deals with generating unbiased recommendations using biased implicit user-item interactions. They propose a framework that simultaneously learns user-item relevance and propensity in an unbiased way. They mention an objective function for estimating propensity, a joint learning approach that avoids estimation-training overlap issues, and they use multiple sub-models trained on different parts of the dataset. The experiments show improvement over existing methods.

Looking at the key points: it&#39;s about implicit recommendations, dealing with bias, using a joint learning framework, sub-models to avoid overlap, and evaluation through experiments.

Now, considering the categories provided in the example:

1. **Family of Algorithm**: They mention a framework involving multiple sub-models, which sounds like it might be an extension of existing recommendation algorithms but not exactly one specific family like Matrix Factorization or Bandits. Maybe this is more about methodology rather than a specific algorithm family.

2. **Domain of Problem**: The paper focuses on recommendations, so &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; would fit here.

3. **Specific Aspect in Recommendation Space**: They talk about unbiased recommendations and propensity estimation, which are both specific aspects. So categories like &#34;Implicit Feedback,&#34; since they&#39;re dealing with implicit interactions, and &#34;Unbiased Recommendations.&#34;

4. **Evaluation Aspects**: The paper mentions effectiveness through experiments on two datasets, but it doesn&#39;t specify the evaluation metrics beyond improvement over alternatives. So maybe not a direct fit here.

5. **Real-World Applications**: They don&#39;t explicitly mention real-world applications like A/B testing or user surveys; their focus is more on methodology.

6. **Other Relevant Categorizations**: Since they&#39;re dealing with joint learning and sub-models, perhaps &#34;Propensity Estimation&#34; as a category. Also, the method of avoiding overlap might relate to model training techniques, but maybe that&#39;s too specific.

Putting it all together, I need at least 8 categories, so I should think of more relevant ones. Maybe &#34;Bias in Recommendations,&#34; since they&#39;re addressing bias. They also talk about estimation and learning, so perhaps &#34;Estimation Methods&#34; or &#34;Learning Frameworks.&#34; Alternatively, considering the approach uses joint training across sub-models, maybe a category related to model architecture.

Wait, another angle: the framework involves combining multiple models, which could fall under &#34;Ensemble Learning&#34; but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s exactly applicable. Or perhaps it&#39;s more about collaborative filtering methods since recommendation systems often use those.

So revising my thoughts:

- **Unbiased Recommendations**: Directly related to their focus.
- **Implicit Feedback**: As they work with implicit interactions.
- **Recommendation Systems**: General category for the field.
- **Propensity Estimation**: Specific method they use.
- **Bias in Recommendations**: Another key aspect of their research.
- **Joint Learning**: The approach taken in the paper.
- **User-Item Relevance**: Core concept in recommendations.

I think I have seven categories. Let me see if there&#39;s another relevant one. Maybe &#34;Framework&#34; as a category, but it&#39;s too vague. Alternatively, perhaps &#34;Model Training Techniques,&#34; but that might not capture it exactly.

Alternatively, considering the method of using multiple sub-models to avoid overlap could be seen under something like &#34;Multi-Task Learning,&#34; but I&#39;m not sure if that applies here since they&#39;re training different parts rather than tasks.

I think sticking with the categories I have is better. So I&#39;ll list them as:

Unbiased Recommendations, Implicit Feedback, Recommendation Systems, Propensity Estimation, Bias in Recommendations, Joint Learning, User-Item Relevance.
&lt;/think&gt;

Unbiased Recommendations, Implicit Feedback, Recommendation Systems, Propensity Estimation, Bias in Recommendations, Joint Learning, User-Item Relevance</code></pre>
