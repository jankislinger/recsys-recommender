        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Towards Automatic Meal Plan Recommendations for Balanced Nutrition
Abstract:
Food recommenders have been touted as a useful tool to help people achieve a healthy diet. Here we incorporate nutrition into the recommender problem by examining the feasibility of algorithmically creating daily meal plans for a sample of user profiles (n=100), combined with a diverse set of food preference data (n=64) collected in a natural setting. Our analyses demonstrate it is possible to recommend plans for a large percentage of users which meet the guidelines set out by international health agencies.

Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about automatic meal plan recommendations. The title mentions &#34;Automatic Meal Plan Recommendations for Balanced Nutrition,&#34; and the abstract talks about food recommenders helping people achieve healthy diets. They looked at user profiles and food preferences, aiming to meet international health guidelines.

First, looking at the family of algorithms, since they&#39;re creating meal plans, they might be using optimization techniques. So I&#39;ll include Optimization Algorithms.

The domain here is clearly Food and Nutrition because it&#39;s all about meal planning based on nutrition guidelines.

In terms of recommendation specifics, this falls under Personalized Recommendations because it tailors meal plans to individual user profiles.

The evaluation aspect likely involves User Preferences since they collected data on food preferences. It&#39;s also about Health Outcomes as they aim to meet health agency guidelines.

They mention real-world applications with a sample of users and their data, so that fits into Real-World Applications.

The goal is balanced nutrition, which ties into both the domain (Food &amp; Nutrition) and aspects like Diversity because they need varied meal plans that still meet nutritional standards. So I&#39;ll add Diversity of Recommendations.

Additionally, since it&#39;s about creating daily plans algorithmically, Algorithmic Design makes sense as a category to highlight how they structure their approach.

Considering all these points, the categories should cover the technical (algorithms), domain-specific (food), recommendation aspects, evaluation criteria, and real-world impact. I&#39;ll make sure each category is broad enough but still specific to be useful for users searching in this area.
&lt;/think&gt;
