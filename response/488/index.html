Title: PAL: A Position-bias Aware Learning Framework for CTR Prediction in Live Recommender Systems
Abstract:
Predicting Click-Through Rate (CTR) accurately is crucial in recommender systems. In general, a CTR model is trained based on user feedback which is collected from offline traffic logs. However, position-bias exists in user feedback because a user clicks on an item may not only because she favors it but also because it is in a good position. One way is to model position as a feature in the training data, which is widely used in industrial applications due to its simplicity. Specifically, a default position value has to be used to predict CTR in online inference since the actual position information is not available at that time. However, using different default position values may result in completely different recommendation results. As a result, this approach leads to sub-optimal online performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Position-bias Aware Learning framework (PAL) for CTR prediction in a live recommender system. It is able to model the position-bias in offline training and conduct online inference without position information. Extensive online experiments are conducted to demonstrate that PAL outperforms the baselines by 3% â€“ 35% in terms of CTR and CVR in a three-week AB test. i&gt;Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch&lt;/i

Okay, I need to categorize this research article based on the given guidelines. The title is &#34;PAL: A Position-bias Aware Learning Framework for CTR Prediction in Live Recommender Systems,&#34; and the abstract discusses how PAL addresses position-bias in click-through rate prediction.

First, I&#39;ll identify core themes from the title and abstract. The main topics are CTR Prediction, Recommender Systems, and Position-Bias. It&#39;s clear that this is about improving recommendation accuracy by accounting for how item positions affect user clicks.

Looking at the example categories provided, some relevant ones include &#34;Click-Through Rate Prediction&#34; since it&#39;s central to the paper. Also, since they mention real-world applications like A/B Testing in live systems, that should be another category.

The framework is specifically designed for recommender systems, so &#34;Recommender Systems&#34; and more specifically, &#34;Live Recommender Systems,&#34; makes sense. Position-bias is a key aspect here, so &#34;Position Bias&#34; should definitely be included.

They talk about using models in real-world scenarios, which falls under &#34;Real-World Applications.&#34; The paper also discusses evaluation beyond just accuracy, mentioning improvements in CTR and CVR, so &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; fits as an evaluation aspect.

The framework is a learning method, so &#34;Learning Frameworks&#34; is appropriate. Since it&#39;s dealing with ranking and position effects, &#34;Ranking Models&#34; and &#34;Position-Aware Models&#34; are also relevant categories.

I should make sure to cover multiple aspects: the problem domain (recommender systems), specific techniques used (learning frameworks), evaluation methods, and real-world applications. I have around 9 categories here, which fits within the suggested 8-12 range.

Now, I&#39;ll list them out clearly, ensuring each is descriptive and user-friendly.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on the given guidelines. The title is &#34;PAL: A Position-bias Aware Learning Framework for CTR Prediction in Live Recommender Systems&#34; and the abstract discusses issues with position bias in user feedback affecting CTR models.

First, looking at the title, it mentions CTR prediction, which stands for Click-Through Rate prediction. That&#39;s a key area in recommendation systems. So I should include &#34;Click-Through Rate (CTR)&#34; as one category.

The framework is called PAL, and it&#39;s designed to be position-bias aware. Position bias refers to how the placement of items affects user interactions. Therefore, categories like &#34;Position Bias&#34; and &#34;Bias Correction&#34; seem appropriate because the paper addresses this specific issue in recommendation systems.

Since the framework is applied within live recommender systems, that&#39;s a clear category: &#34;Recommender Systems.&#34; Additionally, since they&#39;re dealing with real-time data without position information during inference, it relates to online learning. So &#34;Online Learning&#34; should be included.

The problem of position bias leads to suboptimal recommendations because different default positions can change the results. This touches on recommendation accuracy and performance. Therefore, categories like &#34;Recommendation Accuracy,&#34; &#34;Performance Optimization,&#34; and &#34;Bias in Recommendations&#34; are relevant.

They conducted extensive online experiments with A/B tests, showing improvements over baselines. So the category &#34;A/B Testing&#34; is appropriate as it&#39;s a real-world application method they used to validate their approach.

The paper focuses on improving recommendation systems by addressing position bias, so another broad category could be &#34;Recommendation Systems.&#34; Additionally, since PAL adjusts for biases in user feedback, &#34;Feedback Adjustment&#34; makes sense.

Putting it all together, I need at least 8-12 categories. Let me see if I missed anything. The abstract mentions live systems and real-world applications through A/B tests. Also, the framework handles online inference without position info, which ties into handling uncertainty or missing data during recommendation. So maybe &#34;Online Inference&#34; is another category.

Wait, but in the initial list, I had 12 categories: CTR, Position Bias, Recommender Systems, Online Learning, Recommendation Accuracy, A/B Testing, Performance Optimization, Real-World Applications, Bias Correction, Bias in Recommendations, Feedback Adjustment, and PAL Framework. That&#39;s 12. Alternatively, if I need more, perhaps include &#34;Handling Missing Data&#34; or &#34;Real-Time Recommendations,&#34; but since the abstract doesn&#39;t explicitly mention those beyond what&#39;s already covered, maybe stick with the existing ones.

So, finalizing the categories based on the content and ensuring they are descriptive and cover all aspects discussed in the title and abstract.
&lt;/think&gt;

Click-Through Rate (CTR), Position Bias, Recommender Systems, Online Learning, Recommendation Accuracy, A/B Testing, Performance Optimization, Real-World Applications, Bias Correction, Bias in Recommendations, Feedback Adjustment, PAL Framework</code></pre>
