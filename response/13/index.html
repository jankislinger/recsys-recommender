        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Context Adaptation in Interactive Recommender Systems
Abstract:
Contextual factors can greatly influence the utility of recommendations for users. In many recommendation and personalization applications, particularly in domains where user context changes dynamically, it is difficult to represent and model contextual factors directly, but it is often possible to observe their impact on user preferences during the course of users’ interactions with the system. In this paper, we introduce an interactive recommender system that can detect and adapt to changes in context based on the user’s ongoing behavior. The system, then, dynamically tailors its recommendations to match the user’s most recent preferences. We formulate this problem as a multi-armed bandit problem and use Thompson sampling heuristic to learn a model for the user. Following the Thompson sampling approach, the user model is updated after each interaction as the system observes the corresponding rewards for the recommendations provided during that interaction. To generate contextual recommendations, the user’s preference model is monitored for changes at each step of interaction with the user and is updated incrementally. We will introduce a mechanism for detecting significant changes in the user’s preferences and will describe how it can be used to improve the performance of the recommender system.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. The goal is to help users easily find and explore content by assigning each article to at least 8-12 categories.

First, looking at the title: &#34;Context Adaptation in Interactive Recommender Systems.&#34; This tells me that the main topic is about how recommendation systems adapt to changing user contexts through interaction.

The abstract mentions that contextual factors influence recommendations. It talks about domains where user context changes dynamically and discusses detecting these changes using a multi-armed bandit approach with Thompson sampling. The system updates its model after each interaction based on rewards from user behavior, which suggests it&#39;s dealing with dynamic user preferences and real-time adaptation.

So, starting with the algorithm family, the paper uses Thompson Sampling, which falls under Multi-Armed Bandits. That gives me two categories: Multi-Armed Bandits and Thompson Sampling.

Next, the domain here is interactive recommendation systems where context plays a crucial role. Since it&#39;s about adapting to user behavior dynamically, I can consider General Recommendation as the broader category. 

The abstract emphasizes dynamic modeling of user preferences, so Dynamic Modeling is another relevant category. Context Adaptation fits directly with the title and main focus.

They mention that the system updates its model incrementally after each interaction, which points towards Incremental Updates. Since each interaction provides rewards, this involves Real-Time Adaptation to ensure recommendations stay current with user preferences.

Looking at evaluation aspects, the paper likely discusses how these changes affect recommendation quality over time, so Online Evaluation makes sense here.

The problem formulation as a multi-armed bandit and use of Thompson sampling for learning the user model suggests Contextual Recommendations. 

Lastly, while not explicitly stated, the approach implies that the system can handle changing contexts without requiring retraining from scratch, which relates to Adaptivity in recommendation systems.

Putting it all together, I have: Multi-Armed Bandits, Thompson Sampling, General Recommendation, Dynamic Modeling, Context Adaptation, Interactive Systems, Incremental Updates, Real-Time Adaptation, Online Evaluation, and Contextual Recommendations. That&#39;s 10 categories, which fits the requirement of 8-12.
&lt;/think&gt;

Multi-Armed Bandits, Thompson Sampling, General Recommendation, Dynamic Modeling, Context Adaptation, Interactive Systems, Incremental Updates, Real-Time Adaptation, Online Evaluation, Contextual Recommendations</code></pre>
