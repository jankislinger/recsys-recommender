Title: Carousel Personalization in Music Streaming Apps with Contextual Bandits
Abstract:
Media services providers, such as music streaming platforms, frequently leverage swipeable carousels to recommend personalized content to their users. However, selecting the most relevant items (albums, artists, playlists...) to display in these carousels is a challenging task, as items are numerous and as users have different preferences. In this paper, we model carousel personalization as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem with multiple plays, stochastic arm display and delayed batch feedback. We empirically show the effectiveness of our framework at capturing characteristics of real-world carousels by addressing a large-scale playlist recommendation task on a global music streaming mobile app. Along with this paper, we publicly release industrial data from our experiments, as well as an open-source environment to simulate comparable carousel personalization learning problems.

Alright, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about Carousel Personalization in Music Streaming Apps using Contextual Bandits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the title mentions &#34;Carousel Personalization&#34; and &#34;Contextual Bandits.&#34; So, I know that contextual bandits are a type of algorithm used for making decisions under uncertainty, often in recommendation systems. That leads me to think about algorithms, so maybe categories like Contextual Bandits and Multi-Armed Bandits would be relevant.

The abstract talks about music streaming platforms using swipeable carousels for recommendations. This makes me think of the domain as being related to Music Streaming or Media Services. The problem here is personalizing content, which ties into Personalization in recommendation systems. So, categories like Recommendation Systems and Personalization make sense.

They mention that it&#39;s a challenging task because there are many items (albums, artists, playlists) and varying user preferences. This suggests issues with scalability and handling a large number of options, so Scalability could be another category.

The framework they developed is for carousel personalization, which involves selecting the right items to display. This seems like it&#39;s about Content Selection or maybe Visualizations since carousels are a visual way to present recommendations.

They empirically tested their framework on a playlist recommendation task in a real-world mobile app. That indicates that there are real-world applications and perhaps A/B Testing was involved, as they might have compared different approaches. So categories like Real-World Applications and A/B Testing could apply.

The article also mentions releasing industrial data and an open-source environment for others to simulate similar problems. This points towards Open Source Tools because they&#39;re providing accessible resources for the community. Additionally, since it&#39;s about sharing data and tools, Data Sharing is another category that fits.

They address a large-scale playlist recommendation task, which ties into scalability again but also relates to specific aspects of recommendations like playlist creation or handling diverse content. So maybe something like Large-Scale Recommendations or Playlist Recommendation?

Looking at the guidelines, I need at least 8-12 categories. Let me list what I have so far:

1. Contextual Bandits
2. Multi-Armed Bandits (since contextual is a type of multi-armed)
3. Recommendation Systems
4. Personalization
5. Scalability
6. Carousel Design/Content Selection
7. Music Streaming/Media Services
8. Real-World Applications
9. A/B Testing
10. Open Source Tools
11. Data Sharing

I think that&#39;s 11 categories, which is within the required range. I should make sure each category accurately reflects the content and aligns with user interests. For example, users might be looking for articles on recommendation systems or specific algorithms like bandits, so those are key. Also, since it&#39;s about personalization in music streaming, that&#39;s a popular domain area.

I should double-check if any categories overlap or can be merged. For instance, Carousel Design and Content Selection could potentially be the same, but I&#39;ll keep them separate for clarity. Similarly, Contextual Bandits is specific enough, so Multi-Armed Bandits as a broader category makes sense.

Another consideration is whether there are aspects like Evaluation Metrics mentioned in the abstract. They talk about effectiveness, which relates to evaluation, so maybe Beyond Accuracy or Evaluation could be added. But since it&#39;s not explicitly detailed, I&#39;ll stick with what&#39;s given.

Also, they mention delayed batch feedback, but that might be too specific for a category name. Maybe just leave it under Contextual Bandits as part of the algorithm description.

Lastly, considering user-centric design, these categories should help users find the article whether they&#39;re interested in algorithms, recommendation systems, music streaming, personalization techniques, or real-world applications.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, I need to categorize the research article titled &#34;Carousel Personalization in Music Streaming Apps with Contextual Bandits.&#34; Let&#39;s start by reading the abstract carefully.

The paper talks about using swipeable carousels in music streaming services to recommend personalized content. The main challenge is selecting relevant items given the vast number and diverse user preferences. They model this as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem with multiple plays, stochastic arm display, and delayed batch feedback. They tested their framework on a large-scale playlist recommendation task using real-world data from a music app and also released open-source tools.

So, first, I should identify the core themes. The primary area here is recommendation systems, specifically within music streaming apps. The algorithm used is contextual bandits, which falls under multi-armed bandits in the family of algorithms. 

The domain is clearly music streaming, so that&#39;s a specific category. They address carousel personalization, which is a particular aspect of the recommendation space, and since they mention multiple plays and delayed feedback, these are aspects of evaluation.

Additionally, the paper discusses real-world applications like A/B testing (though not explicitly stated, it&#39;s implied by the experiments) and open-source tools for others to simulate similar problems. They also emphasize scalability given the large-scale experiment.

So putting this together, the categories would include:

- **Contextual Bandits**: As the specific algorithm used.
- **Multi-Armed Bandits**: Broader category since contextual is a subset.
- **Music Streaming**: The domain of application.
- **Carousel Personalization**: Specific aspect of recommendation.
- **Recommendation Systems**: General area.
- **Scalability**: Due to handling large-scale data.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Mentioned through effectiveness and feedback mechanisms.
- **A/B Testing**: Implied by the experiments conducted.
- **Real World Applications**: Since they used industrial data.
- **Open Source Tools**: They released an open-source environment.

I think these categories cover all relevant aspects without being too granular or overlapping. Each category should be useful and have enough articles if more are added in these areas.
&lt;/think&gt;
