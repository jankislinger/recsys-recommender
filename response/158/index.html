        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Next Basket Recommendation with Neural Networks
Abstract:
One crucial task in recommendation is to predict what a user will buy next given her shopping history. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network to complete this task. The model consists of an embedding layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Firstly, the distributed representations of the user and the items bought before are obtained and used to form a feature vector by the embedding layer. Then the hidden layer transforms the feature vector to another space by a non-linear operator. Finally, the softmax operator is adopted to output the probabilities of next items. We can see that the model elegantly involves both the user’s general interest and the sequential dependencies between items for prediction. Experimental results on two real datasets prove the effectiveness of our model.

Alright, let me try to figure out how to categorize this article about Next Basket Recommendation with Neural Networks.

First, I&#39;ll look at the title: it mentions &#34;Next Basket&#34; which makes me think it&#39;s related to recommendation systems, specifically predicting what a user will buy next. So that&#39;s one category—Recommendation Systems.

The abstract talks about using neural networks, so another obvious category is Neural Networks. It also mentions embedding layers and hidden layers, but maybe I can generalize those into Deep Learning since the model is a neural network.

Looking at the structure of the model: embedding layer, hidden layer with non-linear operators, and softmax output for probabilities. This sounds like it&#39;s processing sequences because it involves user history and sequential dependencies between items. So Sequence Modeling should be another category.

The focus on predicting the next purchase suggests this is about Sequential Recommendations, which is a subset of recommendation systems dealing specifically with order or sequence data.

The model considers both the user&#39;s general interest and the dependencies between items bought before. That implies it&#39;s handling user behavior modeling, so User Behavior Modeling makes sense as another category.

They used two real datasets for experiments, indicating that their work has Real World Applications and isn&#39;t just theoretical. This means A/B Testing or User Surveys might also be relevant if they tested with users, but the abstract doesn&#39;t specify those methods. So I&#39;ll stick with Real World Applications.

The method involves feature vectors from embeddings and transformations in hidden layers, which is part of Feature Engineering because they&#39;re creating features for prediction.

They mention evaluating on real datasets to prove effectiveness, so Evaluation Metrics would be another category since it&#39;s about assessing the model&#39;s performance.

Putting it all together, I need at least 8-12 categories. So far I have: Recommendation Systems, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Sequence Modeling, Sequential Recommendations, User Behavior Modeling, Real World Applications, Feature Engineering, and Evaluation Metrics. That&#39;s nine categories, which fits within the required range.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommendation Systems, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Sequence Modeling, Sequential Recommendations, User Behavior Modeling, Real World Applications, Feature Engineering, Evaluation Metrics</code></pre>
