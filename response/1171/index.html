        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Leveraging LLM generated labels to reduce bad matches in job recommendations
Abstract:
Negative signals are increasingly employed to enhance recommendation quality. However, explicit negative feedback is often sparse and may disproportionately reflect the preferences of more vocal users. Commonly used implicit negative feedback, such as impressions without positive interactions, has the limitation of not accurately capturing usersâ€™ true negative preferences because users mainly pursue information they consider interesting. In this work, we present an approach that leverages fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate matches and generate negative signals at scale while maintaining cost efficiency. We demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation quality by deploying a traditional classifier trained using LLM-generated labels.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on the guidelines provided. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Leveraging LLM generated labels to reduce bad matches in job recommendations.&#34; From that, I can tell it&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically for jobs. They&#39;re using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate labels, which are probably used as negative feedback signals to improve the recommendation quality.

Looking at the abstract: The article discusses how negative signals are used to enhance recommendation quality but points out issues with explicit and implicit negative feedback. Explicit is sparse, and implicit might not capture true preferences because users pursue interesting info. They propose using fine-tuned LLMs to generate negative signals efficiently and show that a traditional classifier trained on these labels improves recommendations.

So, the key elements here are:
1. Recommendation systems (obviously)
2. Job recommendations as the specific domain
3. Use of LLMs for generating labels/negative feedback
4. Negative feedback mechanisms in recommendation
5. Fine-tuning models for better performance
6. Cost efficiency and scalability in applying these methods

Now, mapping this to possible categories:

- **Recommendation Systems**: The primary category.
- **Job Recommendations**: Specific domain within recommendations.
- **Negative Feedback**: As the article focuses on enhancing with negative signals.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Since they are central to generating labels.
- **Implicit Feedback**: Even though it&#39;s a limitation, it&#39;s still part of the context.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: They fine-tune LLMs for their task.
- **Scalability/Cost Efficiency**: The approach is designed to be efficient at scale.

I think these are solid categories. Maybe also consider if there are aspects like user behavior or evaluation metrics, but the abstract doesn&#39;t explicitly mention specific evaluation methods beyond demonstrating improvement in recommendation quality. So perhaps sticking with what&#39;s clearly mentioned makes more sense for accuracy.

Wait, another thought: The article is about improving recommendation quality by using LLMs to generate negative labels. Could &#34;Label Generation&#34; be a category? It might fit under aspects of data processing or model training. Also, maybe something like &#34;Machine Learning Applications&#34; since they&#39;re applying ML techniques in recommendations.

But the guidelines suggest categories should be clear and user-friendly, so perhaps combining some ideas:

- **Recommendation Systems**
- **Job Recommendations**
- **Negative Feedback Mechanisms**
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- **Implicit Feedback Analysis**
- **Model Fine-Tuning**
- **Scalability in ML Applications**

I think that covers the main points without being too granular. Let me see if I can find more relevant categories:

- They mention A/B testing or real-world applications? The abstract doesn&#39;t specify, so maybe not.
- Evaluation aspects: They talk about improvements but don&#39;t list specific metrics beyond quality.

So sticking to what&#39;s clear: recommendation systems, job domain, negative feedback, LLMs, implicit feedback issues, model tuning, and scalability.

I should ensure that each category is distinct and relevant. For example, &#34;Negative Feedback&#34; is a separate aspect from the general recommendation system. Also, &#34;Implicit Feedback&#34; refers to how data is collected, which is different from explicit user input.

Putting it all together, I think these categories accurately represent the article&#39;s content without overlapping too much.
&lt;/think&gt;
