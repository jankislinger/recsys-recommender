Title: Combining Dynamic A/B Experimentation and Recommender Systems in MOOCs
Abstract:
We consider how dynamic A/B experiments — used to discover and deploy policies for personalizing items — can be interpreted from the perspective of a recommendation problem, where no prior data is available. We present an illustrative data set we collected, to evaluate algorithms for recommending emails (that vary along dimensions like subject lines) that will maximize response rate, from different subgroups of online learners. This problem is formalized as a contextual bandit, and do an offline regret comparison of how standard bandit algorithms would perform in optimizing response rate. We report a system that provides an API for real–time data exchange and recommendation policy updates from algorithms from external machine learning researchers, and compare our best-performing offline algorithm — Thompson Sampling — against a randomized policy.

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task step by step. The goal is to assign the given research article to multiple relevant categories based on its content. I&#39;ll start by carefully reading through the title and abstract to understand the core themes and topics covered in the article.

The title is &#34;Combining Dynamic A/AB Experimentation and Recommender Systems in MOOCs.&#34; This immediately tells me that the article deals with two main areas: dynamic A/B testing and recommender systems, specifically within the context of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). 

Looking at the abstract, it explains how dynamic A/B experiments are used for personalizing items without prior data. It mentions an illustrative dataset collected to evaluate algorithms for recommending emails that maximize response rates among different subgroups of online learners. The problem is framed as a contextual bandit, and they perform an offline regret analysis comparing standard bandit algorithms. They also discuss a system with an API for real-time data exchange and recommendation updates from external machine learning researchers. The best-performing algorithm found was Thompson Sampling, which was compared against a randomized policy.

From this, I can identify several key themes and concepts:

1. **Dynamic A/B Testing**: This is central to the article as it&#39;s used for experimentation in recommendation systems.
2. **Recommender Systems**: The focus is on how recommendations are made and optimized within MOOCs.
3. **MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses)**: The specific domain where these experiments are conducted.
4. **Contextual Bandit Algorithms**: This is the method used to formalize the recommendation problem.
5. **Offline Regret Analysis**: A technique used to evaluate algorithm performance without real-time data.
6. **Thompson Sampling**: One of the algorithms tested and found to be effective.
7. **Personalization**: The goal of using these experiments is to personalize recommendations for different learner subgroups.
8. **Email Recommendations**: The specific application within MOOCs, targeting email subject lines and content.
9. **Machine Learning API**: The system&#39;s architecture allowing real-time data exchange and policy updates.

Now, considering the guidelines, each article should be assigned 8-12 categories that are clear, descriptive, and user-friendly. I need to map these identified themes into appropriate categories without overlapping too much but ensuring a broad coverage for discoverability.

Potential categories based on the identified themes:

- **Dynamic A/B Testing**: Directly from the title.
- **Recommender Systems**: Core focus of the study.
- **Education (specifically MOOCs)**: The domain where the research is applied.
- **Contextual Bandit Algorithms**: The method used for recommendations.
- **Offline Regret Analysis**: Technique for evaluating algorithms.
- **Thompson Sampling**: A specific algorithm discussed.
- **Personalization in Recommendations**: Goal of the experiments.
- **Email Recommendations**: Specific application within education.
- **Machine Learning API**: System architecture aspect.

I should ensure that these categories are clear and cover all relevant aspects without redundancy. Additionally, I need to check if there&#39;s a need for broader or more specific categories. For example, &#34;Machine Learning API&#34; is quite specific, but it&#39;s directly related to the system&#39;s functionality described in the abstract.

Another consideration is whether any of these categories might be too niche or not widely searched by users. However, since the article combines A/B testing with recommendation systems in education, which are specific yet relevant fields, these categories should serve well for discoverability and navigation purposes.

I also need to ensure that each category is distinct enough but still allows articles to be grouped meaningfully. For instance, &#34;Recommender Systems&#34; is a broad category that can encompass various applications, while &#34;Email Recommendations&#34; is more specific.

Finally, I&#39;ll review the list to make sure it meets the required number of categories (8-12) and adheres to the user-centric design by using clear labels that accurately reflect the content. It&#39;s important that these categories will help users easily find related articles based on their interests in areas like A/B testing, recommendation systems, or educational technology.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. Let&#39;s go through it step by step.

First, the title mentions &#34;Dynamic A/B Experimentation&#34; and &#34;Recommender Systems in MOOCs.&#34; So MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are the domain here, which tells me that Domain of the Problem is Education.

The abstract talks about using dynamic A/B experiments for personalizing items. That falls under Real-World Applications since it&#39;s about deploying policies and testing them in a real setting.

They also mention that this is framed as a contextual bandit problem. Contextual Bandits is one of the family of algorithms, so I&#39;ll include that category.

The article involves recommending emails with varying subject lines to maximize response rates. This specific use case points towards A/B Testing because they&#39;re testing different email variants.

Looking deeper, they evaluate algorithms using an illustrative dataset and compare offline regret for bandit algorithms. The evaluation aspect here is about the performance of these algorithms, so Evaluation Methods is relevant.

They also mention Thompson Sampling as their best-performing algorithm, which clearly ties into that specific family member under Algorithm Family.

The system provides a real-time API for data exchange and policy updates, indicating that Real-World Applications are a key part of this study.

Lastly, since the research applies to online learners in MOOCs, the context is within Education. 

So putting it all together, I&#39;ll list these categories: MOOCs, A/B Testing, Contextual Bandits, Algorithm Family (Thompson Sampling), Evaluation Methods, Real-World Applications, and Domain of the Problem (Education). That should cover all relevant aspects of the article.
&lt;/think&gt;
