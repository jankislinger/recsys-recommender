        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Cascading Hybrid Bandits: Online Learning to Rank for Relevance and Diversity
Abstract:
Relevance ranking and result diversification are two core areas in modern recommender systems. Relevance ranking aims at building a ranked list sorted in decreasing order of item relevance, while result diversification focuses on generating a ranked list of items that covers a broad range of topics. In this paper, we study an online learning setting that aims to recommend a ranked list with K items that maximizes the ranking utility, i.e., a list whose items are relevant and whose topics are diverse. We formulate it as the cascade hybrid bandits (CHB) problem. CHB assumes the cascading user behavior, where a user browses the displayed list from top to bottom, clicks the first attractive item, and stops browsing the rest. We propose a hybrid contextual bandit approach, called, for solving this problem. models item relevance and topical diversity using two independent functions and simultaneously learns those functions from user click feedback. We conduct experiments to evaluate on two real-world recommendation datasets: MovieLens and Yahoo music datasets. Our experimental results show that outperforms the baselines. In addition, we prove theoretical guarantees on the n-step performance demonstrating the soundness of .

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories as per the guidelines provided. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Cascading Hybrid Bandits: Online Learning to Rank for Relevance and Diversity.&#34; So it&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically using a bandit approach for online learning that considers both relevance and diversity in recommendations.

Looking at the abstract, they talk about two core areas: relevance ranking and result diversification. They formulate this as a cascade hybrid bandits (CHB) problem, which involves user behavior where users browse from top to bottom, click on the first attractive item, and stop. The approach uses a hybrid contextual bandit method with two functions for relevance and diversity. They tested it on MovieLens and Yahoo music datasets.

Now, I need to map this into categories based on the provided examples and guidelines.

First, the family of algorithms used is multi-armed bandits, specifically contextual bandits. So that&#39;s one category: Multi-Armed Bandits.

The problem domain is recommendation systems, so that&#39;s another: Recommendation Systems.

They discuss relevance ranking, which is a core aspect in recommendation systems, so Relevance Ranking should be included.

Diversification is also a key focus here, so Result Diversification is another category.

The approach involves online learning to improve recommendations over time, so Online Learning is relevant.

The experiments are conducted on real-world datasets like MovieLens and Yahoo Music, indicating Real-World Applications.

They used user click feedback, which relates to Click Models in recommendation systems.

The study deals with ranked lists in recommendation, so Ranked Lists would be a category.

The evaluation involves aspects beyond just accuracy, considering diversity as well. So Beyond Accuracy is another category.

Since they talk about how users browse and interact (cascading behavior), User Behavior is relevant here.

Lastly, the approach aims to maximize ranking utility, which ties into Optimization in recommendation systems.

Putting it all together, these categories should cover the article&#39;s content accurately without overcrowding any single category.
&lt;/think&gt;
