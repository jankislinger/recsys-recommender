        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: cDLRM: Look Ahead Caching for Scalable Training of Recommendation Models
Abstract:
Deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) are typically composed of two sets of parameters: large embedding tables to handle sparse categorical inputs, and neural networks such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to handle dense non-categorical inputs. Current DLRM training practices keep both these parameters in GPU memory. But as the size of the embedding tables grow, this practice of storing model parameters in GPU memory requires dozens or even hundreds of GPUs. This is an unsustainable trend with severe environmental consequences. Furthermore, such a design forces only a few conglomerates to be the gate keepers of model training. In this work, we propose cDLRM which democratizes recommendation model training by allowing a user to train on a single GPU regardless of the size of embedding tables by storing all embedding tables in CPU memory. A CPU based pre-processor analyzes training batches to prefetch embedding table slices accessed by those batches and caches them in GPU memory just-in-time. An associated caching protocol on the GPU enables efficiently updating the cached embedding table parameters. cDLRM decouples the embedding table size demands from the number of GPUs needed for compute. We first demonstrate that with cDLRM it is possible to train a large recommendation model using a single GPU regardless of model size. We then demonstrate that with its unique caching strategy, cDLRM enables pure data parallel training. We use two publicly available datasets to show that a cDLRM achieves identical model accuracy compared to a baseline trained completely on GPUs, while benefiting from large reduction in GPU demand.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on the given guidelines. The goal is to make sure users can easily find and explore the content through these categories.

First, let&#39;s look at the title: &#34;cDLRM: Look Ahead Caching for Scalable Training of Recommendation Models.&#34; This tells me it&#39;s about a recommendation model (specifically cDLRM) that uses caching techniques to improve scalability during training.

Next, I&#39;ll read through the abstract. The article discusses deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs), which have two main components: large embedding tables and neural networks like MLPs. The problem addressed is the high GPU memory requirement when these parameters are stored in GPU memory, especially as embedding tables grow larger. This can lead to using many GPUs, which isn&#39;t sustainable and limits accessibility.

The proposed solution is cDLRM, which stores embedding tables in CPU memory instead of GPU. A CPU-based pre-processor analyzes training batches and prefetches necessary embedding slices, caching them in GPU just-in-time. There&#39;s a caching protocol for efficient updates. The benefits include using a single GPU regardless of model size, enabling pure data parallel training, and reducing GPU demand without sacrificing accuracy.

Now, mapping this to categories:

1. **Algorithm Family**: Since it&#39;s about recommendation models, DLRM is mentioned, so &#34;DLRM&#34; is relevant.
2. **Recommendation Systems** is definitely a category here.
3. **Caching Strategies** are central as the main contribution.
4. **Scalability** is addressed because they&#39;re making training scalable with fewer GPUs.
5. **Training Optimization** fits since it&#39;s about improving how models are trained.
6. **GPU Utilization** is discussed in terms of reducing GPU usage and requirements.
7. **Memory Management** is involved as they manage memory between CPU and GPU.
8. **Distributed Training** relates to the data parallel training enabled by their approach.
9. **Scalability Analysis** would include evaluating how the model scales with different sizes.
10. **Deep Learning Architectures** since it&#39;s about the structure of DLRMs.

I should also consider if there are more specific categories, but these seem to cover the main points. The categories should be clear and relevant to what the article discusses without being too niche or overlapping too much.
&lt;/think&gt;
