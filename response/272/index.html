        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Recommending Personalised News in Short User Sessions
Abstract:
News organizations employ personalized recommenders to target news articles to specific readers and thus foster engagement. Existing approaches rely on extensive user profiles. However, though often available, authentication is a rare choice of readers consulting news publishers’ websites. This paper proposes an approach for such cases. It provides a basic degree of personalization while complying with the key characteristics of news recommendation including news popularity, recency and the dynamics of reading behavior. We extent existing research on the dynamics of news reading behavior by focusing not only on the progress of reading interests over time but also on their relations. Reading interests are considered in three categories: short, medium and long-term. Combinations of these are evaluated in terms of added value to the recommendation’s performance and ensured news variety. The experiments with 17-month data logs from a German news publisher show that most frequent relations between news reading interests are constant in time but their probabilities change. Also, recommendations based on short-term with long-term interests result in increased accuracy while recommendations based on short-term with medium-term interests yield a higher news variety.

Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about personalized news recommendation systems, especially for users who aren&#39;t logged in. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, looking at the title: &#34;Recommending Personalised News in Short User Sessions.&#34; So it&#39;s about personalization but within short user interactions, which suggests maybe a focus on quick recommendations without extensive user data.

The abstract mentions that existing approaches rely on extensive user profiles, but since authentication is rare, they&#39;re proposing an approach for when users aren&#39;t logged in. This means the system has to work with minimal information. So I should note something about real-time or short-term interactions and maybe cold start problems because without a profile, it&#39;s like starting fresh each time.

They talk about news recommendation characteristics: popularity, recency, and reading behavior dynamics. So categories related to these aspects—popularity, recency, user behavior in news context—are relevant. Also, since they&#39;re focusing on short-term, medium, and long-term interests, that ties into temporal aspects or temporal user modeling.

The experiments use 17-month data logs from a German news publisher, so real-world application is important here. They did A/B testing with actual users, which means it&#39;s applicable in real scenarios—hence categories like real-world applications or A/B testing.

They also mention evaluating performance and ensuring news variety. This points to aspects of recommendation evaluation beyond just accuracy, looking into diversity and other metrics. So category names like beyond accuracy, diversity of recommendations make sense here.

Additionally, the approach uses combinations of different interest durations (short, medium, long-term) which is a specific method in recommendation systems. It also deals with implicit feedback since they&#39;re using user interactions without explicit profiles.

Putting this all together, I need to assign 8-12 categories that cover the article&#39;s focus on personalization in short sessions, news dynamics, real-world application, evaluation beyond accuracy, temporal aspects, and specific recommendation techniques like popularity, recency, and implicit feedback.
&lt;/think&gt;

Personalized News Recommendation, Short User Sessions, Real-Time Interaction, Cold Start Problem, News Popularity, Recency of Content, Reading Behavior Dynamics, Temporal User Modeling, Real-World Applications, A/B Testing, Beyond Accuracy Evaluation, Diversity of Recommendations, Implicit Feedback</code></pre>
