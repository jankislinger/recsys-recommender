        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: The Art of Drafting: A Team-Oriented Hero Recommendation System for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Games
Abstract:
Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games have received increasing popularity recently. In a match of such games, players compete in two teams of five, each controlling an in-game avatars, known as heroes, selected from a roster of more than 100. The selection of heroes, also known as pick or draft, takes place before the match starts and alternates between the two teams until each player has selected one hero. Heroes are designed with different strengths and weaknesses to promote team cooperation in a game. Intuitively, heroes in a strong team should complement each other’s strengths and suppressing those of opponents. Hero drafting is therefore a challenging problem due to the complex hero-to-hero relationships to consider. In this paper, we propose a novel hero recommendation system that suggests heroes to add to an existing team while maximizing the team’s prospect for victory. To that end, we model the drafting between two teams as a combinatorial game and use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for estimating the values of hero combinations. Our empirical evaluation shows that hero teams drafted by our recommendation algorithm have significantly higher win rate against teams constructed by other baseline and state-of-the-art strategies.

Alright, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about a hero recommendation system in MOBA games. Let&#39;s start by breaking down the title and abstract.

The title mentions it&#39;s a team-oriented hero recommendation system for MOBA games, which tells me right away that it&#39;s related to video gaming, specifically multiplayer online battle arenas. The abstract explains that they&#39;re dealing with hero selection or drafting, which is crucial in these games because each hero has unique strengths and weaknesses that affect team dynamics.

The article proposes using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for estimating the values of hero combinations during drafting. That makes me think about algorithms—specifically, reinforcement learning since MCTS is often used there. The system models the drafting as a combinatorial game, so that&#39;s another category to note.

Looking at the problem domain, it&#39;s clearly within video games and more specifically MOBA games. They mention evaluating the win rate of teams, which ties into aspects like team composition and strategy evaluation. There&#39;s also an emphasis on maximizing victory prospects, suggesting elements of competitive strategies.

They&#39;ve conducted empirical evaluations, so real-world applications are involved here. The system is designed to be practical in actual game scenarios, not just theoretical. That points towards A/B testing or live experimentation as part of their methodology.

Since the system suggests heroes based on existing team compositions, it&#39;s handling team recommendations and dynamic adjustments during gameplay. This involves strategic decision-making because each choice affects the overall strategy against opponents.

I should also consider if there are any other relevant aspects like scalability or user interaction, but from what I gather, these might not be primary focuses here. The main points revolve around recommendation algorithms in a gaming context with strategic elements.

Putting it all together, the categories would include areas related to the algorithm (Reinforcement Learning), the problem domain (Video Games, MOBA), aspects of strategy and evaluation (Competitive Strategy, Team Composition, Win Rate Analysis), the method used (Monte Carlo Tree Search), recommendation systems tailored for teams in gaming, real-world application through A/B testing, and strategic decision-making within games.
