Title: Improving Adversarial Robustness for Recommendation Model via Cross-Domain Distributional Adversarial Training
Abstract:
Recommendation models based on deep learning are fragile when facing adversarial examples (AE). Adversarial training (AT) is the existing mainstream method to promote the adversarial robustness of recommendation models. However, these AT methods often have two drawbacks. First, they may be ineffective due to the ubiquitous sparsity of interaction data. Second, point-wise perturbation used by these AT methods leads to suboptimal adversarial robustness, because not all examples are equally susceptible to such perturbations. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel method called Cross-domain Distributional Adversarial Training (CDAT) which utilizes a richer auxiliary domain to improve the adversarial robustness of a sparse target domain. CDAT comprises a Domain adversarial network (Dan) and a Cross-domain adversarial example generative network (Cdan). Dan learns a domain-invariant preference distribution which is obtained by aligning user embeddings from two domains and paves the way to leverage the knowledge from another domain for the target domain. Then, by adversarially perturbing the domain-invariant preference distribution under the guidance of a discriminator, Cdan captures an aggressive and imperceptible AE distribution. In this way, CDAT can transfer distributional adversarial robustness from the auxiliary domain to the target domain. The extensive experiments conducted on real datasets demonstrate the remarkable superiority of the proposed CDAT in improving the adversarial robustness of the sparse domain.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let&#39;s break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: &#34;Improving Adversarial Robustness for Recommendation Model via Cross-Domain Distributional Adversarial Training.&#34; The main focus is on recommendation models and adversarial training. So, I should include categories related to recommendation systems, adversarial robustness, and possibly cross-domain methods.

Now, reading the abstract: It talks about deep learning-based recommendation models being fragile against adversarial examples. They mention existing adversarial training (AT) methods have issues with sparse interaction data and point-wise perturbations leading to suboptimal results. The proposed method is CDAT, which uses a richer auxiliary domain to help the target sparse domain.

From this, I can extract several key points:

1. **Recommendation Systems**: Clearly central to the article.
2. **Adversarial Machine Learning**: Discusses adversarial examples and training methods.
3. **Cross-Domain Methods**: Uses an auxiliary domain to improve the target model.
4. **Deep Learning**: The models are based on deep learning techniques.
5. **Robustness in Recommendations**: Focus on making recommendation models more robust against adversarial attacks.
6. **Distributional Adversarial Training**: A specific type of adversarial training method used here.

I also notice mentions of experimental validation and real datasets, so &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; could be another category. The method involves transferring knowledge between domains, so perhaps &#34;Transfer Learning.&#34; Additionally, the approach deals with sparse data, which is a common issue in recommendation systems, so &#34;Sparse Data Handling&#34; might fit here.

I should ensure each article is assigned to at least 8-12 categories as per guidelines. Let me list out potential categories:

- Recommendation Systems
- Adversarial Machine Learning
- Cross-Domain Methods
- Deep Learning
- Robustness in Recommendations
- Distributional Adversarial Training
- Real-World Applications
- Transfer Learning
- Sparse Data Handling

Wait, that&#39;s nine categories. I should check if any are redundant or could be better represented by another category.

&#34;Cross-Domain Methods&#34; and &#34;Transfer Learning&#34; might overlap a bit since transfer learning often involves cross-domain techniques. However, in this context, the focus is more on adversarial training across domains, so both can remain distinct.

Is there anything else I&#39;m missing? The article also talks about improving model robustness through specific training methods. Maybe categories like &#34;Adversarial Training Techniques&#34; or &#34;Model Robustness.&#34; Let me see if those are already covered.

I think the existing list covers it well. I might have some repetition, but each category adds a slightly different angle. To reach 8-12, maybe add more specific ones:

- Adversarial Attacks in Recommendations
- Cross-Domain Distributional Training

Hmm, that could be too specific, making categories underutilized. Maybe stick to broader terms unless they are standard categories.

Final list after considering all points and ensuring a good spread without being too granular.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article. The title is &#34;Improving Adversarial Robustness for Recommendation Model via Cross-Domain Distributional Adversarial Training.&#34; Hmm, that sounds pretty technical. Let me break it down.

First, the main topic seems to be recommendation models and their robustness against adversarial examples. The abstract mentions deep learning-based recommendation models being fragile against AEs (adversarial examples). They&#39;re talking about using adversarial training (AT) as a method to improve this robustness. But they point out two issues: sparsity of interaction data and the use of point-wise perturbations which aren&#39;t effective enough.

The proposed solution is Cross-Domain Distributional Adversarial Training (CDAT), which uses an auxiliary domain to help the target domain with its adversarial training. They mention using a Domain Adversarial Network (Dan) and a Cross-domain Adversarial Example Generative Network (Cdan). The goal is to create domain-invariant preference distributions by aligning user embeddings from two domains, allowing knowledge transfer.

So, the categories I need to assign should reflect the key aspects of this research. Let me think about the main elements:

1. **Adversarial Robustness**: This is central because they&#39;re dealing with making recommendation models robust against adversarial attacks.
2. **Recommendation Models**: The primary application here is recommendation systems, so that&#39;s a given category.
3. **Cross-Domain Methods**: Since CDAT involves transferring knowledge from an auxiliary domain to the target, cross-domain techniques are definitely relevant.
4. **Distributional Adversarial Training**: The method uses distributional adversarial training, which focuses on the data distribution aspect of attacks.
5. **Deep Learning**: They use deep learning models and networks like Dan and Cdan, so this is another key category.

Are there any other aspects? The abstract also mentions &#34;user embeddings&#34; and &#34;domain-invariant preference distribution,&#34; but I think those might be too specific. Maybe &#34;User Embeddings&#34; could be a category, but it&#39;s quite technical. Alternatively, considering the broader impact, perhaps &#34;Knowledge Transfer&#34; or something like that.

Wait, looking back at the examples provided: categories like &#34;Family of algorithm,&#34; &#34;Domain of the problem,&#34; etc. So I should stick to higher-level categories unless there&#39;s a specific term used in the paper that becomes a common category.

I also see they mention experiments on real datasets, so maybe something related to evaluation metrics or experimental methods? But the main focus is on improving robustness through cross-domain methods using deep learning techniques.

So my initial list would be: Adversarial Robustness, Recommendation Models, Cross-Domain Methods, Distributional Adversarial Training, and Deep Learning. That&#39;s five categories, but I need to assign at least 8-12. Hmm, maybe I can think of more.

Looking again, the method involves a Domain Adversarial Network (Dan) which is part of deep learning architectures, so perhaps &#34;Domain Adaptation&#34; or &#34;Adversarial Networks.&#34; Also, since they&#39;re talking about recommendation systems, aspects like user behavior might be involved, but that&#39;s getting too specific.

Another angle: The problem deals with sparsity in interaction data. Maybe &#34;Data Sparsity&#34; could be a category? Or considering the aspect of improving robustness, &#34;Security&#34; or &#34;Robustness&#34; as broader categories?

Wait, let me make sure I don&#39;t miss any key terms. They talk about perturbations and adversarial examples, so that ties back to Adversarial Machine Learning. Also, the fact that they&#39;re using distributional attacks suggests a focus on attack strategies beyond point-wise perturbations.

So maybe adding &#34;Adversarial Machine Learning&#34; as another category. That&#39;s seven now. Are there more? Let me think about the problem domain: recommendation systems. Maybe &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; is too broad, but perhaps they have subcategories like Collaborative Filtering or something else? The paper doesn&#39;t specify a particular family of algorithms beyond deep learning and adversarial methods.

Alternatively, considering that CDAT uses cross-domain techniques to improve robustness, maybe categories around data augmentation or transfer learning could apply. But I&#39;m not sure if those are directly relevant here.

Another thought: Since the method involves creating adversarial examples in a distributional manner, perhaps &#34;Distributional Robustness&#34; is a category? That might be more specific than needed, but it&#39;s accurate.

So to reach 8 categories, adding Distributional Robustness. Now I have:

1. Adversarial Robustness
2. Recommendation Models
3. Cross-Domain Methods
4. Distributional Adversarial Training
5. Deep Learning
6. Domain Adaptation
7. Adversarial Machine Learning
8. Distributional Robustness

Wait, that&#39;s eight. But let me check if some of these overlap or can be better categorized.

&#34;Domain Adaptation&#34; is similar to &#34;Cross-Domain Methods,&#34; so perhaps it&#39;s redundant. Maybe instead of &#34;Distributional Robustness,&#34; I should use something more general like &#34;Robustness.&#34;

Alternatively, considering the networks they used (Dan and Cdan), which are part of adversarial training, maybe &#34;Adversarial Networks&#34; is a better fit.

So revising:

1. Adversarial Robustness
2. Recommendation Models
3. Cross-Domain Methods
4. Distributional Adversarial Training
5. Deep Learning
6. Adversarial Machine Learning
7. Domain Adaptation
8. Adversarial Networks

That seems better, but I&#39;m not sure if &#34;Domain Adaptation&#34; is necessary since it&#39;s more about cross-domain.

Alternatively, maybe &#34;Transfer Learning&#34; could be a category, as they transfer knowledge from one domain to another. So replacing &#34;Domain Adaptation&#34; with &#34;Transfer Learning.&#34;

Now the categories are:

1. Adversarial Robustness
2. Recommendation Models
3. Cross-Domain Methods
4. Distributional Adversarial Training
5. Deep Learning
6. Adversarial Machine Learning
7. Transfer Learning
8. Adversarial Networks

That seems comprehensive, covering both the specific techniques and broader areas.

Wait, another thought: The paper might also touch on aspects of model generalization or maybe even privacy, but I don&#39;t see that mentioned explicitly. So perhaps it&#39;s best to stick with what&#39;s directly discussed.

I think this list covers all the key points without overcomplicating things.
&lt;/think&gt;

**Categories Assigned:**

1. **Adversarial Robustness**: Central focus on making recommendation models resistant to adversarial attacks.
2. **Recommendation Models**: The primary application in the research.
3. **Cross-Domain Methods**: Utilizing knowledge from auxiliary domains to improve target domain performance.
4. **Distributional Adversarial Training**: Focuses on training methods that consider data distributions for robustness.
5. **Deep Learning**: Use of deep neural networks like Dan and Cdan.
6. **Adversarial Machine Learning**: Broader context of techniques against adversarial attacks.
7. **Transfer Learning**: The process of transferring knowledge from one domain to another.
8. **Adversarial Networks**: Specific networks used in the method, focusing on adversarial training.

These categories encapsulate the core aspects and methodologies discussed in the research paper.</code></pre>
