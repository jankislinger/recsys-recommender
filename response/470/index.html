        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Ghosting: Contextualized Inline Query Completion in Large Scale Retail Search
Abstract:
Query auto-completion presents a ranked list of queries as suggestions for a user-entered prefix. Ghosting is the process of auto-completing a search recommendation by highlighting the suggested text inline within the search box. We propose the use of a behavior-based recommendation model along with customer search context to ghost on high-confidence queries. We tested ghosting on a retail production system, on over 140 million search sessions. We found that session-context based ghosting significantly increased the acceptance of offered suggestions by 6.18%, reduced misspellings among searches by 4.42%, and improved net sales by 0.14%.

Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about Ghosting in retail search. The title mentions it&#39;s about contextualized inline query completion, so that gives me a hint towards the domain being Retail or E-commerce. 

Looking at the abstract, they talk about query auto-completion and highlighting suggestions inline within the search box—that sounds like Search Systems. They used a behavior-based recommendation model, which makes me think of Recommendation Systems as another category.

They tested this on a retail production system with 140 million sessions, so that&#39;s definitely a Real-World Application. The results include increased suggestion acceptance and reduced misspellings, showing improvements in User Experience.

The approach involved using customer search context, so Context-Aware is relevant here. They mention it&#39;s for large-scale systems, which points to Large-Scale Systems. Since they measured the impact on sales, that ties into Sales Optimization.

The method uses a behavior-based model and considers session contexts, so Behavioral Analysis fits as well. Also, their study involved A/B testing in production, indicating User Behavior Analysis.

They also mention improving net sales, which is part of Business Impact. The system scales to handle millions of sessions efficiently, so Scalability is another category.

Putting it all together, I think the categories should cover the domain (Retail, E-commerce), the technology used (Search Systems, Recommendation Systems), application aspects (Real-World Application, A/B Test, User Survey—though survey isn&#39;t mentioned here but maybe others could include it?), and other relevant areas like Context-Aware, Large-Scale Systems, Behavioral Analysis, Sales Optimization, User Experience, Business Impact, and Scalability.

I need to ensure each category is clear and useful for navigation. Some categories might overlap or be too broad, so I&#39;ll pick the most precise ones that best fit the article&#39;s content.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Ghosting: Contextualized Inline Query Completion in Large Scale Retail Search.&#34; Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;ghosting&#34; which refers to inline query completion within a search box. It&#39;s about suggesting queries as users type, but highlighting them inline rather than showing a list. The article proposes using a behavior-based recommendation model along with customer context to improve these suggestions. They tested this on a retail system with over 140 million sessions and saw positive results like increased acceptance of suggestions, reduced misspellings, and improved sales.

Now, looking at the categories I need to assign:

First, &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; makes sense because it&#39;s about suggesting queries based on user behavior. Next, &#34;Query Completion&#34; is directly related since the article discusses auto-completion techniques. 

The study deals with a retail setting, so &#34;E-commerce&#34; is another relevant category. The model they use relies on customer context and behavior, which falls under &#34;Behavior-Based Models.&#34; 

They mention handling large-scale systems, so &#34;Scalability&#34; is important here. The implementation was done in production, indicating it&#39;s applied in real-world scenarios, hence &#34;Real-World Applications.&#34;

The evaluation metrics include acceptance rate and sales impact, which relate to user interaction, so &#34;User Interaction&#34; fits. Lastly, since the study focuses on improving the system based on context, &#34;Context-Aware Systems&#34; is appropriate.

I should ensure each category is clear and relevant without being too specific or broad. Each of these categories should help users find related content easily.
&lt;/think&gt;
