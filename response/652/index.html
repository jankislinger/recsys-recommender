Title: Local Factor Models for Large-Scale Inductive Recommendation
Abstract:
In many domains, user preferences are similar locally within like-minded subgroups of users, but typically differ globally between those subgroups. Local recommendation models were shown to substantially improve top-K recommendation performance in such settings. However, existing local models do not scale to large-scale datasets with an increasing number of subgroups and do not support inductive recommendations for users not appearing in the training set. Key reasons for this are that subgroup detection and recommendation get implemented as separate steps in the model or that local models are explicitly instantiated for each subgroup. In this paper, we propose an End-to-end Local Factor Model (Elfm) which overcomes these limitations by combining both steps and incorporating local structures through an inductive bias. Our model can be optimized end-to-end and supports incremental inference, does not require a full separate model for each subgroup, and has overall small memory and computational costs for incorporating local structures. Empirical results show that our method substantially improves recommendation performance on large-scale datasets with millions of users and items with considerably smaller model size. Our user study also shows that our approach produces coherent item subgroups which could aid in the generation of explainable recommendations.

Alright, let me try to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. The title is &#34;Local Factor Models for Large-Scale Inductive Recommendation,&#34; so right away I can see it&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically focusing on local models and large-scale applications.

Looking at the abstract, it mentions that user preferences are similar within subgroups but differ globally. This suggests a focus on subgroup-based recommendations or community detection in recommendations. The paper talks about improving top-K performance, which relates to recommendation quality metrics.

They mention that existing models don&#39;t scale well with many subgroups and don&#39;t handle inductive recommendations for new users. So the problem here is scalability and handling cold start issues, maybe? Or perhaps it&#39;s more about generalization in recommendation systems.

The proposed solution is an End-to-End Local Factor Model (Elfm) which combines subgroup detection and recommendation steps. This indicates the use of factor models as a family of algorithms. The model supports incremental inference and has low memory and computational costs, pointing towards efficiency and scalability aspects.

Empirical results show improved performance on large datasets with millions of users and items, suggesting practical applications in real-world systems. They also mention a user study showing coherent item subgroups, which ties into explainability and interpretability of recommendations.

So putting this all together, the relevant categories would include recommendation algorithms focusing on factor models and local methods. The domain is clearly recommendation systems with an emphasis on large-scale scenarios. It addresses challenges like cold start and scalability, uses evaluation metrics related to top-K performance, includes real-world applications and user studies for validation, and touches on explainability.

I should make sure each category is clear and covers both the methodological aspects (like factor models, subgroup detection) and application areas (large-scale recommendations). I also need to consider any specific recommendation challenges they tackle, like inductive learning or cold start, which aren&#39;t explicitly mentioned but are related to handling new users.

Additionally, the paper&#39;s user study aspect falls under real-world applications, so categories like A/B testing or user surveys might apply here. However, since it&#39;s a user study evaluating subgroup coherence and explainability, maybe &#34;Explainable Recommendations&#34; is more fitting than traditional application methods.

I think I&#39;ve covered all bases now. The categories should reflect both the technical approach (local factor models), the problem domain (recommendation systems, large-scale), evaluation aspects (top-K performance, scalability), and user-centric elements like explainability.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me read through them carefully.

The title is &#34;Local Factor Models for Large-Scale Inductive Recommendation.&#34; It mentions local factor models and large-scale datasets, which suggests it&#39;s about recommendation systems at scale.

Looking at the abstract: It talks about user preferences within subgroups and how local models improve top-K recommendations. But existing models don&#39;t scale well with many subgroups or support inductive recommendations for new users. The paper introduces Elfm, an end-to-end model that combines subgroup detection and recommendation, supports incremental inference, and is efficient in terms of memory and computation.

Key points:
- Recommendation systems
- Local factor models
- Scalability (since it deals with large datasets)
- Inductive recommendations (for unseen users)
- Subgroup detection
- Model efficiency (small memory and computational costs)

I should map these to the example categories provided. The user mentioned categories like Family of algorithm, Domain, Specific recommendation aspects, Evaluation aspects, Real-world applications, etc.

Family of algorithms: Factorization is a key part here, so &#34;Factorization&#34; would fit. Since it&#39;s local, maybe &#34;Local Models.&#34;

Domain: It&#39;s about recommendations, but the dataset size is large, so &#34;Large-Scale Systems.&#34;

Specific recommendation aspects: They&#39;re talking about subgroup-based recommendations, so &#34;Subgroup Recommendations.&#34; Also, inductive recommendations are a specific aspect.

Scalability: The abstract emphasizes scalability, so that&#39;s another category.

Evaluation aspects: The paper mentions empirical results and user studies showing improved performance, explainability. So maybe &#34;Explainability&#34; is relevant since the subgroups aid in coherent explanations.

Efficiency: They talk about small model size and computational efficiency, so &#34;Computational Efficiency.&#34;

Real-world applications: It might have applications in various domains like e-commerce or media, but the abstract doesn&#39;t specify a particular domain beyond recommendation systems. Maybe &#34;General Applications&#34; if applicable, but perhaps not necessary here.

Other relevant categories: &#34;Inductive Learning,&#34; since it&#39;s about models that can handle new users, and &#34;Incremental Inference,&#34; as the model supports incremental steps.

Wait, in the example categories given by the user, I see things like Scalability, Web Systems, etc. So maybe some of these points align with those.

Let me list potential categories:

1. Factorization
2. Local Models
3. Large-Scale Systems
4. Subgroup Recommendations
5. Inductive Learning
6. Scalability
7. Explainability
8. Computational Efficiency
9. Incremental Inference

I should check if each is appropriate and relevant to the abstract.

- &#34;Factorization&#34; because it&#39;s a factor model.
- &#34;Local Models&#34; as discussed in the paper.
- &#34;Large-Scale Systems&#34; due to handling millions of users/items.
- &#34;Subgroup Recommendations&#34; since they focus on subgroups.
- &#34;Inductive Learning&#34; because it supports new users not in training data.
- &#34;Scalability&#34; is explicitly mentioned.
- &#34;Explainability&#34; because user study shows coherent subgroups aid explanations.
- &#34;Computational Efficiency&#34; due to small model size and low costs.
- &#34;Incremental Inference&#34; as the model allows incremental steps.

I think these cover multiple aspects without overlapping too much. Each category should have enough articles, so I don&#39;t need to create too specific ones unless necessary. This seems balanced.
&lt;/think&gt;

Factorization, Local Models, Large-Scale Systems, Subgroup Recommendations, Inductive Learning, Scalability, Explainability, Computational Efficiency, Incremental Inference</code></pre>
