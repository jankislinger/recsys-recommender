        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: A Multi-view Graph Contrastive Learning Framework for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation
Abstract:
Sequential recommendation methods play an irreplaceable role in recommender systems which can capture the users’ dynamic preferences from the behavior sequences. Despite their success, these works usually suffer from the sparsity problem commonly existed in real applications. Cross-domain sequential recommendation aims to alleviate this problem by introducing relatively richer source-domain data. However, most existing methods capture the users’ preferences independently of each domain, which may neglect the item transition patterns across sequences from different domains, i.e., a user’s interaction in one domain may influence his/her next interaction in other domains. Moreover, the data sparsity problem still exists since some items in the target and source domains are interacted with only a limited number of times. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a generic framework named multi-view graph contrastive learning (MGCL). Specifically, we adopt the contrastive mechanism in an intra-domain item representation view and an inter-domain user preference view. The former is to jointly learn the dynamic sequential information in the user sequence graph and the static collaborative information in the cross-domain global graph, while the latter is to capture the complementary information of the user’s preferences from different domains. Extensive empirical studies on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our MGCL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. The goal is to help users navigate and discover content easily.

First, let&#39;s look at the title: &#34;A Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning Framework for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation.&#34; This tells me it&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically sequential recommendations across different domains using graph-based methods.

The abstract explains that the article addresses sparsity issues in sequential recommendations by using cross-domain data. They propose a framework called MGCL which uses contrastive learning on two views: intra-domain and inter-domain. The method involves user sequence graphs and cross-domain global graphs to capture both dynamic and static information.

So, key elements from the title and abstract are:
1. Sequential recommendation
2. Cross-domain methods
3. Graph-based approach
4. Contrastive learning
5. User preferences and item transitions across domains
6. Addressing data sparsity

Now, I need to map these elements into categories that align with the provided examples. The user wants 8-12 clear, descriptive categories.

Looking at the examples given:
- Family of algorithms: Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits... So here, Graph-based Methods and Contrastive Learning fit.
- Domain aspects: It&#39;s about cross-domain problems, so Cross-Domain.
- Recommendation-specific topics: Sequential Recommendations, Cold Start (though the article doesn&#39;t mention cold start directly).
- Evaluation aspects: Data Sparsity is mentioned as a problem addressed.

Other relevant categories could include:
- Multi-view learning since MGCL uses two views
- User behavior because it deals with user sequences and preferences
- Collaborative filtering as it involves cross-domain data which relates to collaborative aspects

Putting this together, the categories should cover both the methodological approaches (graph-based, contrastive learning) and problem domains (cross-domain sequential recommendation), plus specific aspects like multi-view and user behavior.

I think I&#39;ve covered all necessary areas. Let me list them out.
&lt;/think&gt;

Graph-Based Methods, Sequential Recommendations, Cross-Domain, Contrastive Learning, Multi-View Learning, User Behavior Modeling, Data Sparsity, Collaborative Filtering</code></pre>
