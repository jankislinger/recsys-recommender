        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Balancing relevance and discovery to inspire customers in the IKEA App
Abstract:
IKEA stores are designed to engage and inspire customers as they make their way from the entrance to check-out. To enable a great experience for every individual, our home-furnishing experts strive to provide the best possible input and advice, catering to individual needs and helping customers realise their vision for life at home.
As we move rapidly towards a multi touch point shopping vision with digital at heart, data and machine learning are crucial to 1) enable a consistent journey across, and 2) extend the domain expertise found in stores to our purely digital touch points, like the new IKEA App. A specific example of a digital product where we aim to inspire is our newly launched Inspirational Feed. In the Feed, customers browse their way through ”shoppable” images, in which our products are displayed in purposefully atmospheric settings for a wide range of room types. In this talk, we present our newest algorithmic approach to personalise the Feed based on contextual bandits [2, 3, 4], and highlight some of the technical challenges regarding implementation at scale.
The past decade has led to an explosion in research on recommender systems, often with personalised content as a motivating factor [1]. To identify a suitable class of algorithmic strategies for the Feed, note that: To capture the described trade-off between relevance and discovery, as well as matching data for how customers on average shop with IKEA, contextual bandits with batch learning from logged bandit feedback inspired by [4] have shown especially promising results among numerous other exploitation-exploration strategies. This approach induces a fair amount of exploration and minimizes the risk of showing irrelevant images to the customer based on the principle of counterfactual risk minimisation. In our contextual bandit setup, a bandit session is defined as a user session of the Feed taking place in the App (the home of the Feed). An action is displaying an image, while a reward is generated whenever the user clicks on it. The bandit context consists of previous user behaviour collected from the App, combined with product metadata. Our model takes advantage of embeddings of the input features, similar to [1].
The implementation of the strategy requires us to handle several interesting edge cases, e.g. we are looking into various techniques for increasing exploration as new images are added to our dynamic content catalogue.

Alright, so I need to categorize this research article about IKEA&#39;s app and their inspirational feed using contextual bandits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the title mentions balancing relevance and discovery in the IKEA App, specifically focusing on inspiring customers. The abstract talks about creating a consistent shopping experience across digital touchpoints, which makes me think this is related to e-commerce or retail. So, I&#39;ll note &#34;Retail&#34; as one category.

The article uses contextual bandits for personalization, so that&#39;s a key algorithm here. Contextual Bandits should definitely be a category. It also references other strategies like exploitation and exploration, so maybe &#34;Exploitation-Exploration Strategies&#34; would be another relevant category.

Recommender systems are mentioned, which is a broader area, but since the article is about recommendations within an app, I&#39;ll include that as well. The focus on personalizing content for users ties into &#34;Personalization,&#34; so that&#39;s another one.

They talk about real-world applications like A/B testing and user surveys in their guidelines, and since this was implemented in the IKEA App with a specific feed, &#34;Real World Applications&#34; seems appropriate.

The evaluation aspect here is about the diversity of recommendations and beyond just accuracy. They mention minimizing irrelevant images, which touches on both diversity and going beyond traditional metrics, so I&#39;ll add those categories too.

Implementation challenges are discussed, especially at scale, handling edge cases like new content. So &#34;Implementation Challenges&#34; fits here. Also, since they&#39;re working with embeddings similar to other research, &#34;Embeddings&#34; should be a category.

The domain is clearly about home furnishing and interior design because it&#39;s IKEA, so I&#39;ll include that as well. The technical aspects involve machine learning, particularly in the context of multi-touchpoint shopping experiences, so &#34;Machine Learning&#34; and &#34;Digital Experience&#34; are relevant categories.

Looking at the example workflow, I think I&#39;ve covered the main themes: algorithms, domain, recommendation specifics, evaluation aspects, real applications, implementation issues, and broader tech areas. I should make sure each category is clear and aligns with user interests, like someone looking into retail recommendations or machine learning in apps.
&lt;/think&gt;
