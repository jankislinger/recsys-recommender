        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: gSASRec: Reducing Overconfidence in Sequential Recommendation Trained with Negative Sampling
Abstract:
Large catalogue size is one of the central challenges in training recommendation models: a large number of items makes it infeasible to compute scores for all items during training, forcing models to deploy negative sampling. However, negative sampling increases the proportion of positive interactions in the training data. Therefore models trained with negative sampling tend to overestimate the probabilities of positive interactions — a phenomenon we call overconfidence. While the absolute values of the predicted scores/probabilities are unimportant for ranking retrieved recommendations, overconfident models may fail to estimate nuanced differences in the top-ranked items, resulting in degraded performance. This paper shows that overconfidence explains why the popular SASRec model underperforms when compared to BERT4Rec (contrary to the BERT4Rec authors’ attribution to the bi-directional attention mechanism). We propose a novel Generalised Binary Cross-Entropy Loss function (gBCE) to mitigate overconfidence and theoretically prove that it can mitigate overconfidence. We further propose the gSASRec model, an improvement over SASRec that deploys an increased number of negatives and gBCE loss. We show through detailed experiments on three datasets that gSASRec does not exhibit the overconfidence problem. As a result, gSASRec can outperform BERT4Rec (e.g.\ +9.47\% NDCG on MovieLens-1M), while requiring less training time (e.g.\ -73\% training time on MovieLens-1M). Moreover, in contrast to BERT4Rec, gSASRec is suitable for large datasets that contain more than 1 million items.

Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about gSASRec into the right categories so users can find it easily. Let me read through the title and abstract again.

The title mentions &#34;Reducing Overconfidence in Sequential Recommendation Trained with Negative Sampling.&#34; So, the main topics are sequential recommendations, negative sampling, overconfidence issues, and a proposed solution called gSASRec.

Looking at the abstract: The article talks about large catalogues causing challenges in recommendation models because they can&#39;t compute scores for all items during training. This leads to using negative sampling, which increases positive interactions&#39; proportion and causes models to be overconfident. They propose a new loss function (gBCE) and model (gSASRec) that addresses this overconfidence. The experiments show improved performance compared to BERT4Rec, especially on larger datasets.

Now, considering the categories from the guidelines:

1. **Family of Algorithm**: The paper uses SASRec as a base but improves it with gSASRec. So &#34;Sequential Recommendation&#34; is definitely one. They&#39;re using a loss function approach, so maybe &#34;Loss Function&#34; or something specific like that? Wait, in the examples, they have categories like Matrix Factorization, Encoder, etc., so perhaps &#34;Negative Sampling&#34; and &#34;Cross-Entropy Loss&#34; since they propose gBCE.

2. **Domain of Problem**: It&#39;s about recommendation systems, so &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; is a primary category. The experiments are on datasets like MovieLens, so maybe &#34;Movies&#34; as a specific domain example.

3. **Specific Recommendation Aspect**: They discuss overconfidence in models trained with negative sampling, so &#34;Overconfidence&#34; makes sense. Also, it&#39;s about sequential recommendations, so that ties into user behavior over time.

4. **Evaluation Aspects**: The evaluation includes metrics like NDCG and considers aspects beyond accuracy, such as nuanced differences between top-ranked items. So categories like &#34;Diversity of Recommendations&#34; and &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; could be relevant because they mention evaluating more than just ranking performance.

5. **Real-World Applications**: They talk about A/B testing implications since the model is suitable for large datasets, so &#34;A/ B Test&#34; might apply here as it&#39;s a real-world application aspect.

6. **Scalability and Training Time**: The paper mentions that gSASRec requires less training time and works on larger datasets (e.g., over 1 million items). So categories like &#34;Scalability&#34; and &#34;Training Efficiency&#34; would fit here.

Putting this all together, I need to list these in a way that&#39;s user-friendly. Let me make sure each category is clear and reflects the content accurately. 

I think &#34;Sequential Recommendation&#34; covers the model type. Negative sampling is a key technique they address, so that should be included. They propose a new loss function, which is a significant part of their contribution, hence &#34;Cross-Entropy Loss.&#34; The problem they solve is overconfidence in models, so that&#39;s another category.

The domain is recommendation systems and specifically applies to movies as shown in experiments, so both categories make sense. Evaluation aspects include diversity because they discuss nuanced differences beyond just ranking accuracy, which ties into a broader evaluation criterion. They also improve scalability, making their model suitable for large datasets, hence &#34;Scalability.&#34; The training efficiency is another key point since they mention reduced training time.

Additionally, considering real-world applications, the fact that this could be implemented in A/B tests or user surveys where models are tested against each other adds relevance, so including &#34;A/ B Test&#34; would help users looking for practical implementations.

I should also think if there&#39;s a category about model improvement or optimization since they&#39;re enhancing SASRec. Maybe &#34;Model Improvement&#34; or something similar? But the examples given didn&#39;t have that exact term, so perhaps sticking to the existing categories is safer unless necessary.

Wait, in the guidelines, it says to use any other type of categorization if relevant. So maybe &#34;Algorithm Optimization&#34; could be another category here because they&#39;re optimizing SASRec for overconfidence and scalability. But I&#39;m not sure if this was covered already with &#34;Sequential Recommendation&#34; or &#34;Loss Function.&#34; To keep it concise, perhaps adding &#34;Model Improvement&#34; isn&#39;t necessary since &#34;Cross-Entropy Loss&#34; and &#34;Negative Sampling&#34; might cover the optimization aspects.

So, compiling all these points into the categories:

- Sequential Recommendation (algorithm family)
- Negative Sampling (technique used)
- Cross-Entropy Loss (new loss function proposed)
- Overconfidence (problem addressed)
- Recommendation Systems (domain)
- Movies (specific dataset used, indicating domain applicability)
- Diversity of Recommendations (evaluation aspect beyond ranking)
- Beyond Accuracy (another evaluation aspect)
- Scalability (model suitability for large datasets)
- Training Efficiency (faster training time)

I think these cover the main points. Each category is relevant and should help users find the article when exploring related topics.
&lt;/think&gt;
