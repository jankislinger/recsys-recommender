        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: You Say Factorization Machine, I Say Neural Network – It’s All in the Activation
Abstract:
In recent years, many methods for machine learning on tabular data were introduced that use either factorization machines, neural networks or both. This created a great variety of methods making it non-obvious which method should be used in practice. We begin by extending the previously established theoretical connection between polynomial neural networks and factorization machines (FM) to recently introduced FM techniques. This allows us to propose a single neural-network-based framework that can switch between the deep learning and FM paradigms by a simple change of an activation function. We further show that an activation function exists which can adaptively learn to select the optimal paradigm. Another key element in our framework is its ability to learn high-dimensional embeddings by low-rank factorization. Our framework can handle numeric and categorical data as well as multiclass outputs. Extensive empirical experiments verify our analytical claims.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Okay, so I&#39;m trying to figure out how to categorize this research article based on the title and abstract provided. The title is &#34;You Say Factorization Machine, I Say Neural Network – It’s All in the Activation,&#34; and the abstract talks about methods for machine learning on tabular data using factorization machines (FM), neural networks, or both. The authors extend a theoretical connection between polynomial neural networks and FMs, propose a framework that can switch paradigms via activation functions, show an adaptive function to select the optimal method, and discuss handling high-dimensional embeddings and different types of data.

First, I need to break down the key elements here. The main focus seems to be on machine learning methods for tabular data. They&#39;re comparing and integrating factorization machines with neural networks, which are two different approaches in recommendation systems and predictive modeling. So that gives me some initial categories like Factorization Machines, Neural Networks.

The framework they propose allows switching between deep learning (neural) and FM paradigms just by changing the activation function. That suggests it&#39;s a hybrid approach, so Hybrid Methods could be another category. Also, since they&#39;re dealing with both numeric and categorical data, Data Handling is relevant.

They mention extensive experiments to verify their claims, which falls under Empirical Evaluation. The fact that this is about combining two methods makes Cross-Domain approaches applicable because they’re bridging different algorithm families.

The framework&#39;s ability to handle various outputs like multiclass suggests it&#39;s versatile, so Generalization might be a good category. They also discuss the activation function&#39;s role in selecting the optimal paradigm, which ties into Activation Functions and Model Adaptation or Flexibility.

Looking at the example categories provided earlier, I should think about aspects beyond just algorithms. Since they&#39;re working with tabular data, that&#39;s another category to include. Evaluation is important too because they tested their framework extensively.

I need to make sure each article goes into 8-12 categories. Let me list out what I have so far:

- Factorization Machines
- Neural Networks
- Machine Learning (general)
- Tabular Data
- Hybrid Methods
- Activation Functions
- Empirical Evaluation
- Model Flexibility/Adaptation
- Multiclass Classification
- Generalization

Wait, but in the example output given earlier, some categories were more specific like &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; or aspects of evaluation. Since this article is about combining FMs and NNs for machine learning tasks, perhaps it doesn&#39;t specifically target recommendation systems unless FMs are often used there. But I think the primary focus here is on the methodological integration rather than a specific application domain.

So, maybe instead of &#34;Recommendation Systems,&#34; it&#39;s more about general machine learning techniques. The article also mentions handling high-dimensional embeddings via low-rank factorization, which could be under Representation Learning or Feature Engineering.

Also, since they&#39;re providing a unified framework that can switch between methods based on activation functions, this touches on the concept of Model Architecture and perhaps even Algorithm Design.

Putting it all together, I need to ensure each category is clear, descriptive, and covers both specific and broader aspects. Let me see if I have at least 8 categories:

1. Factorization Machines
2. Neural Networks
3. Machine Learning
4. Tabular Data
5. Hybrid Methods
6. Activation Functions
7. Empirical Evaluation
8. Model Flexibility/Adaptation

That&#39;s eight, but the guidelines suggest aiming for more to enhance discoverability. Let me think of a few more:

9. Generalization (since it works across different data types and outputs)
10. Data Handling (as they handle both numeric and categorical)
11. Algorithm Design
12. Model Architecture

Wait, does &#34;Algorithm Design&#34; add value? Yes, because the article presents a new framework that integrates two algorithms. &#34;Model Architecture&#34; is also relevant as it&#39;s about how the model is structured with different activation functions.

Alternatively, since they&#39;re using low-rank factorization for embeddings, maybe &#34;Feature Engineering&#34; or &#34;Representation Learning&#34; could be added. But I need to stick to user-centric categories that are commonly searched for.

Another angle: their work allows choosing between deep learning and FM, which might relate to &#34;Model Selection,&#34; but that&#39;s a bit abstract. Alternatively, since it&#39;s about combining methods, maybe &#34;Ensemble Methods,&#34; though that&#39;s more about combining models rather than frameworks.

Wait, the example output didn&#39;t include &#34;Ensemble Methods&#34; for this article, so perhaps it&#39;s better to stick with what&#39;s directly mentioned.

So, final categories would be:

Factorization Machines, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Tabular Data, Hybrid Methods, Activation Functions, Empirical Evaluation, Model Flexibility, Generalization, Data Handling, Algorithm Design, Model Architecture.

But I need to make sure the labels are clear and user-friendly. Perhaps &#34;Model Adaptation&#34; instead of flexibility, or &#34;Framework Design&#34; for model architecture. Alternatively, using more specific terms like &#34;Low-Rank Factorization&#34; but that might be too narrow.

Alternatively, considering the example output provided earlier for a different article, which had categories like &#34;Factorization Machines, Neural Networks, Hybrid Methods, Activation Functions, Empirical Evaluation, Model Flexibility, Tabular Data,&#34; maybe I can stick to those and add more specific ones if needed.

I think sticking with 8-12 clear, relevant categories that cover the main aspects without being too narrow is best. So, finalizing on:

Factorization Machines, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Hybrid Methods, Activation Functions, Empirical Evaluation, Model Flexibility, Tabular Data, Generalization, Algorithm Design.

But I need to check if &#34;Algorithm Design&#34; and &#34;Generalization&#34; are necessary or if they can be covered under broader categories. Alternatively, perhaps &#34;Multiclass Classification&#34; is another angle since they handle multiclass outputs, but that&#39;s more specific.

In the end, ensuring a balance between specificity and broadness while covering all aspects mentioned in the abstract.
&lt;/think&gt;

Factorization Machines, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Hybrid Methods, Activation Functions, Empirical Evaluation, Model Flexibility, Tabular Data, Algorithm Design.</code></pre>
