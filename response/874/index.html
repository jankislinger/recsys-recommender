Title: Incentivizing Exploration in Linear Contextual Bandits under Information Gap
Abstract:
Contextual bandit algorithms have been popularly used to address interactive recommendation, where the users are assumed to be cooperative to explore all recommendations from a system. In this paper, we relax this strong assumption and study the problem of incentivized exploration with myopic users, where the users are only interested in recommendations with their currently highest estimated reward. As a result, in order to obtain long-term optimality, the system needs to offer compensation to incentivize the users to take the exploratory recommendations. We consider a new and practically motivated setting where the context features employed by the user are more \emph{informative} than those used by the system: for example, features based on users’ private information are not accessible by the system. We develop an effective solution for incentivized exploration under such an information gap, and prove that the method achieves a sublinear rate in both regret and compensation. We theoretically and empirically analyze the added compensation due to the information gap, compared with the case where the system has access to the same context features as the user does, i.e., without information gap. Moreover, we also provide a compensation lower bound of this problem.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. The goal is to assign at least 8-12 categories that accurately reflect the content and help users navigate easily.

First, looking at the title: &#34;Incentivizing Exploration in Linear Contextual Bandits under Information Gap.&#34; This immediately tells me the main topics are contextual bandits, which fall under reinforcement learning. Also, there&#39;s a focus on exploration, which is a key concept in bandit algorithms. The term &#34;incentivizing&#34; suggests that there&#39;s some mechanism or strategy to encourage user behavior, so maybe something related to incentives or user behavior.

Moving on to the abstract: It discusses how contextual bandit algorithms are used for interactive recommendations but relaxes the assumption that users are cooperative. Instead, it deals with myopic users who only care about their highest estimated reward. The system needs to offer compensation to encourage exploration. There&#39;s also an information gap where user context features are more informative than what the system has access to.

So from this, I can extract several categories:

1. **Contextual Bandits**: This is a specific algorithm family mentioned in both title and abstract.
2. **Reinforcement Learning**: Since bandits are part of RL, this is a broader category that includes the study.
3. **Exploration vs Exploitation**: The core dilemma addressed here.
4. **Incentivizing Exploration**: A strategy used to encourage exploration among users.
5. **User Behavior Modeling**: Understanding how users behave and make choices in recommendation systems.
6. **Interactive Recommendations**: The application area where this research is applied.
7. **Information Gap**: Refers to the discrepancy between user and system context features.
8. **Regret Analysis**: They mention proving a sublinear regret rate, which is a common evaluation metric in bandits.
9. **Compensation Mechanisms**: The method of offering incentives or compensation to users.
10. **Theoretical Analysis**: Since they provide proofs and bounds, this category fits.
11. **Empirical Evaluation**: They also do empirical analysis, so including this makes sense.
12. **Multi-Armed Bandits**: Although it&#39;s a broader term, contextual bandits fall under this.

I should ensure each category is clear and user-friendly, avoiding too niche terms unless they are commonly understood. Also, checking if any of the example categories provided fit here: Family of algorithms (like Matrix Factorization or Encoder), Domain like recommendation systems, Specific aspects like Cold Start, Evaluation aspects like Diversity, Real-world applications like A/B Test.

Wait, in this case, &#34;Interactive Recommendations&#34; is a specific application area, so that aligns with the domain aspect. Also, since they talk about user behavior and incentives, categories like User Behavior Modeling or Incentivizing Exploration are relevant. The theoretical part covers evaluation aspects regarding regret and compensation lower bounds.

I think I&#39;ve covered 12 categories, which meets the guideline of assigning at least 8-12. Each category should help users find related articles easily, whether they&#39;re interested in the algorithm type, application area, user behavior, or evaluation metrics.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through them carefully.

The title is &#34;Incentivizing Exploration in Linear Contextual Bandits under Information Gap.&#34; Hmm, that mentions contextual bandits, which are a type of reinforcement learning algorithm used for sequential decision-making problems where the agent learns a policy that maximizes cumulative reward. The term &#34;linear&#34; suggests it&#39;s using linear models or perhaps linear representations of the problem.

The abstract talks about interactive recommendation systems and how users might not be cooperative in exploring all recommendations. Instead, myopic users are only interested in what gives them the highest estimated reward now. So the system needs to incentivize exploration by offering compensation for taking exploratory recommendations. 

There&#39;s a specific scenario where the user&#39;s context features are more informative than those available to the system. For example, user private info isn&#39;t accessible. The paper addresses this information gap and develops a solution that achieves sublinear regret and compensation.

They also compare scenarios with and without the information gap, analyzing the added compensation theoretically and empirically. Plus, they provide a lower bound for compensation in this problem.

Now, thinking about categorization: 

1. **Algorithm Family**: The article is definitely about Contextual Bandits since that&#39;s mentioned right there. It&#39;s a specific family of algorithms within reinforcement learning.

2. **Domain/Problem**: This seems to be focused on recommendation systems. They talk about users exploring recommendations, which falls under the domain of interactive systems or recommendation systems specifically.

3. **Exploration vs Exploitation**: The core theme is exploration, as they&#39;re trying to incentivize it. So this should be a category.

4. **Incentivized Exploration**: This is a more specific aspect within exploration strategies. They&#39;re not just talking about general exploration but incentivizing users through compensation.

5. **Information Gap**: That&#39;s another key point. The system has an information deficit compared to the user, which affects how it can make recommendations and explore options.

6. **Regret Analysis**: They mention achieving a sublinear regret rate, so this is definitely relevant.

7. **Compensation**: Since they discuss offering compensation as part of their solution, this should be included as a category.

8. **Lower Bounds**: The paper provides a lower bound for compensation, so that&#39;s another relevant category.

9. **Real-World Applications**: They refer to myopic users and real scenarios where user context might not be fully accessible by the system, indicating practical applications in recommendation systems or personalized services.

10. **Theoretical Analysis**: There&#39;s a strong focus on theoretical results with proofs about regret and compensation rates.

I should also check if any other categories apply, but these seem to cover it comprehensively without overlapping too much.
&lt;/think&gt;
