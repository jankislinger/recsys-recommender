Title: CAPRI-FAIR: Integration of Multi-sided Fairness in Contextual POI Recommendation Framework
Abstract:
Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation, a form of context-aware recommendation, takes into account spatio-temporal constraints and contexts like distance, peak business hours, and previous user check-ins. Given the ability of these kinds of systems to influence not just the consumer’s travel experience, but also the POI’s business, it is important to consider fairness from multiple perspectives. Unfortunately, these systems tend to provide less accurate recommendations to inactive users, and less exposure to unpopular POIs. The goal of this paper is to develop a post-filter methodology that incorporates provider and consumer fairness factors into pre-existing recommendation models, to satisfy fairness metrics like item exposure, and performance metrics like precision and distance, making the system more sustainable to both consumers and providers. Experiments have shown that using a linear scoring model for provider fairness in re-scoring recommended items yields the best tradeoff between performance and long-tail exposure, in some cases without a significant decrease in precision. When attempting to address consumer fairness by recommending more popular POIs to inactive users, the result was an increase in precision for only some recommendation models and datasets. Finally, when considering the tradeoff between both parameters, the combinations that reached the Pareto front of consumer and provider fairness, unfortunately, achieved the lowest precision values. We find that the nature of this tradeoff depends heavily on the model and the dataset.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on the guidelines provided. Let me read through the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;CAPRI-FAIR: Integration of Multi-sided Fairness in Contextual POI Recommendation Framework.&#34; From this, I can tell that the paper deals with fairness in recommendations, specifically for Points of Interest (POIs). It mentions a framework called CAPRI-FAIR, which integrates multi-sided fairness.

Looking at the abstract, it discusses POI recommendation systems considering spatio-temporal constraints and contexts like distance, business hours, and user check-ins. The system&#39;s impact on both consumers&#39; experiences and POI businesses highlights the need for fairness from multiple perspectives—provider and consumer. 

The paper addresses issues where inactive users get less accurate recommendations and unpopular POIs have low exposure. They developed a post-filter methodology to incorporate fairness factors into existing models, aiming to balance metrics like item exposure, precision, and distance.

Experiments showed that using a linear scoring model for provider fairness improved long-tail exposure without much loss in precision. However, trying to improve consumer fairness by suggesting popular POIs to inactive users only sometimes increased precision. Balancing both fairness aspects led to lower precision overall, depending on the model and dataset.

Now, let&#39;s think about the categories this should belong to. 

1. **Fairness in Recommendations**: This is central because the paper focuses on integrating multi-sided fairness.
2. **Context-Aware Recommendations**: It deals with POI recommendations considering context like location and time.
3. **Point of Interest (POI) Recommendations**: Directly related to the domain of POIs.
4. **Post-Filter Methodology**: The method used is a post-filter approach on existing models.
5. **Provider Fairness**: Addresses fairness for providers, ensuring their exposure.
6. **Consumer Fairness**: Also considers fairness towards consumers, especially inactive users.
7. **Spatio-Temporal Recommendations**: Because it involves spatial (distance) and temporal (business hours) factors.
8. **Long-Tail Recommendations**: Focuses on improving exposure for less popular POIs.

I should make sure each category is clear and relevant. Let me check if there are other possible categories. The paper mentions experiments with models, but not specific algorithms like matrix factorization or neural networks. It talks about evaluation metrics like precision and exposure, so maybe &#34;Evaluation Metrics&#34; could be another category, but I think the key points are covered above.

I need to assign at least 8-12 categories. Let me see if there&#39;s anything else relevant from the examples given in the guidelines. The paper doesn&#39;t mention specific real-world applications beyond POIs, but it&#39;s about recommendations, so maybe &#34;Context-Aware&#34; is sufficient. It also deals with scalability indirectly through exposure and performance trade-offs.

Wait, scalability isn&#39;t explicitly mentioned, but performance metrics like precision are discussed. Maybe I can include categories related to evaluation aspects. Let me add &#34;Diversity of Recommendations&#34; since they talk about item exposure which relates to diversity. Also, &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; because they consider fairness beyond just precision.

So adding those, the list becomes more comprehensive.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about CAPRI-FAIR, which focuses on integrating multi-sided fairness in a contextual POI recommendation framework. Let me break down how I should approach this.

First, I&#39;ll look at the title and abstract to understand the core themes. The title mentions &#34;multi-sided fairness&#34; and &#34;contextual POI recommendation,&#34; so those are key areas. The abstract elaborates on how POI recommendations consider spatio-temporal factors and addresses issues like inactive users getting less accurate suggestions and unpopular POIs not being exposed enough.

Now, applying the guidelines:

1. **Categorization Accuracy**: I need to make sure each category accurately reflects the content. So, &#34;Fairness&#34; is definitely a primary category. Since it&#39;s about recommendation systems, that should be another one. The specific focus on points of interest suggests &#34;POI Recommendation.&#34;

2. **Category Utility**: Ensuring these categories have enough articles. &#34;Contextual Recommendations&#34; seems appropriate as it&#39;s a common area in recommendation research.

3. **User-Centric Design**: Users looking for fair recommendations or contextual systems would find these categories useful.

4. **Consistency**: The approach should be consistent with how other similar articles are categorized, so terms like &#34;Multi-Sided Fairness&#34; and &#34;Provider Fairness&#34; fit well.

Looking deeper into the abstract, there&#39;s a mention of post-filtering methodology and experiments on different recommendation models and datasets. So categories like &#34;Post-Filtering,&#34; &#34;Recommendation Models,&#34; and &#34;Datasets&#34; make sense. They also discuss performance metrics such as precision and distance, so &#34;Performance Metrics&#34; is relevant.

Additionally, they talk about real-world applications in the context of consumer travel experience and POI businesses, which ties into &#34;Real World Applications.&#34; The focus on inactive users points to &#34;Consumer Fairness,&#34; and the aspect of ensuring exposure for unpopular POIs relates to &#34;Item Exposure.&#34;

Putting it all together, I need at least 8-12 categories. Let me list them out:

- Fairness: Because the paper is about integrating fairness metrics.
- Recommendation Systems: The main area of study.
- Contextual Recommendations: Since they consider context like location and time.
- Multi-Sided Fairness: Addressing both provider and consumer sides.
- Provider Fairness: Ensuring POIs get fair exposure.
- Consumer Fairness: Making sure all users, including inactive ones, are fairly served.
- Performance Metrics: They discuss precision and other metrics.
- Post-Filtering: The methodology used to adjust recommendations.
- POI Recommendation: Specific application area.
- Real World Applications: Impact on actual businesses and user experiences.
- Item Exposure: Ensuring unpopular items aren&#39;t neglected.
- Scalability: Although not explicitly mentioned, it&#39;s a common concern in recommendation systems.

Wait, scalability isn&#39;t directly addressed here. Maybe I should double-check. The abstract focuses more on fairness and performance rather than system scale. Perhaps I can replace &#34;Scalability&#34; with another relevant category like &#34;Spatio-Temporal Context&#34; since they mention distance and peak hours. Alternatively, &#34;Inactive Users&#34; as a specific user group is addressed.

So maybe the final categories are:

Fairness, Recommendation Systems, Contextual Recommendations, Multi-Sided Fairness, Provider Fairness, Consumer Fairness, Performance Metrics, Post-Filtering, POI Recommendation, Real World Applications, Item Exposure, Inactive Users

But &#34;Inactive Users&#34; might be too specific. Alternatively, maybe &#34;User Behavior&#34; as they consider previous check-ins.

Alternatively, to ensure clarity and broader applicability, sticking with the ones I initially thought makes sense.
&lt;/think&gt;

Fairness, Recommendation Systems, Contextual Recommendations, Multi-Sided Fairness, Provider Fairness, Consumer Fairness, Performance Metrics, Post-Filtering, POI Recommendation, Real World Applications, Item Exposure</code></pre>
