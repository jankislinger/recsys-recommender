        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Financial Product Recommendation through Case-based Reasoning and Diversification Techniques
Abstract:
This work proposes a framework for financial product recommendation which combines case-based reasoning with diversification techniques to support wealth managers in recommending personalized investment portfolios. The performance of the framework has been evaluated against 1172 real users, and results show that the yield obtained by recommended portfolios overcomes that of portfolios proposed by human advisors in many experimental settings.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its content. The title is &#34;Financial Product Recommendation through Case- based Reasoning and Diversification Techniques,&#34; and the abstract talks about a framework combining case-based reasoning with diversification techniques for wealth managers recommending personalized investment portfolios. They tested it against 1172 real users, and their results showed that recommended portfolios performed better than those from human advisors.

First, I&#39;ll look at the key elements here. The main focus is on recommendation systems, specifically in the financial domain. So, &#34;Financial Products&#34; should definitely be a category. The article uses case-based reasoning, which is an algorithm family, so &#34;Case-Based Reasoning&#34; is another one. They also mention diversification techniques, so that&#39;s a third category.

Looking at the problem domain, it&#39;s about wealth management and investment portfolios, so I&#39;ll add &#34;Wealth Management.&#34; Since it&#39;s about personalized recommendations, &#34;Personalization&#34; fits too. The evaluation was done with real users, involving A/B testing or user surveys, but in this case, they used a large number of real users, which suggests some form of experimental validation. So maybe &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; since they applied it in a real setting.

The framework&#39;s performance is compared to human advisors, indicating it&#39;s an improvement over existing methods, so that touches on &#34;Improvement Over Existing Methods.&#34; Also, the article likely discusses aspects like how the recommendations are evaluated beyond just accuracy, perhaps looking into user satisfaction or other metrics, which ties into &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; in evaluation.

Putting this all together, I should make sure each category is relevant and covers different angles of the article. Let me see if there are any others. The framework combines multiple techniques, so maybe &#34;Framework Design&#34;? Or perhaps something about portfolio recommendations specifically? But since the user example already includes specific categories like that, maybe it&#39;s not necessary.

Wait, in the examples given earlier, they included things like algorithm families, domains, recommendation specifics, evaluation aspects, and real applications. So I think the ones I have cover those areas. Maybe &#34;Algorithm Design&#34; as another category since they designed a framework using specific algorithms? Or perhaps &#34;Evaluation Metrics,&#34; but the abstract doesn&#39;t specify which metrics beyond performance against human advisors.

Hmm, maybe I can stick with the categories that are explicitly mentioned or clearly implied. So to summarize:

1. Recommendation Systems (main area)
2. Financial Products (domain)
3. Case-Based Reasoning (algorithm family)
4. Diversification Techniques (specific recommendation aspect)
5. Personalization (key feature of recommendations)
6. Real-World Applications (used with real users)
7. Improvement Over Existing Methods (outperforming human advisors)
8. Beyond Accuracy (evaluation beyond just accuracy metrics)

I think that covers the main points without being too redundant or vague. Let me double-check if I missed any key aspects from the abstract.
&lt;/think&gt;
