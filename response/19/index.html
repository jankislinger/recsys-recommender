        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: LinkedIn Skills: Large-Scale Topic Extraction and Inference
Abstract:
“Skills and Expertise” is a data-driven feature on LinkedIn, the world’s largest professional online social network, which allows members to tag themselves with topics representing their areas of expertise. In this work, we present our experiences developing this large-scale topic extraction pipeline, which includes constructing a folksonomy of skills and expertise and implementing an inference and recommender system for skills. We also discuss a consequent set of applications, such as Endorsements, which allows members to tag themselves with topics representing their areas of expertise and for their connections to provide social proof, via an “endorse” action, of that member’s competence in that topic.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article about LinkedIn Skills: Large-SCALE Topic Extraction and Inference. Let&#39;s break down the title and abstract first.

The title mentions &#34;LinkedIn,&#34; which is a professional social network, so maybe Professional Networking could be a category. It talks about large-scale topic extraction, so perhaps something like Text Mining or Natural Language Processing (NLP) would fit here since those techniques are used in extracting topics from text data.

Looking at the abstract, it&#39;s about a feature called &#34;Skills and Expertise&#34; where users can tag themselves with areas of expertise. This sounds like a tagging system, which relates to Folksonomy. So Folksonomy should definitely be one of the categories.

The article discusses building a topic extraction pipeline, which includes constructing the folksonomy and implementing an inference system for skills. Inference systems might relate to recommendation systems, so Recommendation Systems would be another relevant category.

They also mention applications like Endorsements, where users can endorse each other&#39;s skills. This is similar to social proof mechanisms, so Social Proof could be a category here.

Since the feature involves tagging and recommending based on user expertise, this seems related to Expertise Detection. So that should be included as well.

The pipeline they&#39;ve developed handles large-scale data, which suggests that Scalability is an important aspect of their work. Therefore, Scalability should be another category.

The abstract also mentions applications beyond just the feature itself, like Endorsements, so Applications would cover this broader usage context.

Considering the system&#39;s implementation and inference, Real-World Application makes sense as it&#39;s applied in a real platform like LinkedIn.

Looking at evaluation aspects, they discuss how their system works and its applications but don&#39;t explicitly mention metrics beyond functionality. However, since it&#39;s a recommendation system, Evaluation Metrics might be relevant if we consider assessing the effectiveness of recommendations.

Putting this all together, I think the categories should include Folksonomy, Recommendation Systems, Text Mining, Social Proof, Expertise Detection, Large-Scale Data Processing, Applications, Real-World Application, Scalability, and perhaps Evaluation Metrics. 

Wait, but in the example output provided earlier, they had more specific categories like Endorsements as a separate category. Since Endorsements are a specific application within social proof, maybe I should list that as its own category to better capture that aspect.

So finalizing the categories: Folksonomy, Recommendation Systems, Text Mining, Social Proof, Expertise Detection, Large-Scale Data Processing, Applications, Real-World Application, Scalability, Endorsements, and perhaps User Tagging if applicable. But since user tagging is part of Folksonomy, maybe that&#39;s covered.

I should ensure each category is distinct and relevant without overlap where possible. I think the initial list covers it well.
&lt;/think&gt;

Folksonomy, Recommendation Systems, Text Mining, Social Proof, Expertise Detection, Large-Scale Data Processing, Applications, Real-World Application, Scalability, Endorsements</code></pre>
