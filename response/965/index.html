Title: OutRank: Speeding up AutoML-based Model Search for Large Sparse Data sets with Cardinality-aware Feature Ranking
Abstract:
The design of modern recommender systems relies on understanding which parts of the feature space are relevant for solving a given recommendation task. However, real-world data sets in this domain are often characterized by their large size, sparsity, and noise, making it challenging to identify meaningful signals. Feature ranking represents an efficient branch of algorithms that can help address these challenges by identifying the most informative features and facilitating the automated search for more compact and better-performing models (AutoML). We introduce OutRank, a system for versatile feature ranking and data quality-related anomaly detection. OutRank was built with categorical data in mind, utilizing a variant of mutual information that is normalized with regard to the noise produced by features of the same cardinality. We further extend the similarity measure by incorporating information on feature similarity and combined relevance. The proposed approachâ€™s feasibility is demonstrated by speeding up the state-of-the-art AutoML system on a synthetic data set with no performance loss. Furthermore, we considered a real-life click-through-rate prediction data set where it outperformed strong baselines such as random forest-based approaches. The proposed approach enables exploration of up to 300% larger feature spaces compared to AutoML-only approaches, enabling faster search for better models on off-the-shelf hardware.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on the given guidelines. Let&#39;s start by understanding the title and abstract.

The title is &#34;OutRank: Speeding up AutoML-based Model Search for Large Sparse Data sets with Cardinality-aware Feature Ranking.&#34; This tells me that the article discusses a system called OutRank, which is designed to improve AutoML processes, especially when dealing with large and sparse datasets. The key elements here are AutoML, feature ranking, and handling large, sparse data.

Looking at the abstract, it mentions recommender systems relying on understanding relevant parts of the feature space, which points towards recommendation algorithms as a category. Real-world datasets in this context are characterized by size, sparsity, and noise, so those aspects can be categories too. 

The article introduces OutRank for versatile feature ranking and anomaly detection related to data quality. Feature ranking is definitely a specific technique within machine learning, so that&#39;s another category. It also talks about categorical data and using mutual information normalized regarding noise from features of the same cardinality. Cardinality-aware methods and categorical data handling are relevant here.

The system extends similarity measures by incorporating feature similarity and combined relevance, which ties into information theory as a broader field. The authors demonstrate feasibility on synthetic datasets and real-life click-through rate prediction, showing both synthetic data and real-world applications. This also touches on computational efficiency since they mention exploring larger feature spaces faster without performance loss.

They compare OutRank to AutoML-only approaches and strong baselines like random forests, indicating that AutoML is a core part of the system. The performance improvements in model search speed suggest enhanced efficiency in machine learning workflows.

Putting this all together, the categories should include aspects related to recommendation systems, feature ranking techniques, AutoML, handling large and sparse datasets, categorical data, cardinality-aware methods, anomaly detection, information theory, synthetic data usage, real-world applications, computational efficiency, and model search improvements. I need to make sure each category is clear and accurately reflects the content without being too niche or too broad.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I need to categorize this research article based on the given guidelines. Let&#39;s go through it step by step.

First, looking at the title: &#34;OutRank: Speeding up AutoML-based Model Search for Large Sparse Data sets with Cardinality-aware Feature Ranking.&#34; The key terms here are AutoML, feature ranking, large sparse datasets. So categories related to AutoML and feature selection come to mind.

The abstract discusses how OutRank is designed for feature ranking in recommender systems, dealing with large, sparse, noisy data. It mentions improving the efficiency of model search by identifying meaningful features. So, I can think of categories like Feature Selection and Recommender Systems.

They talk about using a variant of mutual information normalized by cardinality, which suggests that the method is tailored for categorical data and considers feature similarity. This makes me add Categorical Data and Mutual Information as categories.

The paper also addresses performance improvements in AutoML systems, specifically speeding up the process without losing accuracy. So, I should include AutoML and Performance Optimization.

Another point is about handling large datasets efficiently, which relates to Scalability. Also, the mention of anomaly detection ties into Anomaly Detection as a category.

Since the dataset examples include click-through-rate prediction, this falls under the domain of Web Systems, so adding that makes sense.

Lastly, the focus on efficient model search and feature ranking is part of Feature Engineering, so that&#39;s another relevant category.

I need to make sure each article goes into at least 8 categories. Let me list them out again to ensure I have enough: AutoML, Recommender Systems, Feature Selection, Scalability, Categorical Data, Mutual Information, Anomaly Detection, Performance Optimization, Web Systems, and Feature Engineering. That&#39;s ten, which meets the requirement.

I should check if these categories are clear and user-friendly. They seem relevant and descriptive. Also, each category is specific enough but broad enough to be useful for navigation.
&lt;/think&gt;
