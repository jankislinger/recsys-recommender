        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Going Beyond Local: Global Graph-Enhanced Personalized News Recommendations
Abstract:
Precisely recommending candidate news articles to users has always been a core challenge for personalized news recommendation systems. Most recent work primarily focuses on using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract semantic information from rich textual data, employing content-based methods derived from locally viewed historical clicked news. However, this approach lacks a global perspective, failing to account for users’ hidden motivations and behaviors beyond semantic information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model called GLORY(Global-LOcal news Recommendation sYstem), which combines global news representations learned from other users with local news representations to enhance personalized recommendation systems. We accomplish this by constructing a Global Clicked News Encoder, which includes a global news graph and employs gated graph neural networks to fuse news representations, thereby enriching clicked news representations. Similarly, we extend this approach to a Global Candidate News Encoder, utilizing a global entity graph and candidate news fusion to enhance candidate news representation. Evaluation results on two public news datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Furthermore, our model offers more diverse recommendations.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about personalized news recommendations using a model called GLORY. The title is &#34;Going Beyond Local: Global Graph-Enhanced Personalized News Recommendations,&#34; and the abstract talks about combining global and local representations using graph neural networks.

First, I&#39;ll read through the example workflow provided. It says to analyze the title and abstract for core themes, map them to existing categories or propose new ones, ensure they fit well, and check consistency with user needs. 

Looking at the title, it mentions personalized news recommendations and global graph-enhanced methods. The abstract explains that most current systems focus on local, content-based approaches using NLP but miss the global perspective. So the core themes are combining global and local information for better recommendations.

The categories from the example include things like family of algorithms (e.g., Matrix Factorization), domain of problem (e.g., News), specific recommendation aspects (e.g.,冷启动/Cold Start), evaluation aspects, real-world applications, etc.

So let&#39;s break down the article:

1. **Algorithm Family**: The paper uses graph neural networks and gated graph neural networks, so those should be included.
2. **Domain**: Clearly news recommendations.
3. **Specific Recommendation Aspects**: It talks about combining global and local representations, which is a specific aspect in recommendation systems.
4. **Evaluation Aspects**: They mention evaluation results showing better performance and more diverse recommendations, so diversity of recommendations is an aspect here.
5. **Real-World Applications**: The abstract mentions that the model offers more diverse recommendations, which could imply real-world application benefits.
6. **Other Categories**: Since they&#39;re combining global and local, it&#39;s about enhancing recommendation systems beyond traditional methods. Also, the method involves user modeling as it considers hidden motivations.

Putting this together:

- Graph Neural Networks (from the algorithm)
- Gated Graph Neural Networks (specific type used)
- News Recommendations (domain)
- Global Representation (as they combine global data)
- Personalized Recommendations (core of recommendation systems)
- User Modeling (since they consider user behaviors and motivations)
- Recommendation Diversity (evaluation aspect)
- Evaluation Results (they provided results showing improvement)

I think that covers the main points. I need to make sure each category is relevant and fits into the user-centric design, ensuring discoverability.
&lt;/think&gt;
