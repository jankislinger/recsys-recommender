        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Darwin &amp; Goliath: A White-Label Recommender-System As-a-Service with Automated Algorithm-Selection
Abstract:
Recommendations-as-a-Service (RaaS) ease the process for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to offer product recommendations to their customers. Current RaaS, however, suffer from a one-size-fits-all concept, i.e. they apply the same recommendation algorithm for all SMEs. We introduce Darwin &amp; Goliath, a RaaS that features multiple recommendation frameworks (Apache Lucene, TensorFlow, ...), and identifies the ideal algorithm for each SME automatically. Darwin &amp; Goliath further offers per-instance algorithm selection and a white label feature that allows SMEs to offer a RaaS under their own brand. Since November 2018, Darwin &amp; Goliath has delivered more than 1m recommendations with a CTR = 0.5%.

Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about Darwin &amp; Goliath, which is a Recommender-System as-a-Service (RaaS). Let me go through the process step by step.

First, looking at the title and abstract, the main focus seems to be on providing SMEs with recommendation solutions. So, &#34;Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises&#34; should definitely be one category.

The article mentions they offer automated algorithm selection, so that&#39;s another key point. They use multiple frameworks like Apache Lucene and TensorFlow, which tells me their approach is framework-agnostic, so &#34;Framework-Agnostic&#34; makes sense as a category.

They provide white-label services, allowing SMEs to brand the RaaS under their own names. So, &#34;White Label&#34; should be included too.

Since this is about recommendations, it&#39;s essential to include &#34;Recommendation Systems.&#34; The system uses machine learning algorithms because they mention TensorFlow, so &#34;Machine Learning&#34; is relevant.

The article talks about automated algorithm selection, which means the system adapts based on different SME needs. That makes me think of &#34;Algorithm Adaptation.&#34;

They deliver a lot of recommendations (over 1 million) with a certain CTR, indicating real-world applications and usage. So categories like &#34;Real World Applications,&#34; &#34;A/B Test&#34; (though not directly mentioned, it&#39;s part of application evaluation), and &#34;User Survey&#34; could be relevant since they might have tested their system with users.

Looking at the problem domain, this is more about e-commerce as SMEs are likely using it for product recommendations. So, &#34;E-Commerce&#34; should be included.

The article mentions scalability because it serves many recommendations efficiently. Thus, &#34;Scalability&#34; is another category.

They also mention per-instance algorithm selection, which implies customization at a granular level. Therefore, &#34;Customization&#34; fits here.

I need to ensure each article is assigned 8-12 categories. Let me count: SMEs, Automated Algorithm Selection, Framework-Agnostic, White Label, Recommendation Systems, Machine Learning, Algorithm Adaptation, Real World Applications, A/B Test, User Survey, E-Commerce, Scalability, Customization. That&#39;s more than 12, so I should pick the most relevant ones.

The key themes are RaaS for SMEs with automated algorithm selection and white-labeling. So I&#39;ll include SMEs, Automated Algorithm Selection, White Label, Framework-Agnostic, Recommendation Systems, Machine Learning, Real World Applications, Scalability, and maybe E-Commerce as the domain.

I think that&#39;s a solid set covering both specific aspects like automated selection and broader categories like recommendation systems and e-commerce. It also includes real-world application elements which are important for user-centric design.
&lt;/think&gt;

Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs), Automated Algorithm Selection, White Label, Framework-Agnostic, Recommendation Systems, Machine Learning, Real World Applications, Scalability</code></pre>
