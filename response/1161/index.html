        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Improving Data Efficiency for Recommenders and LLMs
Abstract:
In recent years, massive transformer-based architectures have driven breakthrough performance in practical applications like autoregressive text-generation (LLMs) and click-prediction (recommenders). A common recipe for success is to train large models on massive web-scale datasets, e.g., modern recommenders are trained on billions of user-item click events, and LLMs are trained on trillions of tokens extracted from the public internet. We are close to hitting the computational and economical limits of scaling up the size of these models, and we expect the next frontier of gains to come from improving the: (i) data quality of the training dataset, and (ii) data efficiency of the extremely expensive training procedure. Inspired by this shift, we present a set of “data-centric” techniques for recommendation and language models that summarizes a dataset into a terse data summary, which is both (i) high-quality, i.e., trains better quality models, and (ii) improves the data-efficiency of the overall training procedure. We propose techniques from two disparate data frameworks: (i) data selection (a.k.a., coreset construction) methods that sample portions of the dataset using grounded heuristics, and(ii) data distillation techniques that generate synthetic examples which are optimized to retain the signals needed for training high-quality models. Overall, this work sheds light on the challenges and opportunities offered by data optimization in web-scale systems, a particularly relevant focus as the recommendation community grapples with the grand challenge of leveraging LLMs.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Alright, I need to categorize this article about improving data efficiency for recommenders and LLMs. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Recommenders&#34; and &#34;LLMs,&#34; so that&#39;s a big clue. The abstract talks about transformer-based architectures used in autoregressive text-generation (like LLMs) and click-prediction (recommenders). So, right off the bat, I can note categories like Recommender Systems and Large Language Models.

The article discusses using large models on massive datasets—billions of user-item clicks for recommenders and trillions of tokens for LLMs. This points to Web-Scale Systems as a category because it&#39;s dealing with very large data and systems.

They mention hitting computational limits when scaling up model size, so the next frontier is improving data quality and efficiency. That suggests categories related to Data Efficiency and Data Quality. The techniques they propose include data selection (coreset construction) and data distillation. So those should be included as well: Data Selection, Coreset Construction, Data Distillation.

The article also talks about synthetic examples optimized for training signals, which ties into Synthetic Data. They’re summarizing datasets into high-quality data summaries to improve model quality and efficiency—so High-Quality Datasets is another category.

Since the techniques are applicable across recommendation and language models, I can include Cross-Domain Applications. The focus on optimization in web-scale systems means Web-Scale Optimization is relevant too.

The abstract mentions leveraging LLMs in recommendations, highlighting a connection between the two fields, so Recommender-LLM Integration makes sense as another category.

Putting it all together, these categories should cover both specific techniques and broader applications, ensuring discoverability for users interested in either recommenders or LLMs.
&lt;/think&gt;
