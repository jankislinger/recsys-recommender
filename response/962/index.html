Title: EasyStudy: Framework for Easy Deployment of User Studies on Recommender Systems
Abstract:
Improvements in the recommender systems (RS) domain are not possible without a thorough way to evaluate and compare newly proposed approaches. User studies represent a viable alternative to online and offline evaluation schemes, but despite their numerous benefits, they are only rarely used. One of the main reasons behind this fact is that preparing a user study from scratch involves a lot of extra work on top of a simple algorithm proposal.  To simplify this task, we propose \textsc{EasyStudy}, a modular framework built on the credo “\textit{Make simple things fast and hard things possible}”. It features ready-to-use datasets, preference elicitation methods, incrementally tuned baseline algorithms, study flow plugins, and evaluation metrics. As a result, a simple study comparing several RS can be deployed with just a few clicks, while more complex study designs can still benefit from a range of reusable components, such as preference elicitation. Overall, \textsc{EasyStudy} dramatically decreases the gap between the laboriousness of offline evaluation vs. user studies and, therefore, may contribute towards the more reliable and insightful user-centric evaluation of next-generation RS.

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about &#34;EasyStudy: Framework for Easy Deployment of User Studies on Recommender Systems.&#34; The goal is to assign it to multiple categories based on its content. Let me read through the abstract again to make sure I understand what it&#39;s about.

The title mentions a framework called EasyStudy, which helps deploy user studies on recommender systems. From the abstract, I gather that the authors are addressing the gap in evaluating recommender systems through user studies instead of just online or offline methods. They mention that user studies aren&#39;t used often because setting them up from scratch is too time-consuming and requires a lot of extra work beyond proposing an algorithm.

The framework they&#39;ve developed has features like ready-to-use datasets, preference elicitation methods, tuned baseline algorithms, study flow plugins, and evaluation metrics. This makes it easier to deploy both simple and complex studies with less effort. Their aim is to bridge the gap between offline evaluations and user studies, making evaluations more reliable and focused on user-centric aspects.

Now, I need to map this into relevant categories. The guidelines suggest considering things like algorithms, domains, specific recommendation aspects, evaluation methods, real-world applications, etc. Let&#39;s break it down step by step.

First, looking at the family of algorithm: The article talks about baseline algorithms that are part of the framework. So maybe &#34;Baseline Algorithms&#34; is a category here.

Next, the domain of the problem: Since this is about recommender systems in general, but specifically focused on user studies and evaluation, perhaps categories like &#34;User-Centric Evaluation,&#34; &#34;Evaluation Methods,&#34; or &#34;User Studies.&#34;

Specific aspects in recommendation space: The framework helps with preference elicitation, which is a specific part of recommendations. So maybe &#34;Preference Elicitation&#34; is another category.

Real-world applications: They mention that the framework can be used to deploy studies in real-world settings, so perhaps &#34;Framework Development,&#34; or more specifically, &#34;User Study Framework.&#34;

Aspects of evaluation beyond accuracy: Since they talk about making evaluations more reliable and user-centric, maybe categories like &#34;Evaluation Metrics&#34; or &#34;Beyond Accuracy Evaluation.&#34;

Other relevant aspects could include &#34;Scalability&#34; because the framework is designed to handle both simple and complex studies efficiently. Also, since it&#39;s modular and aims to simplify tasks, perhaps &#34;Modular Frameworks.&#34;

I should ensure that each article is assigned to at least 8-12 categories. Let me list out possible categories based on the above thoughts:

1. Recommender Systems (main domain)
2. User-Centric Evaluation
3. Evaluation Methods
4. User Studies
5. Preference Elicitation
6. Framework Development
7. Baseline Algorithms
8. Beyond Accuracy Evaluation
9. Scalability
10. Modular Frameworks

I think these cover the main aspects of the article. I should check if there are any other categories that might fit, but this seems comprehensive.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;EasyStudy: Framework for Easy Deployment of User Studies on Recommender Systems.&#34; The abstract talks about how user studies are important but hard to set up, which leads to their underuse in evaluating recommender systems. They&#39;ve created a framework called EasyStudy that simplifies deploying these studies, making it easier for researchers.

Let me start by breaking down the key elements of the title and abstract. The main focus is on user studies and recommender systems evaluation. So, categories related to evaluation methods like user-centric evaluation or evaluation frameworks would be relevant. 

The article mentions that EasyStudy provides ready-to-use datasets and tools, which suggests it&#39;s about improving the efficiency of evaluations. So I should consider categories like Evaluation Frameworks and maybe something specific to Recommender Systems since that&#39;s the domain.

Another point is that the framework aims to bridge the gap between offline evaluation and user studies, making deployment easier. This implies a focus on usability and practical tools, so terms like User-Centric Evaluation or Evaluation Tools might fit here.

The abstract also discusses aspects like preference elicitation methods and evaluation metrics, which are specific components of user studies. Therefore, categories such as Preference Elicitation and Evaluation Metrics would be appropriate.

Additionally, the framework&#39;s modular structure allows for both simple deployments (a few clicks) and more complex designs using reusable components. This suggests it&#39;s about improving efficiency and scalability in evaluations, so maybe a category like Scalability or Efficiency could apply.

Looking at the example categories provided earlier, I should aim for around 8-12 categories. Let me list potential ones:

1. User-Centric Evaluation
2. Recommender Systems Evaluation
3. Evaluation Frameworks
4. Usability in Evaluation
5. Preference Elicitation
6. Evaluation Metrics
7. Modular Frameworks
8. Scalability
9. Efficiency
10. Deployment Tools
11. Offline vs Online Evaluation
12. User Studies

Wait, the user provided examples include things like &#34;Scalability&#34; and &#34;Web Systems,&#34; but in this case, it&#39;s more about evaluation tools for recommender systems. So I think my list covers relevant categories.

I should make sure these are clear and descriptive. For instance, instead of just &#34;Evaluation,&#34; using &#34;User-Centric Evaluation&#34; is more specific to the article&#39;s focus.

Let me double-check if any other aspects were covered. The framework helps in creating both simple and complex study designs, so maybe something like Design Frameworks or Study Designs could be included, but those might overlap with Modular Frameworks.

I think I&#39;ve covered all the necessary points. Now, I&#39;ll compile these into a list of keywords separated by commas.
&lt;/think&gt;

User-Centric Evaluation, Recommender Systems Evaluation, Evaluation Frameworks, Usability in Evaluation, Preference Elicitation, Evaluation Metrics, Modular Frameworks, Scalability, Efficiency, Deployment Tools</code></pre>
