        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Page-wise Recommendations
Abstract:
Recommender systems can mitigate the information overload problem by suggesting users’ personalized items. In real-world recommendations such as e-commerce, a typical interaction between the system and its users is — users are recommended a page of items and provide feedback; and then the system recommends a new page of items. To effectively capture such interaction for recommendations, we need to solve two key problems — (1) how to update recommending strategy according to user’s real-time feedback, and 2) how to generate a page of items with proper display, which pose tremendous challenges to traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we study the problem of page-wise recommendations aiming to address aforementioned two challenges simultaneously. In particular, we propose a principled approach to jointly generate a set of complementary items and the corresponding strategy to display them in a 2-D page; and propose a novel page-wise recommendation framework based on deep reinforcement learning, DeepPage, which can optimize a page of items with proper display based on real-time feedback from users. The experimental results based on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about Deep Reinforcement Learning for Page-wise Recommendations. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: &#34;Deep Reinforcement Learning for Page-wise Recommendations.&#34; So right away, I can note that it involves Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning as techniques. Also, since it&#39;s about recommendations, Recommender Systems is definitely a category.

The abstract mentions that it&#39;s about mitigating information overload by suggesting personalized items. That points to Personalization being another category. They&#39;re looking at real-world applications in e-commerce, so E-commerce should be included too.

They talk about users providing feedback on a page of items and the system updating its strategy based on that. This sounds like Real-time Feedback handling, which is an important aspect of user interaction in recommendation systems. So I&#39;ll add Real-time Feedback as another category.

The problem they&#39;re addressing involves two key challenges: updating the recommendation strategy with real-time feedback and generating a page of items with proper display. The second point about displaying items on a 2D page suggests that Page Display is a relevant category here.

They propose using DeepPage, which is based on deep reinforcement learning. This indicates both Deep Learning (which I already have) and Reinforcement Learning as key methods used in their approach.

The experimental results are based on a real-world e-commerce dataset, so Real-World Applications should be another category since they&#39;re applying their method in a practical setting.

Looking at the problem-solving aspect, they aim to generate complementary items. This ties into Item Generation, which is about how recommendations are created or selected.

They also mention optimizing a page of items based on user feedback, which relates to Optimization techniques within recommendation systems. So that&#39;s another category.

Additionally, considering their approach is in the realm of machine learning, Machine Learning as a broader category makes sense.

I should make sure each article is assigned 8-12 categories without overcrowding any single one. Let me list out what I have so far:

1. Recommender Systems
2. Deep Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning
4. Personalization
5. E-commerce
6. Real-time Feedback
7. Page Display
8. Item Generation
9. Optimization
10. Machine Learning

That&#39;s 10 categories, which fits the guideline of 8-12. I don&#39;t think any category is redundant here, and they all accurately reflect different aspects of the article.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommender Systems, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Personalization, E-commerce, Real-time Feedback, Page Display, Item Generation, Optimization, Machine Learning</code></pre>
