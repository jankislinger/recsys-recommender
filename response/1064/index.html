        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: The Elephant in the Room: Rethinking the Usage of Pre-trained Language Model in Sequential Recommendation
Abstract:
Sequential recommendation (SR) has seen significant advancements with the help of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Some PLM-based SR models directly use PLM to encode user historical behaviorâ€™s text sequences to learn user representations, while there is seldom an in-depth exploration of the capability and suitability of PLM in behavior sequence modeling. In this work, we first conduct extensive model analyses between PLMs and PLM-based SR models, discovering great underutilization and parameter redundancy of PLMs in behavior sequence modeling. Inspired by this, we explore different lightweight usages of PLMs in SR, aiming to maximally stimulate the ability of PLMs for SR while satisfying the efficiency and usability demands of practical systems. We discover that adopting behavior-tuned PLMs for item initializations of conventional ID-based SR models is the most economical framework of PLM-based SR, which would not bring in any additional inference cost but could achieve a dramatic performance boost compared with the original version. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that our simple and universal framework leads to significant improvement compared to classical SR and SOTA PLM-based SR models without additional inference costs.

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about using pre-trained language models in sequential recommendation systems. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;The Elephant in the Room: Rethinking the Usage of Pre-trained Language Model in Sequential Recommendation.&#34; The abstract explains that sequential recommendation (SR) has advanced with PLMs, but there&#39;s not enough exploration into how effective these models are for behavior sequence modeling. They found underutilization and redundancy, so they looked at lightweight ways to use PLMs. Their approach involved tuning PLMs for behaviors and using them in existing SR models without extra costs, which improved performance.

Now, I need to assign categories based on the guidelines. Each article should go into 8-12 categories. Let me break down the key elements:

1. **Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs)**: Clearly a main focus, so that&#39;s one category.
2. **Sequential Recommendation**: The application area in recommendation systems.
3. **Model Analysis**: They analyzed PLMs and their effectiveness in SR.
4. **Behavior Sequence Modeling**: Since they&#39;re looking at user behavior sequences.
5. **Efficiency in Recommendations**: They mention efficiency and avoiding extra costs, so this fits here.
6. **Lightweight Usage of PLMs**: They explored lighter ways to apply PLMs without overcomplicating things.
7. **Parameter Redundancy**: This is about model optimization and reducing unnecessary parameters.
8. **Model Adaptation**: They adapted PLMs for specific tasks in SR.

I might also consider other areas like &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; as a broader category, but I&#39;m limited to the examples given. Let me see if any other aspects fit: they mention extensive experiments across datasets, which relates to evaluation methods, so maybe &#34;Evaluation Methods.&#34; Also, their approach leads to performance improvements, so &#34;Performance Improvement.&#34;

Wait, looking back at the example categories provided earlier, some like &#34;Family of algorithm&#34; could include PLMs as a specific algorithm family. But in my initial list, I already included Pre-trained Language Models.

So compiling these thoughts:

- Pre-trained Language Models
- Sequential Recommendation
- Model Analysis
- Behavior Sequence Modeling
- Efficiency in Recommendations
- Lightweight Usage of PLMs
- Parameter Redundancy
- Model Adaptation

I think that&#39;s eight categories. They cover the main points: the use of PLMs, their application in SR, the analysis done, efficiency concerns, and model adaptation. This should help users find the article if they&#39;re interested in any of these areas.
&lt;/think&gt;
