Title: Rethinking Multi-Interest Learning for Candidate Matching in Recommender Systems
Abstract:
Existing research efforts for multi-interest candidate matching in recommender systems mainly focus on improving model architecture or incorporating additional information, neglecting the importance of training schemes. This work revisits the training framework and uncovers two major problems hindering the expressiveness of learned multi-interest representations. First, the current training objective (i.e., uniformly sampled softmax) fails to effectively train discriminative representations in a multi-interest learning scenario due to the severe increase in easy negative samples. Second, a routing collapse problem is observed where each learned interest may collapse to express information only from a single item, resulting in information loss. To address these issues, we propose the REMI framework, consisting of an Interest-aware Hard Negative mining strategy (IHN) and a Routing Regularization (RR) method. IHN emphasizes interest-aware hard negatives by proposing an ideal sampling distribution and developing a Monte-Carlo strategy for efficient approximation. RR prevents routing collapse by introducing a novel regularization term on the item-to-interest routing matrices. These two components enhance the learned multi-interest representations from both the optimization objective and the composition information. REMI is a general framework that can be readily applied to various existing multi-interest candidate matching methods. Experiments on three real-world datasets show our method can significantly improve state-of-the-art methods with easy implementation and negligible computational overhead.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article about multi-interest learning in recommender systems. Let me go through the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Multi-Interest Learning&#34; and &#34;Candidate Matching.&#34; So those are definitely primary categories. The abstract talks about improving training schemes, specifically addressing problems with the current training objectives and routing collapse. That points to Training Strategies as a key category.

They propose a framework called REMI which includes Interest-aware Hard Negative mining (IHN) and Routing Regularization (RR). These seem like specific techniques within the broader categories, so I should include those as well.

The focus is on enhancing multi-interest representations through optimization objectives and information composition. So Optimization Objectives and Representation Learning are relevant here.

They applied their method to real-world datasets with significant improvements over existing methods, which shows Real-World Applications. Since it&#39;s a general framework applicable to various methods, General Frameworks fit too.

Looking at the problem aspects, they address issues like the increase in easy negative samples and routing collapse, so Problem Analysis is another category. Their work contributes by enhancing expressiveness of multi-interest models, hence Model Enhancement.

The framework targets recommendation systems specifically, so Recommendation Systems is a must. Also, since it&#39;s about how different interests are handled and represented, Interest Representation makes sense.

I should avoid too specific categories that might not be widely applicable but stick to those that clearly relate to the article&#39;s content.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories. Let&#39;s start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Multi-Interest Learning for Candidate Matching in Recommender Systems.&#34; So, it&#39;s clearly about recommendation systems, specifically focusing on handling multiple interests when matching candidates. 

Looking at the abstract, the authors discuss issues with current training schemes in multi-interest learning. They identify two main problems: the training objective using uniform softmax which leads to too many easy negatives and a routing collapse where each interest only captures info from one item.

The proposed solution is the REMI framework with IHN and RR methods. IHN deals with hard negative mining, and RR prevents routing collapse. The paper shows improved results across three datasets.

So, the key themes here are multi-interest learning, training frameworks, candidate matching in recommenders, and specific solutions like hard negative mining and regularization.

Now, considering the categories to assign:

1. **Multi-Armed Bandits**: Not directly mentioned, but it&#39;s a broader category; maybe not the best fit.
2. **Family of Algorithm**: The paper deals with model architecture and training frameworks, so perhaps &#34;Training Frameworks&#34; or &#34;Model Architecture.&#34;
3. **Domain of Problem**: Recommender Systems is explicitly stated.
4. **Specific Aspects in Recommendation Space**: Multi-Interest Learning is a specific aspect they focus on.
5. Evaluation aspects aren&#39;t the main focus here, but they do mention experiments, so maybe something like &#34;Evaluation Metrics&#34; could be relevant.
6. They propose new methods to address specific issues, so &#34;New Methods&#34; or &#34;Proposed Solutions.&#34;
7. The problem relates to handling multiple interests and improving model training, so perhaps &#34;Model Training.&#34;
8. Since the paper addresses challenges in existing approaches, &#34;Challenges in Recommender Systems&#34; might be a good category.
9. They propose regularization techniques, so &#34;Regularization&#34; is relevant.
10. Also, they mention hard negative mining, which falls under &#34;Hard Negative Mining.&#34;

I should also consider if there are other relevant categories like &#34;Scalability,&#34; but the abstract doesn&#39;t discuss scaling. However, it does talk about implementation being easy and low computational overhead, so maybe &#34;Implementation Efficiency&#34; could be a category.

Wait, the user&#39;s example output includes things like &#34;Cold Start&#34; or &#34;Web Systems.&#34; In this case, since they&#39;re talking about candidate matching and model training in recommenders, I think the categories should reflect that without adding too specific ones unless they fit.

So, compiling the list: Recommender Systems, Multi-Interest Learning, Training Frameworks, Candidate Matching, Hard Negative Mining, Routing Regularization, Model Architecture, Proposed Solutions, Implementation Efficiency. That&#39;s 9 categories. Maybe add &#34;Reproducibility&#34; since they provide source code, but it&#39;s not explicitly stated. Alternatively, stick to the main points.

Alternatively, perhaps &#34;Algorithm Improvements&#34; could be a category as they&#39;re improving existing methods. Also, &#34;Collaborative Filtering&#34; is a family of algorithms used in recommenders, so that might fit too.

Wait, let me count again: 1. Recommender Systems, 2. Multi-Interest Learning, 3. Candidate Matching, 4. Training Frameworks, 5. Hard Negative Mining, 6. Routing Regularization, 7. Model Architecture, 8. Proposed Solutions, 9. Implementation Efficiency.

That&#39;s nine categories. Maybe add one more if needed, but I think this covers the key aspects without being too granular.
&lt;/think&gt;
