        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Two-sided Calibration for Quality-aware Responsible Recommendation
Abstract:
Calibration in recommender systems ensures that the user’s interests distribution over groups of items is reflected with their corresponding proportions in the recommendation, which has gained increasing attention recently. For example, a user who watched 80 entertainment videos and 20 knowledge videos is expected to receive recommendations comprising about 80% entertainment and 20% knowledge videos as well.  However, with the increasing calls for quality-aware responsible recommendation, it has become inadequate to just match users’ historical behaviors, which could still lead to undesired effects at the system level (e.g., overwhelming clickbaits). In this paper, we envision the two-sided calibration task that not only matches the users’ past interests distribution (user-level calibration) but also guarantees an overall target exposure distribution of different item groups (system-level calibration).  The target group exposure distribution can be explicitly pursued by users, platform owners, and even the law (e.g., the platform owners expect about 50% knowledge video recommendation on the whole). To support this scenario, we propose a post-processing method named PCT. PCT first solves personalized calibration targets that minimize the changes in users’ historical interest distributions while ensuring the overall target group exposure distribution. Then, PCT reranks the original recommendation lists according to personalized calibration targets to generate both relevant and two-sided calibrated recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to calibrated and fairness-aware recommendation approaches. We also release a new dataset with item quality annotations to support further studies about quality-aware responsible recommendation.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through the information provided.

The title is &#34;Two-sided Calibration for Quality-aware Responsible Recommendation.&#34; That already gives me some keywords: calibration, quality-aware, responsible recommendation. The term &#34;two-sided&#34; suggests it involves both user-level and system-level aspects.

Looking at the abstract, they talk about ensuring that recommendations reflect users&#39; interest distributions. For example, if a user watched mostly entertainment videos, they should get more entertainment in their recommendations. But they also mention the need for quality-aware responsible recommendation, which means just matching past behavior isn&#39;t enough—it can lead to issues like too many clickbaits.

The paper introduces two-sided calibration, which includes both user-level (matching past interests) and system-level (overall target distribution). They mention that platforms might have targets, like 50% knowledge videos. The method they propose is called PCT, a post-processing approach that reranks recommendations to meet these targets while keeping them relevant.

They also talk about experiments showing their method outperforms others and releasing a new dataset with item quality annotations.

Now, I need to map this into categories based on the guidelines. Let me think of each possible category:

1. **Calibration**: Clearly central as it&#39;s in the title.
2. **Quality-aware Recommendation**: Another key term from the title.
3. **Responsible Recommendation**: Also from the title and a growing area.
4. **Two-sided Calibration**: Specific method discussed.
5. **User-level calibration**: Part of their approach, focusing on individual user interests.
6. **System-level calibration**: The other part, ensuring overall distribution targets.
7. **Re-ranking Methods**: PCT reranks recommendations.
8. **Fairness in Recommendations**: Aligns with responsible recommendation and balancing exposures.
9. **Implicit Feedback**: Maybe not directly mentioned, but the idea of reflecting user behavior could relate to implicit feedback like clicks/views.
10. **Personalization**: Tailoring recommendations to user interests.
11. **Content Exposure Management**: Managing how different content types are exposed in recommendations.
12. **Beyond Accuracy**: Since they emphasize quality and responsibility beyond just accuracy metrics.

I think these categories cover the main aspects of the paper, ensuring discoverability without overcrowding any category. They also align with potential user interests looking into responsible AI or recommendation fairness.
&lt;/think&gt;
