        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Social Influence Bias in Recommender Systems: A Methodology for Learning, Analyzing, and Mitigating Bias in Ratings
Abstract:
To facilitate browsing and selection, almost all recommender systems display an aggregate statistic (the average/mean or median rating value) for each item. This value has potential to influence a participant’s individual rating for an item due to what is known in the survey and psychology literature as Social Influence Bias; the tendency for individuals to conform to what they perceive as the norm in a community. As a result, ratings can be closer to the average and less diverse than they would be otherwise. We propose a methodology to 1) learn, 2) analyze, and 3) mitigate the effect of social influence bias in recommender systems. In the Learning phase, a baseline dataset is established with an initial set of participants by allowing them to rate items twice: before seeing the median rating, and again after seeing it. In the Analysis phase, a new non-parametric significance test based on the Wilcoxon statistic can quantify the extent of social influence bias in this data. If this bias is significant, we propose a Mitigation phase where mathematical models are constructed from this data using polynomial regression and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and then inverted to produce a filter that can reduce the effect of social influence bias. As a case study, we apply this methodology to the California Report Card (CRC), a new recommender system that encourages political engagement. After the Learning phase collected 9390 ratings, the non-parametric test in the Analysis phase rejected the null hypothesis, identifying significant social influence bias: ratings after display of the median were on average 19.3% closer to the median value. In the Mitigating phase, the learned polynomial models were able to predict changed ratings with a normalized RMSE of 12.8% and reduce bias by 76.3%. Results suggest that social influence bias can be significant in recommender systems and that this bias can be substantially reduced with machine learning.

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about Social Influence Bias in Recommender Systems. Let&#39;s start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Social Influence Bias,&#34; which immediately makes me think of user behavior and how recommendations might influence users towards a perceived norm. The abstract talks about how recommender systems display aggregate statistics like average or median ratings, which can affect individual ratings due to social bias. They propose a methodology with learning, analysis, and mitigation phases.

In the Learning phase, participants rate items before and after seeing the median rating. That sounds like it&#39;s related to user studies because they&#39;re gathering data through participant interaction. The Analysis phase uses a non-parametric significance test based on Wilcoxon statistic—so that involves statistical methods and evaluation techniques.

The Mitigation phase uses polynomial regression and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for modeling, which are machine learning concepts. They applied this to the California Report Card (CRC), a recommender system focused on political engagement, so domain-wise it&#39;s in politics or governance. They mention using A/B testing as part of their evaluation, indicating real-world applications.

The abstract also discusses reducing bias by 76.3%, which ties into fairness and ethics in AI. The fact that they&#39;re looking at the impact of ratings being closer to the median suggests an emphasis on diversity in recommendations since less diverse ratings might lead to less varied suggestions for users.

They talk about evaluation beyond just accuracy, focusing on how social influence affects recommendation quality. This goes into aspects like user behavior analysis and system evaluation metrics beyond traditional measures.

Putting this all together, I need to map these elements into relevant categories. Let me think of the examples provided:

- Algorithm family: They used polynomial regression and Bayesian methods, so those are specific algorithms.
- Domain: It&#39;s applied in a political context, so governance or politics is appropriate.
- Specific recommendation aspects: Cold start might not be directly applicable here since they&#39;re dealing with existing items. However, the methodology could relate to user behavior modeling.
- Evaluation aspects: They discussed diversity and beyond accuracy metrics, which are important evaluation criteria.
- Real-world applications include A/B testing and user studies.

I should also consider broader categories like fairness and bias mitigation since that&#39;s a core part of their research. The use of machine learning techniques falls under that as well. Additionally, the article discusses system design aspects, particularly how displaying average ratings affects users, which ties into interface design considerations in recommendation systems.

So, compiling these thoughts into categories: Social Influence Bias is a key theme, so it&#39;s its own category. Methodology and user studies are relevant because they involve participant interaction. They used specific machine learning techniques like polynomial regression and Bayesian methods. The domain here is politics or governance as applied to the CRC system. Evaluation aspects include diversity of recommendations, beyond accuracy metrics, fairness, and bias mitigation.

They conducted real-world applications through A/B testing and user surveys, which are important for validation. Statistical methods like non-parametric tests were used in analysis. This also ties into recommendation systems design, particularly how interface elements (like showing average ratings) influence user behavior.

I think that covers the main points. Let me make sure I have at least 8-12 categories as per guidelines.
&lt;/think&gt;

Social Influence Bias, Recommender Systems, User Behavior, Machine Learning, Governance/POLitics, Statistical Methods, Fairness, A/B Testing, User Studies, Bayesian Methods, Polynomial Regression, Evaluation Metrics, System Design, Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy, Bias Mitigation.</code></pre>
