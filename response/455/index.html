        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Relaxed Softmax for PU Learning
Abstract:
In recent years, the softmax model and its fast approximations have become the de-facto loss functions for deep neural networks when dealing with multi-class prediction. This loss has been extended to language modeling and recommendation, two fields that fall into the framework of learning from Positive and Unlabeled data. In this paper, we stress the different drawbacks of the current family of softmax losses and sampling schemes when applied in a Positive and Unlabeled learning setup. We propose both a Relaxed Softmax loss (RS) and a new negative sampling scheme based on a Boltzmann formulation. We show that the new training objective is better suited for the tasks of density estimation, item similarity and next-event prediction by driving uplifts in performance on textual and recommendation datasets against classical softmax.

Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article titled &#34;Relaxed Softmax for PU Learning&#34; based on its abstract. Let me break down the information step by step.

First, the title mentions &#34;PU Learning,&#34; which stands for Positive and Unlabeled learning. That&#39;s a type of machine learning problem where you have positive examples and unlabeled data but no negative examples. So that should definitely be one category.

The abstract talks about the softmax model and its approximations being used as loss functions in deep neural networks for multi-class predictions. This suggests that &#34;Softmax&#34; is an important category here since the paper is focusing on improving this particular loss function.

They mention extending softmax to language modeling and recommendation systems. So, &#34;Language Modeling&#34; and &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; are definitely relevant categories because these are the domains where their proposed method applies.

The main contribution of the article is introducing a new approach called Relaxed Softmax (RS) along with a novel negative sampling scheme based on Boltzmann distribution. Therefore, I should include both &#34;Relaxed Softmax&#34; and &#34;Negative Sampling&#34; as categories since they&#39;re key components of their solution.

They test their method on tasks like density estimation, item similarity, and next-event prediction. These are specific aspects or applications within recommendation systems, so including them makes the categorization more precise for users interested in those areas.

The experiments were conducted using textual and recommendation datasets, which means &#34;Textual Data&#34; should also be a category to capture that aspect of their work.

Additionally, since the paper is about improving the softmax loss for PU learning in these domains, categories like &#34;Deep Neural Networks&#34; and &#34;Multi-Class Classification&#34; are relevant because they form the foundation of their approach.

Putting it all together, I need to ensure each article is assigned 8-12 categories. So far, I have PU Learning, Softmax, Language Modeling, Recommendation Systems, Relaxed Softmax, Negative Sampling, Density Estimation, Item Similarity, Next-Event Prediction, Textual Data, Deep Neural Networks, and Multi-Class Classification. That gives me twelve categories, which fits the guidelines.

I should also check if any other aspects are important. For instance, they discuss Boltzmann formulations for sampling, but since &#34;Negative Sampling&#34; already covers that aspect, I don&#39;t need an additional category unless it&#39;s more specific than what&#39;s covered. Similarly, the focus on performance improvements could relate to evaluation metrics, but since the paper emphasizes tasks like density estimation and item similarity, those categories suffice.

I should avoid creating too many niche categories that might not be frequently searched by users. Instead, sticking with broad yet relevant terms ensures better discoverability. Also, maintaining consistency in how each article is categorized will help in keeping the interface user-friendly.
&lt;/think&gt;
