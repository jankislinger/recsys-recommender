Title: Modelling Contextual Information in Session-Aware Recommender Systems with Neural Networks
Abstract:
Preparing recommendations for unknown users or such that correctly respond to the short-term needs of a particular user is one of the fundamental problems for e-commerce. Most of the common Recommender Systems assume that user identification must be explicit. In this paper a Session-Aware Recommender System approach is presented where no straightforward user information is required. The recommendation process is based only on user activity within a single session, defined as a sequence of events. This information is incorporated in the recommendation process by explicit context modeling with factorization methods and a novel approach with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Compared to the session modeling approach, RNN directly models the dependency of user observed sequential behavior throughout its recurrent structure. The evaluation discusses the results based on sessions from real-life system with ephemeral items (identified only by the set of their attributes) for the task of top-n best recommendations.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Modelling Contextual Information in Session-Aware Recommender Systems with Neural Networks.&#34; So it&#39;s about recommendation systems that are session-aware and use neural networks, specifically focusing on contextual information.

Looking at the abstract, the main points are:
- Addresses the problem of recommending for unknown users or meeting short-term needs in e-commerce.
- Common recommender systems require explicit user identification, but this approach doesn&#39;t need that.
- It&#39;s a Session-Aware Recommender System that uses only user activity within a single session as a sequence of events.
- They incorporate context modeling using factorization methods and a novel RNN approach.
- RNN is used because it can model dependencies in sequential behavior effectively.
- The evaluation uses real-life sessions with ephemeral items (only identified by attributes) for top-N recommendations.

Now, I need to map this to the categories provided. Let me go through each potential category:

1. **Session-Aware Recommendations**: Definitely relevant since the paper is about session-aware systems.
2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: They explicitly mention using RNNs as a novel approach.
3. **Contextual Recommendation**: The title mentions modelling contextual information, so this fits.
4. **E-commerce**: The problem is set in e-commerce, so that&#39;s applicable.
5. **User Behavior Modelling**: They analyze user activity within sessions, which relates to behavior modeling.
6. **Sequential Data**: Since they model sequences of events, sequential data is a good category.
7. **Real-World Applications**: They evaluate using real-life system data, so this applies.
8. **Cold Start**: The paper deals with unknown users, which ties into the cold start problem in recommendations.
9. **Top-N Recommendations**: The evaluation task is top-N, so that&#39;s relevant.
10. **Recommender Systems**: Obviously a core category here.
11. **Neural Networks**: They use neural networks, specifically RNNs.
12. **Implicit Feedback**: Since they don&#39;t require explicit user info, the recommendations are based on implicit behavior (clicks, actions in a session).

I think these cover all aspects of the paper without overlapping too much. I&#39;ve avoided creating too specific categories that might not have enough articles later. Each category seems to fit well with the content and aligns with user interests in recommendation systems.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, I need to categorize this research article about session-aware recommender systems using neural networks. Let&#39;s start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Modelling Contextual Information in Session-Aware Recommender Systems with Neural Networks.&#34; So it&#39;s clearly related to recommendation systems, specifically session-aware ones that use neural networks. 

Looking at the abstract, it talks about preparing recommendations for unknown users or short-term needs. It compares existing methods which rely on explicit user information and presents a new approach using only user activity within a single session. The system models context with factorization methods and an RNN, which directly captures sequential behavior through its structure.

So, breaking this down:

1. **Session-Aware Recommender Systems**: This is a primary category because the paper focuses on systems that consider the current user session for recommendations.
2. **Neural Networks**: The article uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), so neural networks are definitely relevant here.
3. **Contextual Information**: They model contextual information within sessions, which should be another category.
4. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: Specifically mentioning the type of neural network used is important for categorization.
5. **Session Modeling**: Since they discuss modeling user activity within a session, this is another key category.
6. **Recommendation Systems**: This is a broader category that encompasses all recommendation-related topics.
7. **Explicit Context Modeling**: The paper uses factorization methods and RNNs to model context explicitly, so including &#34;Explicit Context&#34; makes sense.

I should check if there are other relevant categories from the guidelines. The example included things like problem domains (e.g., Books, Movies), but this paper doesn&#39;t specify a particular domain—it&#39;s more about the methodology. Also, aspects of evaluation were mentioned in examples, but the abstract focuses on the method rather than the evaluation metrics specifically.

So, the main categories I identified are Session-Aware Recommender Systems, Neural Networks, Contextual Information, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Session Modeling, Recommendation Systems, and Explicit Context Modeling. 

I think that&#39;s a solid set of 7 categories as per the guidelines, covering both specific techniques and broader topics to ensure discoverability without overcrowding any single category.
&lt;/think&gt;
