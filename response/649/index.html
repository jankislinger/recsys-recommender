        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Negative Interactions for Improved Collaborative-Filtering: Don’t go Deeper, go Higher
Abstract:
The recommendation-accuracy of collaborative filtering approaches is typically improved when taking into account higher-order interactions [5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 16, 18, 24, 25, 28, 31, 34, 36, 41, 42, 44]. While deep nonlinear models are theoretically able to learn higher-order interactions, their capabilities were, however, found to be quite limited in practice [5]. Moreover, the use of low-dimensional embeddings in deep networks may severely limit their expressiveness [8]. This motivated us in this paper to explore a simple extension of linear full-rank models that allow for higher-order interactions as additional explicit input-features. Interestingly, we observed that this model-class obtained by far the best ranking accuracies on the largest data set in our experiments, while it was still competitive with various state-of-the-art deep-learning models on the smaller data sets. Moreover, our approach can also be interpreted as a simple yet effective improvement of the (linear) HOSLIM [11] model: by simply removing the constraint that the learned higher-order interactions have to be non-negative, we observed that the accuracy-gains due to higher-order interactions more than doubled in our experiments. The reason for this large improvement was that large positive higher-order interactions (as used in HOSLIM [11]) are relatively infrequent compared to the number of large negative higher-order interactions in the three well-known data-sets used in our experiments. We further characterize the circumstances where the higher-order interactions provide the most significant improvements.

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task. The article is about improving collaborative filtering by considering negative interactions and using higher-order interactions without the non-negativity constraint. 

First, I&#39;ll look at the title: &#34;Negative Interactions for Improved Collaborative-Filtering: Don’t go Deeper, go Higher.&#34; This suggests that negative interactions are a key focus and that higher-order interactions are being utilized instead of deeper models.

The abstract mentions collaborative filtering approaches improving recommendation accuracy by considering higher-order interactions. It compares deep nonlinear models with linear full-rank models extended to include these interactions. The paper found that allowing negative higher-order interactions significantly improved accuracy compared to the HOSLIM model, which only used positive ones. 

So, starting with algorithm families: Collaborative Filtering is definitely a main one. Higher-Order Interactions and Negative Interactions are specific aspects of this method. Since they&#39;re comparing linear vs deep models, Deep Learning should be another category.

Looking at recommendation-specific terms, the focus on improving recommendations points to Recommendation Accuracy. They discuss experiments on real datasets, so Real-world Applications are relevant. The approach is an extension or improvement over HOSLIM, so that&#39;s a specific model in the space.

They talk about evaluation aspects beyond just accuracy, considering things like expressiveness of models and how higher-order interactions affect performance. So Beyond Accuracy makes sense as a category.

The methodology involves explicit features and modifications to existing models, so Explicit Features is another relevant area. The experiments show significant improvements over HOSLIM, highlighting Model Improvements.

Putting it all together: Collaborative Filtering, Higher-Order Interactions, Negative Interactions, Deep Learning, Recommendation Accuracy, Real-world Applications, HOSLIM (as a model), Beyond Accuracy, Explicit Features, and Model Improvements.
&lt;/think&gt;
