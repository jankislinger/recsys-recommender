        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: A Personalised Reader for Crowd Curated Content
Abstract:
Personalised news recommender systems traditionally rely on content ingested from a select set of publishers and ask users to indicate their interests from a predefined list of topics. They then provide users a feed of news items for each of their topics. In this demo, we present a mobile app that automatically learns users’ interests from their browsing or twitter history and provides them with a personalised feed of diverse, crowd curated content. The app also continuously learns from the users’ interactions as they swipe to like or skip items recommended to them. In addition, users can discover trending stories and content liked by other users they follow. The crowd is thus formed of the users, who as a whole act as the curators of the content to be recommended.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through both carefully.

The title is &#34;A Personalised Reader for Crowd Curated Content.&#34; That suggests it&#39;s about personalization in recommendation systems that use crowd-sourced or community-curated content. 

Looking at the abstract, it talks about a mobile app that learns user interests from their browsing and Twitter history. The system provides personalized news feeds by analyzing these interactions. Users can swipe to like or skip items, which helps the app learn more about their preferences over time. Additionally, users can discover trending stories and content liked by others they follow, emphasizing the community aspect in curating recommendations.

So, key themes I notice here are:

1. **Personalization**: The system tailors content to individual user interests.
2. **Crowd Curated Content**: Users collectively contribute to what gets recommended.
3. **User Interactions**: Learning from swipes and other interactions to improve recommendations.
4. **Trending Stories**: Highlighting popular or trending content among users.
5. **Social Features**: Incorporating the content liked by followed users, adding a social layer.
6. **Machine Learning**: The system automatically learns from user data over time.

Now, mapping these themes to categories:

- **Personalized News** fits because it&#39;s specifically about news recommendations tailored to users.
- **Crowd Curated Content** is directly mentioned in the title and abstract.
- **User Interaction** is crucial as the app learns from user actions like swiping.
- **Trending Stories** are a feature highlighted, so that&#39;s relevant.
- **Social Recommendations** because users influence each other through their interactions.
- **Machine Learning** underpins how the system adapts over time.

I think these categories cover the main aspects of the article. They should help users find the article when searching for topics related to personalization, social features, or machine learning in recommendation systems. I&#39;m avoiding overly broad categories unless necessary, but focusing on what&#39;s specific to this work.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I&#39;m trying to figure out how to categorize this research article. Let me read through it again.

The title is &#34;A Personalised Reader for Crowd Curated Content.&#34; So, it&#39;s about personalized news recommendations using crowd curation. The abstract mentions that traditional systems rely on content from specific publishers and user topics. This demo presents a mobile app that learns users&#39; interests from their browsing or Twitter history. It provides a personalized feed of diverse, crowd-curated content. Users can swipe to like or skip items, which helps the app learn more about their preferences. Additionally, users can discover trending stories and content liked by others they follow.

So, key themes here are personalization in news recommendation, crowd curation, mobile apps, user interaction learning, swiping behavior (which is a type of implicit feedback), diversity in recommendations, user-generated content, social influence (since users see what others like), and maybe real-world applications because it&#39;s a demo with a mobile app.

Let me break this down:

1. **Personalised News Recommender Systems**: Directly related to the core topic.
2. **Crowd Curated Content**: The app uses the crowd as curators, so that&#39;s another category.
3. **Mobile App**: It&#39;s a specific application context, so &#34;Mobile&#34; makes sense.
4. **User Interaction Learning**: They learn from swiping actions, which is about how user behavior informs recommendations.
5. **Implicit Feedback**: Swiping to like or skip is a form of implicit feedback.
6. **Diversity of Recommendations**: The app aims to provide diverse content.
7. **Social Influence/Networks**: Users see what others they follow have liked, so social influence plays a role here.
8. **Real-World Applications/Demos**: It&#39;s a demo with a mobile app, indicating it&#39;s applied in real-world contexts.

I think these cover the main points without being too narrow or too broad. Each category should be useful and not overloaded.
&lt;/think&gt;
