        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Global and Personalized Graphs for Heterogeneous Sequential Recommendation by Learning Behavior Transitions and User Intentions
Abstract:
Heterogeneous sequential recommendation (HSR) is a very important recommendation problem, which aims to predict a user’s next interacted item under a target behavior type (e.g., purchase in e-commerce sites) based on his/her historical interactions with different behaviors. Though existing sequential methods have achieved advanced performance by considering the varied impacts of interactions with sequential information, a large body of them still have two major shortcomings. Firstly, they usually model different behaviors separately without considering the correlations between them. The transitions from item to item under diverse behaviors indicate some users’ potential behavior manner. Secondly, though the behavior information contains a user’s fine-grained interests, the insufficient consideration of the local context information limits them from well understanding user intentions. Utilizing the adjacent interactions to better understand a user’s behavior could improve the certainty of prediction. To address these two issues, we propose a novel solution utilizing global and personalized graphs for HSR (GPG4HSR) to learn behavior transitions and user intentions. Specifically, our GPG4HSR consists of two graphs, i.e., a global graph to capture the transitions between different behaviors, and a personalized graph to model items with behaviors by further considering the distinct user intentions of the adjacent contextually relevant nodes. Extensive experiments on four public datasets with the state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate the effectiveness and general applicability of our method GPG4HSR.

Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about &#34;Global and Personalized Graphs for Heterogeneous Sequential Recommendation.&#34; Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title, it mentions &#34;Graphs,&#34; so that&#39;s a clear category. The focus is on recommendation systems, specifically sequential ones, which deal with predicting a user&#39;s next action based on their history. So, I&#39;ll note &#34;Sequential Recommendation.&#34;

The abstract talks about modeling different behaviors and their transitions, which suggests it&#39;s handling multiple types of interactions users have. That points to &#34;Multi-Modal Interactions&#34; because the system isn&#39;t just looking at one type of data but various user actions.

It also mentions capturing behavior transitions, so another category could be &#34;Behavior Transitions.&#34; This is about how users switch between different actions or items over time.

The method uses both global and personalized graphs. The global graph captures overall patterns across all users, while the personalized graph focuses on individual user intentions. So, I&#39;ll include &#34;Personalized Graphs&#34; and maybe just &#34;Graphs&#34; as a broader category since it&#39;s a key component of their approach.

The problem they&#39;re addressing is in recommendation systems, specifically for e-commerce where behaviors like purchases are important. So, &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; is definitely a main category.

They mention considering the context around user interactions to better understand intentions. This leads me to think about categories like &#34;Contextual Recommendations&#34; or &#34;User Intentions.&#34; Since the abstract emphasizes understanding the adjacent interactions (context), I&#39;ll go with &#34;Contextual Recommendations.&#34;

The evaluation part isn&#39;t explicitly detailed, but since they&#39;re comparing against state-of-the-art methods and testing on public datasets, it&#39;s likely they&#39;re focusing on accuracy. However, there&#39;s also a mention of improving prediction certainty, which might touch on aspects beyond just traditional metrics, so perhaps &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; as a category.

They also talk about heterogeneous sequential recommendation, which is a specific area within recommendation systems, so that should be included as a primary category.

Putting it all together, I need to make sure each article is in 8-12 categories. Let me list what I have:

1. Graphs
2. Sequential Recommendation
3. Multi-Modal Interactions
4. Behavior Transitions
5. Personalized Graphs
6. Recommendation Systems
7. Contextual Recommendations
8. Heterogeneous Sequential Recommendation

I should check if any other relevant categories fit. They use both global and personalized approaches, so &#34;Personalization&#34; is another good category to include because it&#39;s about tailoring recommendations to individual users.

Additionally, since they mention experiments on public datasets and comparing with state-of-the-art methods, perhaps &#34;Evaluation Metrics&#34; or something related could be included, but the example categories didn&#39;t specify that. Alternatively, &#34;User Intentions&#34; might fit as another specific aspect.

I think I have enough categories now, covering both the method (graphs, personalized), the problem area (sequential recommendation, recommendation systems), and specific aspects like behavior transitions and context.
&lt;/think&gt;
