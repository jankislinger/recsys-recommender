        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Right Tool, Right Job: Recommendation for Repeat and Exploration Consumption in Food Delivery
Abstract:
From e-commerce to music and news, recommender systems are tailored to specific scenarios. While researching generic models applicable to various scenarios is crucial, studying recommendations based on the unique characteristics of a specific and vital scenario holds both research and, more importantly, practical value. In this paper, we focus on store recommendations in the food delivery scenario, which is an intriguing and significant domain with unique behavior patterns and influential factors. First, we offer an in-depth analysis of real-world food delivery data across platforms and countries, revealing that (i) repeat and exploration orders are both noticeable behaviors and (ii) the influences of historical and collaborative situations on repeat and exploration consumption are distinct. Second, based on the observations, we separately design two simple yet effective recommendation models: \textit{RepRec} for repeat orders and \textit{ExpRec} for exploration ones. An ensemble module is further proposed to combine recommendations from two models for a unified recommendation list. Finally, experiments are conducted on three datasets spanning three countries across two food delivery platforms. Results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed recommenders on repeat, exploration, and combined recommendation tasks over various baselines. Such simple yet effective approaches will be beneficial for real applications. This work shows that dedicated analyses and methods for domain-specific characteristics are essential for the recommender system studies.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article about food delivery recommendations. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Right Tool, Right Job: Recommendation for Repeat and Exploration Consumption in Food Delivery.&#34; So it&#39;s about recommendation systems specifically tailored for food delivery services. The abstract mentions that while generic models are important, studying specific scenarios like food delivery can provide both research and practical value.

Looking at the content, they analyze real-world data across platforms and countries, focusing on two types of orders: repeat and exploration. They developed two models, RepRec and ExpRec, for each type and an ensemble module to combine them. The experiments were conducted on datasets from three countries using two food delivery platforms, showing their recommenders outperformed baselines.

Now, I need to assign multiple categories based on the guidelines. Let me think about the relevant aspects:

1. **Domain of the Problem**: Clearly, this is in the food delivery sector. So &#34;Food Delivery&#34; is a category.
2. **Family of Algorithm**: They used specific models for repeats and exploration but didn&#39;t mention the exact algorithm family like Matrix Factorization or Neural Networks. Maybe just leave it as is unless they specify more details.
3. **Recommendation Types**: Since they distinguish between repeat and exploration, categories like &#34;Repeat Recommendations&#34; and &#34;Exploration Recommendations&#34; make sense.
4. **Evaluation Aspects**: They discuss performance in both types of recommendations, so &#34;Recommendation Performance&#34; or something similar could be applicable.
5. **Real-World Applications**: The paper mentions real-world data and practical value, so including &#34;A/B Test&#34; might not fit unless they did such tests. Wait, the abstract doesn&#39;t mention A/B testing but does talk about experiments across datasets, which is more like empirical evaluation. So perhaps &#34;Empirical Evaluation&#34; or similar.
6. **Cross-Cultural Analysis**: They analyzed data from multiple countries and platforms, so that&#39;s another category.
7. **Recommendation Systems**: Broadly applicable as it&#39;s a recommendation study.
8. **Ensemble Methods**: They used an ensemble module to combine recommendations, so that&#39;s another category.

I should aim for 8-12 categories. Let me list possible ones:

- Food Delivery: Direct from the domain.
- Repeat Recommendations: As they focus on repeat orders.
- Exploration Recommendations: Focused on exploration behavior.
- Recommendation Systems: General category.
- Cross-Cultural Analysis: Since data spans multiple countries and platforms.
- Domain-Specific Recommendations: They emphasize tailored approaches for a specific domain.
- Ensemble Methods: Used to combine models.
- Empirical Evaluation: Conducted experiments with real-world data.
- Model Design: Developed two separate models.
- Performance Evaluation: Showcased the effectiveness of their approach.

Wait, I should ensure these are clear and descriptive. Maybe &#34;Cross-Cultural&#34; is better as a single term. Also, considering whether categories like &#34;Real World Applications&#34; fit since they mention practical value but didn&#39;t specify if they implemented in real apps.

I think the list looks good. Let me compile them.
&lt;/think&gt;
