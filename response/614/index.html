        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Towards Multi-Language Recipe Personalisation and Recommendation
Abstract:
Multi-language recipe personalisation and recommendation is an under-explored field of information retrieval in academic and production systems. The existing gaps in our current understanding are numerous, even on fundamental questions such as whether consistent and high-quality recipe recommendation can be delivered across languages. Motivated by this need, we consider the multi-language recipe recommendation setting and present grounding results that will help to establish the potential and absolute value of future work in this area. Our work draws on several billion events from millions of recipes, with published recipes and users incorporating several languages, including Arabic, English, Indonesian, Russian, and Spanish. We represent recipes using a combination of normalised ingredients, standardised skills and image embeddings obtained without human intervention. In modelling, we take a classical approach based on optimising an embedded bi-linear user-item metric space towards the interactions that most strongly elicit cooking intent. For users without interaction histories, a bespoke content-based cold-start model that predicts context and recipe affinity is introduced. We show that our approach to personalisation is stable and scales well to new languages. A robust cross-validation campaign is employed and consistently rejects baseline models and representations, strongly favouring those we propose. Our results are presented in a language-oriented (as opposed to model-oriented) fashion to emphasise the language-based goals of this work. We believe that this is the first large-scale work that evaluates the value and potential of multi-language recipe recommendation and personalisation.

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task step by step. I&#39;m new to this, but I&#39;ll try my best to follow the guidelines provided.

First, I need to understand the article&#39;s content. The title is &#34;Towards Multi-Language Recipe Personalisation and Recommendation.&#34; The abstract mentions that it&#39;s an under-explored field in information retrieval, focusing on delivering consistent recipe recommendations across different languages. They used data from several billion events involving millions of recipes and users across languages like Arabic, English, Indonesian, Russian, and Spanish.

The methods include representing recipes with normalized ingredients, standardized skills, and image embeddings without human intervention. The model uses an embedded bi-linear user-item metric space to optimize interactions showing cooking intent. For new users without interaction histories, a content-based cold-start model is introduced. They conducted robust cross-validation and found their approach outperformed baseline models.

Now, I need to categorize this article into 8-12 categories based on the guidelines provided. The categories can be algorithm families, domains, recommendation aspects, evaluation aspects, real-world applications, etc.

Let me list possible categories:

1. **Multi-Language Recommendations**: Since the focus is on recipe recommendations across multiple languages.
2. **Recipe Recommendation**: Specific domain of recipes.
3. **Personalization**: The article discusses personalization techniques.
4. **Content-Based Filtering**: They used content-based methods for cold-start.
5. **Cross-Validation**: Mentioned as part of their evaluation method.
6. **Recommendation Systems**: General category as it&#39;s about recommendation algorithms.
7. **Cold Start Problem**: Addressing new users without interaction history.
8. **Large-Scale Data Analysis**: They used several billion events and millions of recipes.
9. **Embeddings**: Used image embeddings for recipe representation.
10. **User-Item Interaction Models**: The model optimizes user-item metric spaces.
11. **Cross-Lingual Evaluation**: Evaluated across multiple languages, emphasizing language-based goals.

Wait, the abstract also mentions using a classical approach with embedded bi-linear models and a robust cross-validation campaign that favors their proposed models over baselines. So perhaps &#34;Classical Approaches&#34; could be another category? Or maybe not necessary since they&#39;re building on existing methods but applying them in a new context.

Also, considering evaluation aspects beyond accuracy, like diversity of recommendations â€“ the abstract mentions emphasizing language-based goals, which might touch on aspects of diversity or multi-language coverage, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s explicit enough to warrant an &#34;Evaluation Beyond Accuracy&#34; category. It might be stretching it a bit.

Looking back at the example categories provided, they include things like domain (Books, Movies), recommendation-specific issues (Cold Start), evaluation aspects (Diversity of Recommendations). Since this article is about recipe recommendations across languages, I think the primary categories are clear: Multi-Language Recommendations, Recipe Recommendation, Personalization, etc.

I need to make sure each category is both specific and broad enough. For example, &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; is a broad category that makes sense here. Also, &#34;Cold Start Problem&#34; is a specific aspect of recommendation systems they addressed.

They mention using embeddings, which ties into machine learning techniques, so &#34;Embeddings&#34; as a category fits.

I think I have 11 categories listed above. Let me review them again to ensure they cover all aspects without overlapping too much:

- Multi-Language Recommendations
- Recipe Recommendation
- Personalization
- Content-Based Filtering
- Cross-Validation
- Recommendation Systems
- Cold Start Problem
- Large-Scale Data Analysis
- Embeddings
- User-Item Interaction Models
- Cross-Lingual Evaluation

These seem comprehensive and cover the algorithm, domain, specific recommendation aspects, evaluation methods, scale of data, and real-world application (cross-lingual). I think this set meets the requirements.
&lt;/think&gt;

Multi-Language Recommendations, Recipe Recommendation, Personalization, Content-Based Filtering, Cross-Validation, Recommendation Systems, Cold Start Problem, Large-Scale Data Analysis, Embeddings, User-Item Interaction Models, Cross-Lingual Evaluation</code></pre>
