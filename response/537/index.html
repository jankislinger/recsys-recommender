        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: FISSA: Fusing Item Similarity Models with Self-Attention Networks for Sequential Recommendation
Abstract:
Sequential recommendation has been a hot research topic because of its practicability and high accuracy by capturing the sequential information. As deep learning (DL) based methods being widely adopted to model the local and dynamic preferences beneath users’ behavior sequences, the modeling of users’ global and static preferences tends to be underestimated that usually, only some simple and crude users’ latent representations are introduced. Moreover, most existing methods hold an assumption that users’ intention can be fully captured by considering the historical behaviors, while neglect the possible uncertainty of users’ intention in reality, which may be influenced by the appearance of the candidate items to be recommended. In this paper, we thus focus on these two issues, i.e., the imperfect modeling of users’ global preferences in most DL-based sequential recommendation methods and the uncertainty of users’ intention brought by the candidate items, and propose a novel solution named fusing item similarity models with self-attention networks (FISSA) for sequential recommendation. Specifically, we treat the state-of-the-art self-attentive sequential recommendation (SASRec) model as the local representation learning module to capture the dynamic preferences beneath users’ behavior sequences in our FISSA, and further propose a global representation learning module to improve the modeling of users’ global preferences and a gating module that balances the local and global representations by taking the information of the candidate items into account. The global representation learning module can be seen as a location-based attention layer, which is effective to fit in well with the parallelization training process of the self-attention framework. The gating module calculates the weight by modeling the relationship among the candidate item, the recently interacted item and the global preference of each user using an MLP layer. Extensive empirical studies on five commonly used datasets show that our FISSA significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines in terms of two commonly used metrics.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article about FISSA into multiple relevant categories. Let&#39;s start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Fusing Item Similarity Models with Self-Attention Networks for Sequential Recommendation.&#34; So it&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically sequential ones, which means they consider the order of user interactions.

Looking at the abstract, they talk about deep learning methods used in sequential recommendation. They address two main issues: modeling global and static user preferences that are often overlooked and the uncertainty in users&#39; intentions influenced by candidate items. The solution is FISSA, which combines self-attention networks with item similarity models. 

The paper introduces a local representation module (SASRec) for dynamic preferences and a global representation module using location-based attention. There&#39;s also a gating module that balances these representations based on candidate items, using an MLP layer. They tested this on five datasets and found significant improvements over existing methods.

So, categorizing this:

1. **Sequential Recommendation**: It&#39;s the main focus.
2. **Deep Learning (DL)**: Since they&#39;re using DL methods.
3. **Self-Attention Networks**: Specifically mentioned as part of their approach.
4. **User Preference Modeling**: They discuss both local and global preferences.
5. **Hybrid Models**: Combining different techniques (item similarity with self-attention).
6. **Uncertainty in User Intent**: Addressing how user intent can be uncertain.
7. **Global Representation Learning**: One of the modules they developed.
8. **Local Representation Learning**: The other module, using SASRec.
9. **Recommendation Evaluation**: They tested on datasets and compared metrics.

I need to make sure these categories align with the guidelines: multiple categories (at least 8-12), clear names, and balance across categories. I think this covers all aspects without overcrowding any category.
&lt;/think&gt;
