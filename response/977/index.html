        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Complementary Product Recommendation for Long-tail Products
Abstract:
Identifying complementary relations between products plays a key role in e-commerce Recommender Systems (RS). Existing methods in Complementary Product Recommendation (CPR), however, focus only on identifying complementary relations in huge and data-rich catalogs, while none of them considers real-world scenarios of small and medium e-commerce platforms with limited number of interactions. In this paper, we discuss our research proposal that addresses the problem of identifying complementary relations in such sparse settings. To overcome the data sparsity problem, we propose to first learn complementary relations in large and data-rich catalogs and then transfer learned knowledge to small and scarce ones. To be able to map individual products across different catalogs and thus transfer learned relations between them, we propose to create Product Universal Embedding Space (PUES) using textual and visual product meta-data, which serves as a common ground for the products from arbitrary catalog.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about complementary product recommendation for long-tail products. The title mentions &#34;long-tail products,&#34; so that&#39;s definitely one category. It&#39;s in the e-commerce domain, so I&#39;ll add E-Commerce as another.

The abstract talks about recommender systems (RS), which is a specific area within recommendation technologies. So Recommender Systems and Recommendation Technologies are both relevant categories here.

Complementary Product Recommendation (CPR) is mentioned, so that should be its own category to focus on the specific aspect of recommendations. The article addresses data sparsity in small platforms, so Data Sparsity is another important category.

They propose using product embeddings, which relates to Product Embedding as a technique. They use textual and visual metadata for this, so Textual Data and Visual Data should be included as well.

The idea of transferring knowledge from large catalogs to smaller ones involves Transfer Learning, so that&#39;s another category. The article also discusses scalability since it&#39;s addressing issues in both small and large settings, making Scalability relevant too.

Lastly, the approach focuses on sparse data scenarios, which ties into Sparse Data Analysis. So putting it all together, these categories should accurately reflect the article&#39;s content.
&lt;/think&gt;
