        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Automated Recommendation of Healthy, Personalised Meal Plans
Abstract:
Poor health due to a lack of understanding of nutrition is a major problem in the modern world, one which could potentially be addressed via the use of recommender systems. In this demo we present a system to generate meal plans for users which they will not only like, based on their taste preferences, but will also conform to daily nutritional guidelines. The interface allows the selection of recipes for breakfast, lunch and dinner and can automatically complete a daily meal plan or can generate entire plans itself.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article about automated recommendation of healthy, personalized meal plans. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Automated Recommendation&#34; and &#34;Personalised Meal Plans.&#34; The abstract talks about using recommender systems to address poor health due to lack of nutrition understanding. It also describes an interface that allows users to select recipes for different meals and generate a daily plan automatically.

First, I&#39;ll identify the core themes. The main focus is on recommendation systems applied to meal planning with a health angle. So, categories related to recommender systems are essential here. 

Next, looking at the domain, this is clearly in the Health &amp; Wellness category because it&#39;s about improving nutrition and overall health. It also touches on personalization since the system tailors meal plans based on user preferences.

The interface mentioned suggests a focus on User Interface (UI) Design. The system helps users make better choices, so User Behavior or Decision Support could be relevant. Since it&#39;s generating plans that meet nutritional guidelines, that falls under Nutritional Recommendations.

Additionally, the article seems to have real-world applications since they&#39;re presenting a demo of the system, which involves A/B testing or user surveys for evaluationâ€”though these aren&#39;t explicitly mentioned, I&#39;ll consider them as possible categories.

I should also think about aspects like Personalization Algorithms and maybe even Data-Driven Decisions because the system likely uses data on user preferences and nutritional guidelines to make recommendations. Health Guidelines is another category since it&#39;s ensuring meals meet daily standards.

Looking at evaluation aspects, while not detailed here, the focus might include User Satisfaction or System Usability if those were discussed elsewhere in the article. But based on the given abstract, I&#39;ll stick with what&#39;s evident.

I need to assign 8-12 categories. Let me list them out:

1. Recommender Systems - because it&#39;s a recommendation engine.
2. Health &amp; Wellness - domain focus on health.
3. Personalization - tailored meal plans.
4. User Interface (UI) Design - the system has an interface.
5. Nutritional Recommendations - ensuring guidelines are met.
6. Decision Support - helping users make better choices.
7. Real-World Applications - they have a demo, indicating practical use.
8. A/B Test/User Survey - potential evaluation methods, though not explicit here but relevant for real-world apps.

Wait, the abstract mentions &#34;automatically complete a daily meal plan or can generate entire plans itself,&#34; which emphasizes automation and personalization. So maybe include Personalized Recommendations as another category.

Also, considering the aspect of data used for recommendations, perhaps Data-Driven Decisions is applicable.

Putting it all together, I think the categories should cover the recommendation system aspects, the health domain, personalization, interface design, nutritional guidelines, user behavior, real-world application, and evaluation methods. 

I&#39;ll make sure each category is relevant and that there are enough to enhance discoverability without overcrowding any single category.
&lt;/think&gt;
