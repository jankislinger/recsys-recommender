Title: Accelerating the Surrogate Retraining for Poisoning Attacks against Recommender Systems
Abstract:
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of recommender systems to data poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject carefully crafted fake user interactions into the training data to manipulate recommendations for target items.Current attack methods involve iterative retraining a surrogate recommender on the poisoned data with latest fake users to optimize the attack. However, this repetitive retraining is highly time-consuming, hindering the efficient assessment and optimization of fake users. To mitigate this computational bottleneck and develop a more effective attack in an affordable time, we analyze the retraining process and find that a change in the representation of one user/item will cause a cascading effect through the user-item interaction graph. Under theoretical guidance, we introduce Gradient Passing (GP),  a novel technique that explicitly passes gradients between interacted user-item pairs during backpropagation, thereby approximate the cascading effect and accelerating retraining. With just a single training step, GP can achieve effects comparable to multiple original steps. Under the same number of retraining epochs, GP enables a closer approximation of the surrogate recommender to the victim. This improved approximation provides better guidance for optimizing fake users, ultimately leading to enhanced data poisoning attacks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed GP.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. The goal is to make sure that each article is placed in appropriate categories so users can easily find it when navigating through the interface. 

First, let&#39;s look at the title: &#34;Accelerating the Surrogate Retraining for Poisoning Attacks against Recommender Systems.&#34; This immediately tells me the article is about data poisoning attacks on recommender systems and a method to accelerate retraining in this context.

The abstract gives more details. It mentions that current attack methods involve iterative retraining of a surrogate model, which is time-consuming. The authors propose Gradient Passing (GP) as a technique to approximate cascading effects during backpropagation, thus accelerating the process. They also mention experiments on real-world datasets showing efficiency and effectiveness.

So, breaking this down:

1. **Recommender Systems**: The article is about attacks against recommendation systems, so that&#39;s a primary category.
2. **Data Poisoning Attacks**: This is specifically about poisoning attacks, which manipulate recommendations by injecting fake data.
3. **Adversarial Machine Learning**: Since it involves attacking machine learning models (recommenders), this fits under adversarial techniques.
4. **Gradient Passing**: The new technique introduced should be a category on its own for discoverability.
5. **Surrogate Model Retraining**: This refers to the method used in attacks, which is an important aspect of their approach.
6. **User/Item Interaction Graphs**: The article discusses how changes propagate through these graphs, so this is relevant.
7. **Cascading Effects**: Another specific concept addressed in the methodology.
8. **Backpropagation Optimization**: The technique involves optimizing backpropagation steps, which is a key part of neural network training.

I should also consider other possible categories like &#34;Algorithm Efficiency&#34; since they&#39;re improving the speed of attacks, but maybe that&#39;s covered under &#34;Scalability.&#34; However, looking at the provided examples and the guidelines, I think sticking to more specific terms would be better for user navigation. 

Another thought: &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; because they tested on real datasets. That could help users interested in practical implementations.

I&#39;m also thinking about whether categories like &#34;Recommendation Algorithms&#34; or &#34;Attack Mitigation&#34; might apply here. The article isn&#39;t directly proposing a defense but an attack method, so maybe &#34;Attack Methods&#34; is more appropriate than &#34;Mitigation.&#34; However, given the list provided earlier, perhaps it&#39;s better to stick with the specific terms related to their contribution.

I should make sure each category is clear and user-friendly, avoiding overly technical jargon where possible. For example, instead of a very niche term, using broader categories that align with common search behaviors.

So compiling all this:

- Recommender Systems: Directly relevant as the target system.
- Data Poisoning Attacks: The specific type of attack discussed.
- Adversarial Machine Learning: The field within ML where attacks are studied.
- Gradient Passing: The novel technique introduced.
- Surrogate Model Retraining: A key method used in their approach.
- User/Item Interaction Graphs: Important for understanding the attack&#39;s mechanism.
- Cascading Effects: Describes how changes propagate, a specific concept here.
- Backpropagation Optimization: Relates to improving training efficiency.

I think these cover the main aspects without being too narrow or too broad. Each category should help users find this article if they&#39;re interested in any of those areas. I&#39;ll make sure there are at least 8 categories as per guidelines and avoid redundancy by choosing distinct terms.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task step by step. The article is about accelerating surrogate retraining for poisoning attacks against recommender systems. 

First, I&#39;ll start with the obvious categories related to recommendation systems since the topic directly deals with them. So that would be &#34;Recommender Systems.&#34;

Next, the article talks about data poisoning attacks. That&#39;s a clear indication of security concerns, so I&#39;ll add &#34;Security &amp; Privacy&#34; as another category.

The method mentioned involves surrogate models being retrained. Since they&#39;re using a substitute model to attack the actual system, &#34;Surrogate Models&#34; is definitely relevant here.

Gradient Passing (GP) is introduced as a new technique to speed up training. This sounds like an optimization strategy, so I&#39;ll include &#34;Optimization Techniques.&#34;

Looking at the domains where this could apply, recommender systems are part of machine learning applications. Therefore, &#34;Machine Learning Applications&#34; fits well.

The paper discusses methods for improving attack efficiency, which falls under attack techniques in security research. Hence, &#34;Attack Techniques&#34; should be another category.

They mention experiments on real-world datasets, indicating empirical validation. So, &#34;Empirical Validation&#34; is appropriate.

Lastly, the focus is on optimizing fake user interactions to poison the system, which relates specifically to poisoning attacks. Thus, &#34;Poisoning Attacks&#34; is a fitting category.

I made sure each category directly ties back to the article&#39;s content and themes without overcomplicating things. Each category should help users navigate and find related research efficiently.
&lt;/think&gt;
