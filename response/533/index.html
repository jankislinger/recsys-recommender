Title: Exploring Clustering of Bandits for Online Recommendation System
Abstract:
Cluster-of-bandit policy leverages contextual bandits in a collaborative filtering manner and aids personalized services in the online recommendation system (RecSys). When facing insufficient observations, the cluster-of-bandit policy could achieve more outstanding performance because of knowledge sharing. Cluster-of-bandit policy aims to maximize the cumulative feedback, e.g., clicks, from users. Nevertheless, in the way of their goal exist two kinds of uncertainties. First, cluster-of-bandit algorithms make recommendations according to their uncertain estimation of user interests. Second, cluster-of-bandit algorithms transfer relevant knowledge upon uncertain and noisy user clusters. Existing algorithms only consider the first one, while leaving the latter one untouched. To address the two challenges together, in this paper, we propose the ClexB policy for online RecSys. On the one hand, ClexB estimates user clustering more accurately and with less uncertainty via explorable-clustering. On the other hand, ClexB also exploits and explores user interests by sharing information within and among user clusters. In summary, ClexB explores knowledge transfer and further aids the inferences about user interests. Besides, we provide extensive empirical experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets and regret analysis, further consolidating the superiority of ClexB.

Alright, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about &#34;Exploring Clustering of Bandits for Online Recommendation System.&#34; Let me start by reading through the title and abstract to understand what it&#39;s about.

The title mentions clustering of bandits in online recommendation systems. From what I know, bandits usually refer to multi-armed bandit algorithms used in reinforcement learning for decision-making under uncertainty. Clustering might mean grouping similar users or items together to improve recommendations. So this article is likely discussing a method that combines these two concepts.

Looking at the abstract, they talk about cluster-of-bandit policies using contextual bandits in collaborative filtering. That makes sense because recommendation systems often use collaborative filtering to suggest items based on user behavior. The policy helps personalize services by sharing knowledge among users when there&#39;s insufficient data. 

The article mentions two uncertainties: estimating user interests and transferring knowledge between uncertain clusters. They propose a ClexB policy that addresses both by improving cluster accuracy and information sharing. They also did experiments with synthetic and real datasets, which shows it&#39;s practical.

Now, I need to assign categories based on this. Let me think about the key elements here:

1. **Multi-Armed Bandits**: Definitely, since bandits are central to their approach.
2. **Clustering**: They use clustering for grouping users or items.
3. **Recommendation Systems (RecSys)**: That&#39;s the main application area.
4. **Contextual Bandits**: A type of bandit algorithm that uses context, which they mention.
5. **Collaborative Filtering**: Used in recommendation systems to make predictions about user interests.
6. **Personalized Services**: The goal is personalization through recommendations.
7. **Uncertainty Handling**: They address uncertainties in both estimating user interests and transferring knowledge.
8. **User Clustering**: Specific type of clustering applied to users.
9. **Knowledge Transfer**: Sharing information between clusters to improve recommendations.
10. **Exploration vs Exploitation**: A common concept in bandits, deciding when to explore new options vs exploit known ones.
11. **Empirical Experiments**: They tested their approach with real and synthetic data.
12. **Algorithm Design**: The paper proposes a new policy (ClexB), so it&#39;s about designing algorithms.

I think these cover the main points. Each category should be relevant and help users find related articles easily. I also made sure to include both specific terms like &#34;Multi-Armed Bandits&#34; and broader areas like &#34;Recommendation Systems.&#34; This way, the categorization is balanced and useful for navigation.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

The title is &#34;Exploring Clustering of Bandits for Online Recommendation System.&#34; Right away, keywords like &#34;Clustering,&#34; &#34;Bandits,&#34; and &#34;Online Recommendation System&#34; stand out. 

Looking at the abstract, it mentions the use of a cluster-of-bandit policy in collaborative filtering for personalized services in RecSys. It talks about addressing uncertainties in user clustering and interest estimation to improve recommendation performance. The paper proposes ClexB policy, which enhances knowledge transfer and user interest inference.

Now, I&#39;ll identify the key themes and topics discussed:

1. **Bandits (Multi-Armed Bandits)**: Since the article specifically discusses bandit algorithms.
2. **Clustering**: The method uses clustering to improve recommendation systems.
3. **Recommendation Systems**: Clearly falls under this category as it&#39;s about online recommendations.
4. **Collaborative Filtering**: As mentioned in the abstract, it&#39;s a collaborative filtering approach.
5. **Personalized Services**: The goal is to aid personalized services through better recommendations.
6. **Uncertainty Handling**: The paper addresses uncertainties in both user clustering and interest estimation.
7. **Knowledge Sharing**: It talks about transferring knowledge within and among user clusters.

I should also consider other relevant categories that might not be explicitly mentioned but are implied by the content. For example, &#34;Algorithm Design&#34; as they propose a new policy (ClexB), which is an algorithmic contribution. Additionally, since it&#39;s focused on improving recommendation systems through better clustering and bandit strategies, &#34;Scalability&#34; could be another category if the approach is intended for large-scale applications.

Let me list these categories:

- Bandits
- Clustering
- Multi-Armed Bandits (since it&#39;s a type of bandit)
- Recommendation Systems
- Collaborative Filtering
- Personalized Recommendations
- Online recommendation systems
- Algorithm Design
- Uncertainty Handling

Wait, but I&#39;m supposed to limit the number. The user mentioned assigning at least 8-12 categories, but in this case, some might overlap or be too specific.

Let me ensure each category is distinct and relevant. Also, considering user-centric design, terms like &#34;Personalized Recommendations&#34; and &#34;Knowledge Sharing&#34; are important for users searching for those topics.

Wait, maybe &#34;Algorithm Design&#34; is too broad. The paper specifically discusses bandits and clustering within the recommendation system context. So perhaps it&#39;s better to focus on more specific categories related to recommendation systems and machine learning.

Let me think again:

1. **Bandits** (specific)
2. **Multi-Armed Bandits** (since it&#39;s a type of bandit, important distinction)
3. **Clustering**
4. **Recommendation Systems**
5. **Collaborative Filtering**
6. **Personalized Recommendations**
7. **Uncertainty Handling**
8. **Knowledge Sharing**

That gives me eight categories. Alternatively, I can add &#34;Algorithm Design&#34; and &#34;Online recommendation systems&#34; if necessary.

But the abstract mentions online recommendation systems explicitly, so that should be included. Also, considering scalability might be relevant if ClexB is designed for large datasets.

So finalizing:

- Bandits
- Multi-Armed Bandits
- Clustering
- Recommendation Systems
- Collaborative Filtering
- Personalized Recommendations
- Online recommendation systems
- Uncertainty Handling
- Knowledge Sharing

That&#39;s nine categories. I think this covers the main aspects of the article, ensuring discoverability and utility for users interested in bandit algorithms, clustering, recommendation systems, etc.
&lt;/think&gt;
