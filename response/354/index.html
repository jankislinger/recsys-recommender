Title: Quality-Aware Neural Complementary Item Recommendation
Abstract:
Complementary item recommendation finds products that go well with one another (e.g., a camera and a specific lens). While they are ubiquitous, the dimensions by which items go together can vary by both product and category, making it difficult to detect complementary items at scale. Moreover, in practice, user preferences for complementary items can be complex combinations of item quality and evidence of complementarity. Hence, we propose a new neural complementary recommender Encore that can jointly learn complementary item relationships and user preferences. Specifically, Encore (i) effectively combines and balances both stylistic and functional evidence of complementary items across item categories; (ii) naturally models item latent quality for complementary items through Bayesian inference of customer ratings; and (iii) builds a novel neural network model to learn the complex (non-linear) relationships between items for flexible and scalable complementary product recommendations. Through experiments over large Amazon datasets, we find that Encore effectively learns complementary item relationships, leading to an improvement in accuracy of 15.5% on average versus the next-best alternative.

Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about &#34;Quality-Aware Neural Complementary Item Recommendation.&#34; Let me start by understanding what the article is about.

The title mentions &#34;complementary item recommendation,&#34; which makes me think it&#39;s related to suggesting items that go well together, like a camera and its specific lens. The abstract confirms that they&#39;re working on finding products that complement each other at scale, which is a common problem in e-commerce. 

The authors propose a neural model called Encore. They mention three key aspects: combining stylistic and functional evidence of complementary items, modeling latent quality through Bayesian inference, and using a neural network to capture non-linear relationships between items. These points suggest that the model deals with both style (how items look together) and function (how they work together), which are important for accurate recommendations.

Looking at the evaluation, they tested on Amazon datasets and saw a 15.5% improvement in accuracy over existing methods. This shows real-world applicability and effectiveness, so categories related to experiments, applications, and improvements would be relevant.

I should also consider the broader themes like recommendation systems, neural networks, machine learning, Bayesian methods, and e-commerce since those are all key elements here. Additionally, aspects like item relationships, quality modeling, and scalability come up in the abstract, which are important for categorization.

Putting this together, I&#39;ll map these points to the categories provided earlier. The family of algorithm would include neural networks and Bayesian inference. The domain is clearly e-commerce. Specific recommendation aspects would be complementary items. Evaluation aspects like accuracy and experiments are covered, along with real-world applications through A/B testing or user surveys mentioned in the example.

I need to make sure each category is relevant but not too narrow or broad. Ensuring that Encore&#39;s focus on both quality and complementarity leads me to include those specific terms as well.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Quality-Aware Neural Complementary Item Recommendation.&#34; Let me read through the title and abstract carefully.

The article talks about complementary item recommendation, which means suggesting products that go well together, like a camera with a specific lens. The challenge is that items can vary by product and category, making it hard to detect these relationships at scale. Users might have complex preferences based on both item quality and how they complement each other.

The authors propose a new neural network model called Encore. This model aims to learn complementary item relationships and user preferences together. It does this in three ways: first, by combining stylistic and functional evidence across categories; second, by using Bayesian inference of customer ratings to model item latent quality; and third, by building a neural network to capture non-linear relationships for scalable recommendations.

The experiments show a 15.5% improvement in accuracy compared to the next-best method on large Amazon datasets.

Now, considering the categorization guidelines, I should assign at least 8-12 categories. Let me break down the key elements:

1. **Complementary Recommendation**: The main focus is on recommending complementary items.
2. **Neural Networks**: They use a neural network model, so that&#39;s relevant.
3. **Bayesian Inference**: This technique is used for modeling item quality.
4. **Customer Ratings**: The article mentions using customer ratings, which falls under this category.
5. **Scalability**: The solution aims to scale effectively, especially with large datasets like Amazon&#39;s.
6. **Item Quality**: This is a key aspect they model through Bayesian inference.
7. **User Preferences**: Understanding and modeling user preferences is central to the recommendation system.
8. **Latent Quality**: They talk about latent qualities of items inferred through customer ratings.
9. **Non-Linear Relationships**: The neural network captures these, which is important for accurate recommendations.

I think that covers most aspects without overlapping too much. I should make sure each category is clear and relevant. Let me double-check if there are any other possible categories but given the information provided, these seem to cover it adequately.
&lt;/think&gt;
