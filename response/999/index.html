        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: From Research to Production: Towards Scalable and Sustainable Neural Recommendation Models on Commodity CPU Hardware
Abstract:
In the last decade, large-scale deep learning has fundamentally transformed industrial recommendation systems. However, this revolutionary technology remains prohibitively expensive due to the need for costly and scarce specialized hardware, such as GPUs, to train and serve models. In this talk, we share our multi-year journey at ThirdAI in developing efficient neural recommendation models that can be trained and deployed on commodity CPU machines without the need for costly accelerators like GPUs. In particular, we discuss the limitations of the current GPU-based ecosystem in machine learning, why recommendation systems are amenable to the strengths of CPU devices, and present results from our efforts to translate years of academic research into a deployable system that fundamentally shifts the economics of training and operating large-scale machine learning models.

Okay, I need to categorize this article about scalable neural recommendation models on commodity CPUs. Let&#39;s start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;scalable&#34; and &#34;sustainable neural recommendation models&#34; using commodity CPU hardware. So scalability is a big point here. The abstract talks about how large-scale deep learning has transformed recommendation systems but is expensive because of GPUs. They&#39;ve developed efficient models for CPUs, which are cheaper and more accessible.

Looking at the key themes: it&#39;s about recommendation systems, so that&#39;s one category. It mentions neural models, so &#34;Neural Networks&#34; makes sense. Since they&#39;re focusing on commodity hardware like CPUs instead of GPUs, categories related to hardware optimization or cost-effectiveness might be relevant.

The abstract also discusses moving from research to production, so &#34;Production Systems&#34; is a good fit. They talk about large-scale machine learning, so that&#39;s another category. The journey involves efficient models, so &#34;Efficiency Optimization&#34; should be included. 

They mention translating academic research into deployable systems, which ties into &#34;Research to Practice.&#34; The focus on CPU instead of GPU points towards &#34;Hardware Optimization.&#34; It&#39;s also a real-world application with A/B testing or user surveys, so maybe not directly mentioned here but since they talk about deployment, &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; is appropriate.

Putting it all together, the categories should cover the main areas like recommendation systems, neural networks, production aspects, scalability, efficiency, and hardware optimization. Also including cost-effectiveness because they&#39;re aiming to reduce expenses by using CPUs.
&lt;/think&gt;
