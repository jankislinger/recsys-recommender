Title: Towards Robust Fairness-aware Recommendation
Abstract:
Due to the progressive advancement of trustworthy machine learning algorithms, fairness in recommender systems is attracting increasing attention and is often considered from the perspective of users. Conventional fairness-aware recommendation models make the assumption that user preferences remain the same between the training set and the testing set. However, this assumption is disagreed with reality, where user preference can shift in the testing set due to the natural spatial or temporal heterogeneity. It is concerning that conventional fairness-aware models may be unaware of such distribution shifts, leading to a sharp decline in the model performance. To address the distribution shift problem, we propose a robust fairness-aware recommendation framework based on Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) technique. In specific, we assign learnable weights for each sample to approximate the distributions that leads to the worst-case model performance, and then optimize the fairness-aware recommendation model to improve the worst-case performance in terms of both fairness and recommendation accuracy. By iteratively updating the weights and the model parameter, our framework can be robust to unseen testing sets. To ease the learning difficulty of DRO, we use a hard clustering technique to reduce the number of learnable sample weights. To optimize our framework in a full differentiable manner, we soften the above clustering strategy. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments based on four real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework. For benefiting the research community, we have released our project at https://anonyrobfair.github.io/.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article titled &#34;Towards Robust Fairness-aware Recommendation.&#34; The goal is to assign it to multiple relevant categories based on its content and themes. Let me go through the abstract again to understand what the article is about.

The abstract mentions that fairness in recommender systems is getting more attention, especially from a user perspective. They point out that traditional models assume user preferences don&#39;t change between training and testing sets, but this isn&#39;t always true because users can shift their preferences over time or space. The authors propose using Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) to handle these distribution shifts, making the recommendation system more robust.

So, breaking down the key points:

1. **Fairness-aware Recommendation**: This is a clear category since the paper focuses on ensuring fairness in recommendations.
2. **Distribution Shift Handling**: They address how user preferences can change between training and testing phases.
3. **Robust Optimization Techniques**: Specifically using DRO to handle worst-case scenarios.
4. **Machine Learning in Recommenders**: The study falls under machine learning techniques applied to recommendation systems.
5. **Algorithm Family**: They use an optimization framework, so this would be a category related to that family of algorithms.

Looking at the example categories provided earlier, I should map these points into existing or new categories. Let me think about how each point translates:

- **Fairness-aware Recommendation**: This fits directly as a specific recommendation aspect.
- **Distribution Shift Handling**: There&#39;s no exact category mentioned before, but &#34;Distribution Robustness&#34; might cover it.
- **Robust Optimization Techniques**: The framework uses DRO, which is an optimization method, so &#34;Robust Optimization&#34; would be appropriate.
- **Machine Learning in Recommenders**: This aligns with machine learning applications in recommendation systems.
- **Algorithm Family (Optimization Framework)**: This would be a broader category under which their specific technique falls.

I should also consider other categories from the examples to ensure comprehensive coverage:

- **Trustworthy Machine Learning**: The paper discusses trustworthy aspects through fairness and robustness.
- **Recommendation Systems**: A general category that encompasses all recommendation-related topics.
- **Evaluation Aspects (Robustness, Fairness)**: They evaluate their model&#39;s performance under distribution shifts, so this is relevant.

I need to make sure each article is placed in at least 8-12 categories without overcrowding any. The user-centric design suggests using clear labels that users would likely search for.

Potential categories:

1. **Fairness-aware Recommendation**
2. **Distribution Robustness**
3. **Robust Optimization Techniques**
4. **Machine Learning Applications in Recommenders**
5. **Optimization Frameworks (Algorithm Family)**
6. **Trustworthy Machine Learning**
7. **Recommendation Systems**

Wait, that&#39;s seven categories. Maybe I missed some. Let me think again.

- They use DRO, which is a specific technique under optimization.
- They address distribution shifts, so &#34;Distribution Shift Handling&#34; could be another category.
- The paper focuses on improving recommendation accuracy and fairness, so aspects like &#34;Recommendation Accuracy&#34; might be relevant.

Putting it all together:

1. **Fairness-aware Recommendation**
2. **Distribution Robustness**
3. **Robust Optimization Techniques**
4. **Machine Learning Applications in Recommenders**
5. **Optimization Frameworks (Algorithm Family)**
6. **Trustworthy Machine Learning**
7. **Recommendation Systems**
8. **Distribution Shift Handling**

That&#39;s eight categories, which fits the guideline of 8-12. I think this covers all the key aspects from the abstract and aligns with user needs by providing clear, relevant tags.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, I need to categorize this article titled &#34;Towards Robust Fairness-aware Recommendation.&#34; The abstract talks about fairness in recommender systems and how existing models assume user preferences don&#39;t change between training and testing. But in reality, user preferences can shift because of spatial or temporal factors, leading to model performance issues. 

The proposed solution is a robust framework using Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). They assign learnable weights to samples to approximate worst-case distributions and optimize the model for better fairness and accuracy. Clustering techniques are used to reduce complexity, and they demonstrate this with four datasets.

So, starting with the obvious categories: Fairness-aware recommendation is the main focus. Next, DRO is a key technique here, so that&#39;s another category. Since the problem deals with distribution shifts, Distribution Shift is relevant.

The article mentions robust models, so Robust Models fits. It discusses fairness metrics and improving both fairness and accuracy, so both Fairness Metrics and Recommendation Accuracy are applicable.

Temporal aspects are involved because user preferences can change over time, hence Temporal Aspects. Similarly, Spatial Aspects might be considered if location affects recommendations, but the abstract doesn&#39;t specify spatial factors explicitly beyond mentioning it as a cause of preference shifts. However, since it&#39;s mentioned, maybe include Spatial Aspects.

Real-world applications are covered through experiments on datasets, so Real-World Applications is appropriate. Evaluation Metrics could also be a category because they test effectiveness empirically.

I should ensure the categories are clear and cover all aspects without being too specific or too broad. Let me list them: Fairness-aware recommendation, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), Distribution Shift, Robust Models, Fairness Metrics, Recommendation Accuracy, Temporal Aspects, Spatial Aspects, Real-World Applications, Evaluation Metrics.

Wait, does the abstract mention evaluation metrics beyond empirical experiments? It says they conduct extensive experiments to verify effectiveness. So Evaluation Metrics might be a good fit as it relates to how they measure performance.

I think that&#39;s comprehensive enough without overcomplicating.
&lt;/think&gt;

Fairness-aware recommendation, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), Distribution Shift, Robust Models, Fairness Metrics, Recommendation Accuracy, Temporal Aspects, Spatial Aspects, Real-World Applications, Evaluation Metrics.</code></pre>
