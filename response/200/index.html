        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Are You Influenced by Others When Rating? Improve Rating Prediction by Conformity Modeling
Abstract:
Conformity has a strong influence to user behaviors, even in online environment. When surfing online, users are usually flooded with others’ opinions. These opinions implicitly contribute to the user’s ongoing behaviors. However, there is no research work modeling online conformity yet. In this paper, we model user’s conformity in online rating sites. We conduct analysis using real data to show the existence and strength of conformity in these scenarios. We propose a matrix-factorization-based conformity modeling technique to improve the accuracy of rating prediction. Experiments show that our model outperforms existing works significantly (with a relative improvement of 11.72% on RMSE). Therefore, we draw the conclusion that conformity modeling is important for understanding user behaviors and can contribute to further improve the online recommender systems.

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task step by step. I&#39;m looking at an article titled &#34;Are You Influenced by Others When Rating? Improve Rating Prediction by Conformity Modeling.&#34; The abstract discusses how conformity affects user behavior in online rating sites and proposes a matrix factorization-based technique to improve prediction accuracy.

First, the core theme is about user behavior influenced by others, specifically through ratings. So categories like User Behavior and Social Influence come to mind. Since they&#39;re talking about modeling this behavior for recommendations, Collaborative Filtering fits here because it&#39;s a common recommendation method that considers user interactions.

The article uses matrix factorization as their technique, which falls under the family of algorithms, so I&#39;ll add Matrix Factorization. The domain is online rating sites, which relates to recommender systems, so Recommender Systems is another category.

They mention improving rating prediction accuracy, so Rating Prediction should be included. The study&#39;s application is in recommendation, making Recommendation a relevant category.

The aspect of evaluation here involves understanding user behavior beyond just accuracy metrics; they&#39;re looking at how social factors influence ratings. So Beyond Accuracy makes sense as it highlights the broader impact of their model.

They conducted experiments with real data and showed significant improvement, which means Real World Application is applicable because they applied their model in a practical setting.

Additionally, since they focus on understanding user behaviors influenced by others, User Behavior Modeling is another fitting category.

I should make sure each category is relevant without overlapping too much. They didn&#39;t mention anything about cold start or diversity, so those aren&#39;t necessary here. I think this covers the main points from the abstract and aligns with user-centric design for discoverability.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about improving rating prediction by modeling user conformity in online environments. The title is &#34;Are You Influenced by Others When Rating? Improve Rating Prediction by Conformity Modeling.&#34; 

First, I&#39;ll look at the abstract to understand what it&#39;s about. It talks about how users&#39; behaviors are influenced by others&#39; opinions when rating items online, like on rating sites. They mention that there hasn&#39;t been much research on modeling this conformity in an online setting. So, they propose a matrix-factorization-based technique to model user conformity and improve the accuracy of rating predictions. Their experiments show significant improvements in RMSE compared to existing methods.

Now, I need to assign categories based on the guidelines provided. The article is related to recommendation systems because it&#39;s about improving rating prediction, which directly impacts how recommendations are made. Since they used matrix factorization as their technique, that should be a category too. 

The study focuses on user behavior influenced by others, so user influence and social dynamics in online environments are key themes here. That leads me to think &#34;User Influence&#34; is an appropriate category. They also specifically looked at conformity modeling, which is the core of their work, so that&#39;s another clear category.

Looking deeper into recommendation systems aspects, this article contributes to method improvements because they&#39;re introducing a new technique based on matrix factorization tailored for conformity. So, &#34;Method Improvement&#34; makes sense as a category.

They evaluated their model using RMSE, which falls under evaluation metrics in recommendation systems. Therefore, including &#34;Evaluation Metrics&#34; is important. The fact that the study looks at real data and real-world applications suggests it&#39;s application-oriented, so &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; should be another category.

Since the focus is on user behavior and how others&#39; opinions affect ratings, this ties into the broader field of behavioral analysis in recommendation systems, hence &#34;Behavioral Analysis.&#34;

Additionally, since they&#39;re enhancing the accuracy of rating prediction, which impacts how recommendations are made more accurately, &#34;Accuracy Improvement&#34; is a relevant category. They also touch upon the aspect of diversity and beyond just RMSE metrics, so including &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; as an evaluation aspect would be useful.

Finally, matrix factorization being their core technique means it&#39;s a key part of this study in the recommendation space, reinforcing that &#34;Matrix Factorization&#34; is a primary category.

I should ensure I&#39;m covering all relevant angles without creating too narrow categories. It&#39;s important to balance between broad and specific terms so users can easily find related content.
&lt;/think&gt;
