Title: Modeling the Assimilation-Contrast Effects in Online Product Rating Systems: Debiasing and Recommendations
Abstract:
The unbiasedness of online product ratings, an important property to ensure that users’ ratings indeed reflect their true evaluations to products, is vital both in shaping consumer purchase decisions and providing reliable recommendations. Recent experimental studies showed that distortions from historical ratings would ruin the unbiasedness of subsequent ratings. How to “discover” the distortions from historical ratings in each single rating (or at the micro-level), and perform the “de-biasing operations” in real rating systems are the main objectives of this work. Using 42 million real customer ratings, we first show that users either “assimilate” or “contrast” to historical ratings under different scenarios: users conform to historical ratings if historical ratings are not far from the product quality (assimilation), while users deviate from historical ratings if they are significantly different from the product quality (contrast). This phenomenon can be explained by the well-known psychological argument: the “Assimilate-Contrast” theory. However, none of the existing works on modeling historical ratings’ influence have taken this into account, and this motivates us to propose the Historical Influence Aware Latent Factor Model (HIALF), the first model for real rating systems to capture and mitigate historical distortions in each single rating. HIALF also allows us to study the influence patterns of historical ratings from a modeling perspective, and it perfectly matches the assimilation and contrast effects we previously observed. Also, HIALF achieves significant improvements in predicting subsequent ratings, and accurately predicts the relationships revealed in previous empirical measurements on real ratings. Finally, we show that HIALF can contribute to better recommendations by decoupling users’ real preference from distorted ratings, and reveal the intrinsic product quality for wiser consumer purchase decisions.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on the guidelines provided. Let&#39;s start by analyzing the title and abstract.

The title is &#34;Modeling the Assimilation-Contrast Effects in Online Product Rating Systems: Debiasing and Recommendations.&#34; This suggests it deals with how user ratings are influenced by historical data, specifically through psychological effects like assimilation and contrast. The focus seems to be on improving recommendation systems by addressing biases in ratings.

Looking at the abstract, the article discusses the unbiasedness of online product ratings and how distortions from historical ratings affect subsequent ones. It uses a large dataset (42 million ratings) to demonstrate that users either conform or deviate based on previous ratings, which relates to the Assimilate-Contrast theory in psychology. The authors propose a model called HIALF to capture and mitigate these distortions, improving prediction accuracy and recommendation quality.

Now, I&#39;ll map this to the example categories provided:

1. **Family of Algorithm**: The article introduces the Historical Influence Aware Latent Factor Model (HIALF), which is a type of latent factor model. So that&#39;s one category.
   
2. **Domain of the Problem**: This is about online product ratings and recommendations, so domains include Online Product Ratings, E-commerce, and Consumer Behavior.

3. **Recommendation Space Specifics**: It deals with debiasing in recommendation systems and understanding user behavior dynamics, so categories like Recommendation Systems, Debiasing Methods, User Behavior Dynamics fit here.

4. **Evaluation Aspects**: The model is evaluated based on predicting subsequent ratings accurately, so Evaluation of Recommendations and Prediction Accuracy are relevant.

5. **Psychological Factors**: The article references the Assimilate-Contrast theory from psychology, making Psychological Models a suitable category.

6. **Real-World Applications**: They mention A/B testing and user surveys as potential applications for validating their model, though these aren&#39;t explicitly detailed here but implied in the context of real-world implementation.

7. **Data-Specific Aspects**: The use of 42 million ratings suggests handling large datasets, so Large Datasets is another category.

8. **Algorithmic Enhancements**: The article focuses on improving recommendation algorithms by addressing biases, so Algorithmic Improvements fits as well.

I should ensure that each category is distinct and covers different aspects without overlap. Also, I need to assign at least 8-12 categories as per guidelines. Let me compile the list now.
&lt;/think&gt;

Latent Factor Models, Online Product Ratings, Recommendation Systems, Debiasing Methods, Psychological Models, Assimilation-Contrast Effects, E-commerce, Consumer Behavior, User Behavior Dynamics, Evaluation of Recommendations, Prediction Accuracy, Large Datasets, Algorithmic Improvements</code></pre>

Okay, I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. The title mentions &#34;Modeling the Assimilation-Contrast Effects in Online Product Rating Systems: Debiasing and Recommendations.&#34; So, it&#39;s dealing with online ratings, specifically looking at how historical ratings affect current ones through assimilation and contrast.

First, I&#39;ll look for family of algorithms mentioned or implied. The abstract talks about proposing a new model called HIALF, which stands for Historical Influence Aware Latent Factor Model. That sounds like a type of latent factor model, so that&#39;s one category: Latent Factor Models.

Next, the domain is online product ratings, which falls under e-commerce. So I should include E-Commerce as a category.

The article deals with rating systems and debiasing them to get more accurate recommendations. Since it&#39;s about improving recommendation accuracy by considering historical biases, Recommendation Systems is another key category.

Assimilation and contrast effects are psychological phenomena influencing user ratings. This ties into the psychology behind user behavior, so User Behavior Psychology is relevant here.

The model HIALF aims to mitigate distortions from historical ratings, which relates to debiasing techniques in recommendation systems. So Debiasing Methods should be another category.

The study uses a large dataset of 42 million ratings, indicating that it&#39;s empirical and based on real-world data. Empirical Studies is appropriate here.

The article discusses how user ratings are influenced by historical data, which relates to the temporal aspects of ratings—how past actions affect future ones. Temporal Dynamics in Ratings could be another category.

Since the focus is on making recommendations wiser for consumer decisions, Consumer Behavior is a fitting category.

Lastly, the paper addresses issues with rating systems and their impact on recommendation accuracy, so it&#39;s definitely related to Rating Systems themselves.

I think I&#39;ve covered all the main points. Now, let me list them out as categories.
&lt;/think&gt;

Latent Factor Models, E-Commerce, Recommendation Systems, User Behavior Psychology, Debiasing Methods, Empirical Studies, Temporal Dynamics in Ratings, Consumer Behavior, Rating Systems</code></pre>
