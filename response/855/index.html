Title: Contrastive Learning with Frequency-Domain Interest Trends for Sequential Recommendation
Abstract:
Recently, contrastive learning for sequential recommendation has demonstrated its powerful ability to learn high-quality user representations. However, constructing augmented samples in the time domain poses challenges due to various reasons, such as fast-evolving trends, interest shifts, and system factors. Furthermore, the F-principle indicates that deep learning preferentially fits the low-frequency part, resulting in poor performance on high-frequency tasks. The complexity of time series and the low-frequency preference limit the utility of sequence encoders. To address these challenges, we need to construct augmented samples from the frequency domain, thus improving the ability to accommodate events of different frequency sizes. To this end, we propose a novel Contrastive Learning with Frequency-Domain Interest Trends for Sequential Recommendation (CFIT4SRec). We treat the embedding representations of historical interactions as “images” and introduce the second-order Fourier transform to construct augmented samples. The components of different frequency sizes reflect the interest trends between attributes and their surroundings in the hidden space. We introduce three data augmentation operations to accommodate events of different frequency sizes: low-pass augmentation, high-pass augmentation, and band-stop augmentation. Extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of CFIT4SRec over the state-of-the-art baselines. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/zhangyichi1Z/CFIT4SRec.

Okay, I need to assign categories to this research article titled &#34;Contrastive Learning with Frequency-Domain Interest Trends for Sequential Recommendation.&#34; Let me start by understanding the key points from the title and abstract.

The article discusses contrastive learning in the context of sequential recommendation systems. It introduces a method called CFIT4SRec which uses frequency-domain techniques, specifically Fourier transforms, to create augmented samples. The main challenge addressed is the limitations of time-domain approaches due to fast-evolving trends and interest shifts. They apply data augmentation through low-pass, high-pass, and band-stop filtering.

Now, considering the guidelines, I need to assign each article to 8-12 categories that are both specific and broad enough for user-friendly navigation. Let me break down the potential categories:

1. **Contrastive Learning**: The core method used here is contrastive learning, so this should be a primary category.
2. **Sequential Recommendation**: The application area is sequential recommendation systems.
3. **Frequency-Domain Analysis**: They use Fourier transforms, which are frequency-domain techniques.
4. **Data Augmentation**: The method involves creating augmented samples through filtering.
5. **User Representation Learning**: The focus on learning high-quality user representations fits here.
6. **Recommendation Algorithms**: It&#39;s about improving recommendation systems&#39; performance.
7. **Time Series Analysis**: They deal with sequential data, which relates to time series.
8. **Deep Learning**: The approach uses deep learning models, as mentioned in the F-principle.
9. **Signal Processing Techniques**: Using Fourier transforms and filtering techniques from signal processing.
10. **Interest Evolution Modeling**: Addresses interest shifts and evolving trends over time.

I should check if these categories are clear and cover both specific and broader aspects without being too narrow or overlapping. Each category seems distinct enough, providing a balanced distribution for users to navigate through topics they&#39;re interested in, whether it&#39;s the specific method (Contrastive Learning) or broader applications (Recommendation Algorithms). This categorization aligns with user-centric design by reflecting common search behaviors and ensuring each category is sufficiently populated without overcrowding.

We treat the embedding representations of historical interactions as “images” and introduce the second-order Fourier transform to construct augmented samples. The components of different frequency sizes reflect the interest trends between attributes and their surroundings in the hidden space.

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about contrastive learning with frequency-domain interest trends for sequential recommendation. Let&#39;s break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: &#34;Contrastive Learning with Frequency-Domain Interest Trends for Sequential Recommendation.&#34; That immediately tells me it&#39;s related to recommendation systems and uses contrastive learning. The mention of frequency-domain suggests some signal processing or time series analysis is involved.

The abstract starts by talking about how contrastive learning has been effective in sequential recommendations but faces challenges when dealing with time domain issues like fast-evolving trends and interest shifts. So, the core problem seems to be improving recommendation systems using better data augmentation methods.

It then mentions the F-principle, which relates to deep learning&#39;s preference for low-frequency parts of data, leading to poor performance on high-frequency tasks. This suggests that traditional approaches might not handle varying frequencies well in sequential data, so the authors propose a solution involving frequency-domain analysis.

The proposed method is called CFIT4SRec. They treat user interaction embeddings as images and use a second-order Fourier transform for data augmentation. The three types of augmentations they introduce—low-pass, high-pass, and band-stop—are likely designed to handle different frequencies in the data, which ties back to addressing the F-principle issue.

The experiments were done on four benchmark datasets, showing their method outperforms existing baselines. This indicates it&#39;s a solid contribution to the field of recommendation systems.

Now, considering the categories from the guidelines:

1. **Family of Algorithm**: Contrastive Learning is definitely one. The use of Fourier transforms and sequence encoders also fit here.
2. **Domain/Problem Type**: Sequential Recommendation is clear here since the focus is on recommendations based on user sequences.
3. **Specific Recommendation Aspects**: Frequency-Domain Analysis stands out because it&#39;s a unique approach within recommendation systems.
4. **Evaluation Aspects**: The paper introduces novel data augmentation techniques, which is a specific method to improve models.
5. **Real-World Application**: While the abstract mentions public datasets and implementation code, there’s no explicit mention of A/B testing or user surveys, so maybe not here.
6. **Other Relevant Categories**: Time Series Analysis makes sense because they&#39;re dealing with sequential data over time. Deep Learning is involved as well since it&#39;s a common method in recommendation systems.

I need to ensure each article goes into 8-12 categories without overcrowding any. Also, the labels should be clear and user-friendly. Looking at possible overlaps: Frequency-Domain Analysis might not be a standard category yet, but it accurately describes their approach. Time Series is broader but relevant. Sequential Recommendation covers the domain aspect.

I think sticking with the categories that directly relate to the methods used (Contrastive Learning, Fourier Transform, Sequence Encoders) and the problem addressed (Sequential Recommendation, Frequency-Domain Analysis). Also, since they discuss data augmentation in a novel way, that&#39;s another category. Time Series Analysis is a good fit for the sequential nature of the data.

I should avoid making categories too specific if they might not be useful for users, but since these are all technical aspects of the paper, it&#39;s better to include them for discoverability.
&lt;/think&gt;
