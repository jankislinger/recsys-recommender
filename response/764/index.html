Title: Effective and Efficient Training for Sequential Recommendation using Recency Sampling
Abstract:
Many modern sequential recommender systems use deep neural networks, which can effectively estimate the relevance of items but require a lot of time to train. Slow training increases expenses, hinders product development timescales and prevents the model from being regularly updated to adapt to changing user preferences. Training such sequential models involves appropriately sampling past user interactions to create a realistic training objective. The existing training objectives have limitations. For instance, next item prediction never uses the beginning of the sequence as a learning target, thereby potentially discarding valuable data. On the other hand, the item masking used by BERT4Rec is only weakly related to the goal of the sequential recommendation; therefore, it requires much more time to obtain an effective model. Hence, we propose a novel Recency-based Sampling of Sequences training objective that addresses both limitations. We apply our method to various recent and state-of-the-art model architectures – such as GRU4Rec, Caser, and SASRec. We show that the models enhanced with our method can achieve performances exceeding or very close to state-of-the-art BERT4Rec, but with much less training time.

Alright, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about training methods for sequential recommendations. The title mentions &#34;Effective and Efficient Training&#34; which makes me think it&#39;s related to optimization in the recommendation process. The abstract talks about deep neural networks used in sequential recommenders and how their training is time-consuming.

First, I&#39;ll look at the key points from the abstract. They mention that using deep models like GRU4Rec, Caser, and SASRec can be slow to train, which affects costs and development times. So this relates to efficiency and scalability issues in recommendation systems.

They propose a new method called Recency- based Sampling of Sequences. This suggests it&#39;s an algorithm improvement or a training technique specific to recommendation systems. I should consider categories related to algorithms like &#34;Training Techniques&#34; or &#34;Efficiency.&#34;

The problem domain is sequential recommendations, so that&#39;s a clear category. They compare their approach to existing methods like next-item prediction and BERT4Rec, which are specific techniques in the recommendation space.

Looking at aspects of evaluation, they focus on reducing training time while maintaining performance. This ties into model scalability and effectiveness. The fact that their method reduces training time without sacrificing much performance points to optimization and efficiency.

They also discuss real-world applications since efficient models can be updated more frequently to adapt to user preferences, which is a practical concern for deploying recommendation systems.

Other relevant categories might include the specific problem of handling sequential data or temporal aspects in recommendations. The use of different model architectures like GRU4Rec suggests it&#39;s applicable across various methods, so &#34;Model Architecture&#34; could be another category.

Additionally, since they&#39;re enhancing existing models with their sampling method, that falls under algorithm improvements. The focus on efficient training also touches on optimization techniques and the practical aspects of implementing such models in real-world systems.

Putting this all together, I need to map these points into categories from the examples given. So, the categories should include the domain (Sequential Recommendations), algorithms and techniques they&#39;re improving or using (Training Techniques, Recency Sampling, Model Architecture), evaluation aspects like Efficiency and Scalability, as well as broader concepts like Optimization and Real-World Applications.

I also need to ensure that each article is placed in multiple relevant categories without overcrowding any single category. Since the focus is on training methods and efficiency, those should be prominent categories.

Okay, I&#39;m looking at this article titled &#34;Effective and Efficient Training for Sequential Recommendation using Recency Sampling.&#34; The abstract talks about improving training methods for sequential recommendation systems, which use deep neural networks. These models are effective but take a lot of time to train, which is costly and slows down product development.

The main issue addressed here is the training efficiency of these models. They mention that existing methods like next item prediction and BERT4Rec have their limitations. The authors propose a new method called Recency-based Sampling of Sequences (ReSS) to overcome these issues. They apply this method to various architectures such as GRU4Rec, Caser, and SASRec, showing improved performance with less training time.

So, categorizing this article: It&#39;s about sequential recommendation systems, so that&#39;s one category. The focus is on training efficiency, which relates to scalability since efficient methods allow for faster model updates and potentially larger scale applications. They&#39;re talking about deep learning models, so that&#39;s another category. The problem domain here is recommendation systems in general, but specifically the training aspect.

They also mention aspects of machine learning like sampling techniques (ReSS) and evaluation metrics where efficiency plays a role. Additionally, since they discuss real-world applications by comparing their method to existing ones used in practice, there&#39;s an aspect related to real-world applications or deployment considerations.

I should make sure each category is relevant but not too broad or narrow. Also, considering the user-centric design, categories like Scalability and Deep Learning are likely important for users looking into performance improvements and efficient solutions.
