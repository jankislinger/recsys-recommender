Title: Improving One-class Recommendation with Multi-tasking on Various Preference Intensities
Abstract:
In the one-class recommendation problem, it’s required to make recommendations basing on users’ implicit feedback, which is inferred from their action and inaction. Existing works obtain representations of users and items by encoding positive and negative interactions observed from training data. However, these efforts assume that all positive signals from implicit feedback reflect a fixed preference intensity, which is not realistic. Consequently, representations learned with these methods usually fail to capture informative entity features that reflect various preference intensities.
In this paper, we propose a multi-tasking framework taking various preference intensities of each signal from implicit feedback into consideration. Representations of entities are required to satisfy the objective of each subtask simultaneously, making them more robust and generalizable. Furthermore, we incorporate attentive graph convolutional layers to explore high-order relationships in the user-item bipartite graph and dynamically capture the latent tendencies of users toward the items they interact with. Experimental results show that our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on three large-scale real-world benchmark datasets.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories as per the user&#39;s instructions. Let me start by understanding the content of the article.

The title is &#34;Improving One-class Recommendation with Multi-tasking on Various Preference Intensities.&#34; The abstract discusses one-class recommendation problems, which rely on implicit feedback inferred from user actions and inactions. It mentions that existing methods treat all positive signals as having a fixed preference intensity, which isn&#39;t realistic. The authors propose a multi-tasking framework to consider varying intensities, enhancing the robustness and generalizability of learned representations. They also use attentive graph convolutional layers to explore high-order relationships in user-item interactions. Their experiments show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Now, I&#39;ll break down the key elements:

1. **Recommendation Systems**: The article is about improving recommendation systems, specifically one-class recommendations which rely on implicit feedback.

2. **Implicit Feedback**: This is a core aspect as the method deals with user actions and inactions to infer preferences.

3. **Multi-task Learning**: They use multi-tasking to handle various preference intensities, which is an important technique in machine learning.

4. **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)**: The paper incorporates attentive GCN layers, indicating its focus on graph-based methods for recommendations.

5. **User-Item Bipartite Graphs**: This refers to the structure used in recommendation systems where users and items form a bipartite graph with interactions as edges.

6. **Preference Intensity Modeling**: The article addresses the issue of varying preference intensities, which is crucial for accurate recommendations.

7. **Performance Evaluation**: They mention experiments on real-world datasets, showing their method&#39;s superior performance compared to existing methods.

8. **Scalability and Generalizability**: Their approach improves robustness and generalization, making it suitable for large-scale systems.

Considering the categories provided in the guidelines:

- Family of algorithms: Multi-tasking, Graph Convolutional Networks
- Domain: Not specific here; perhaps not applicable.
- Specific recommendation aspects: One-class Recommendation, Implicit Feedback
- Evaluation aspects: Performance on real-world datasets (but this might fall under a broader category)
- Real-world applications: The experiments are on real-world datasets but there&#39;s no mention of actual deployment, so maybe A/B Testing or User Survey isn&#39;t directly applicable here.

Other relevant categories could include:

- Representation Learning: As they&#39;re working on better entity representations.
- Preference Modeling: Since they focus on varying intensities.
- High-order Relationships: From the use of GCNs to explore these in user-item graphs.

Putting it all together, I need at least 8-12 categories. Let me list them:

One-class Recommendation, Implicit Feedback, Multi-task Learning, Graph Convolutional Networks, User-Item Bipartite Graphs, Preference Intensity Modeling, Representation Learning, High-order Relationships, Performance Evaluation, Scalability.

Wait, the original output had 10 categories. Maybe I can adjust to include more specific ones or ensure each is relevant.
&lt;/think&gt;

One-class Recommendation, Implicit Feedback, Multi-task Learning, Graph Convolutional Networks, User-Item Bipartite Graphs, Preference Intensity Modeling, Representation Learning, High-order Relationships, Performance Evaluation, Scalability</code></pre>

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories. The title is &#34;Improving One-class Recommendation with Multi-tasking on Various Preference Intensities.&#34; Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.

The paper discusses the one-class recommendation problem, which deals with implicit feedback—like user actions and inactions. They mention that existing methods use both positive and negative interactions but assume a fixed preference intensity, which isn&#39;t realistic. Their solution is a multi-tasking framework that considers various preference intensities from implicit feedback. They also use attentive graph convolutional layers to capture high-order relationships in the user-item bipartite graph.

So, first, I should identify the main themes and aspects of this paper. One-class recommendation is a specific area within recommendation systems. The focus here is on handling implicit feedback, which is common in many real-world applications like movie recommendations or e-commerce. They propose a multi-tasking framework, which suggests they&#39;re dealing with multiple related tasks to improve model performance.

Another key point is the use of graph convolutional layers and attention mechanisms, indicating that their approach leverages graph-based methods and attention to better capture user-item interactions. This ties into aspects like scalability and evaluation metrics since they mention experimental results showing improved performance over state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Looking at the example categories provided earlier: Family of algorithm (like Matrix Factorization or Multi-Armed Bandits), Domain of the problem (e.g., Movies, Healthcare), Specific recommendation aspects (Cold Start), Evaluation aspects (Diversity of Recommendations), and real-world applications like A/B testing.

Now, mapping this to the paper:

1. **One-class Recommendation**: This is the core focus, so it&#39;s a must.
2. **Implicit Feedback**: Since they deal with user actions and inactions, this category fits.
3. **Multi-tasking Learning**: Their framework involves multiple subtasks, which falls under multi-tasking.
4. **Graph-based Methods**: They use graph convolutional layers, so this is relevant.
5. **Attention Mechanisms**: The paper mentions attentive layers, so attention mechanisms are applicable.
6. **Recommendation Systems**: General category since it&#39;s a recommendation paper.
7. **Preference Intensity**: The paper specifically addresses varying intensities, making this a key category.

I should make sure each category is clear and descriptive. Also, considering the guidelines, I need at least 8 categories, but from the analysis, I have six so far. Perhaps I can add more based on other aspects like scalability or evaluation metrics mentioned in the abstract.

Wait, the paper talks about &#34;high-order relationships&#34; and improved performance over benchmarks. Maybe something related to evaluation metrics? They mention beyond accuracy, perhaps, as they show large margin improvements. Also, scalable methods might be involved if their approach handles large datasets efficiently.

Let me think again:

- **Scalability**: Since they use large-scale benchmark datasets, scalability is relevant.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: They discuss performance in terms of better results than state-of-the-art, so evaluation aspects like beyond accuracy could fit.
- **Recommendation Systems**: General category.
- **Preference Intensity**: Specific to their approach.

That brings the count to eight categories: One-class Recommendation, Implicit Feedback, Multi-tasking Learning, Graph-based Methods, Attention Mechanisms, Scalability, Evaluation (Beyond Accuracy), and Preference Intensity.

I should ensure each category is distinct and covers different aspects without overlap. This categorization should help users navigate based on their interests, whether it&#39;s the method used (multi-tasking, graph-based) or the problem aspect (implicit feedback, scalability).
&lt;/think&gt;

One-class Recommendation, Implicit Feedback, Multi-tasking Learning, Graph-based Methods, Attention Mechanisms, Scalability, Evaluation (Beyond Accuracy), Preference Intensity.</code></pre>
