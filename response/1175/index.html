        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Short-form Video Needs Long-term Interests: An Industrial Solution for Serving Large User Sequence Models
Abstract:
Sequential models are invaluable for powering personalized recommendation systems. In the context of short-form video (SFV) feeds, where user behavior history is typically longer, there’s a need for a system to handle users’ long-term interests. However, deploying large sequence models to extensive web-scale applications faces challenges due to high serving cost. To address this, we propose an industrial framework designed for efficiently serving large user sequence models. Specifically, the proposed infrastructure decouples the serving of user sequence model and the main recommendation model, with user sequence model served offline (in an asynchronous manner) with periodical refresh. The proposed infrastructure is also model-agnostic; thus, it can be used to support any types of user sequence models (even LLMs) with controllable costs. Empirical results show that large user models deployed with our framework significantly and consistently enhances the quality of the main recommendation model, with minimal serving costs increase.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me read through them carefully.

The title is &#34;Short-form Video Needs Long-term Interests: An Industrial Solution for Serving Large User Sequence Models.&#34; The abstract talks about sequential models being important for personalized recommendations in short-form video feeds. They mention that user behavior history here is usually longer, so there&#39;s a need to handle long-term interests. But deploying large sequence models at web scale has high serving costs.

They propose an industrial framework to efficiently serve these models by decoupling the user sequence model from the main recommendation model and serving it offline asynchronously with periodic refreshes. The infrastructure is model-agnostic, supporting any type of user sequence models, including LLMs, while keeping costs controllable. Their results show that using their framework improves recommendation quality without much increase in serving costs.

Now, I need to figure out which categories this article fits into. Let me go through the guidelines and examples provided.

First, looking at the family of algorithms: they mention user sequence models and even LLMs. So &#34;User Sequence Models&#34; seems relevant, maybe also &#34;Large Language Models (LLMs)&#34; as a specific algorithm family.

Next, domain of the problem: it&#39;s about short-form videos, so &#34;Short-form Video&#34; is definitely one category. They&#39;re focusing on recommendation systems, so &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; should be included.

Specific aspects in recommendation space: The article talks about handling long-term interests, which relates to &#34;Long-term Interests.&#34; Also, they mention serving large models efficiently, so maybe &#34;Model Serving.&#34;

Aspects of evaluation: They discuss enhancing the quality of recommendations and managing serving costs. So categories like &#34;Recommendation Quality,&#34; &#34;Cost Efficiency,&#34; and possibly &#34;Scalability&#34; because it&#39;s about deploying at web scale.

Real-world applications: The solution is an industrial framework, which suggests real-world deployment. Terms like &#34;Industrial Framework,&#34; &#34;A/B Testing&#34; (though they don&#39;t explicitly mention A/B tests), or maybe &#34;Production Systems&#34; could apply here.

Other relevant categories might include the approach taken, such as &#34;Offline Serving,&#34; since they serve models offline asynchronously. Also, &#34;Model-agnostic Methods&#34; because their framework works with any type of user sequence model.

Let me consider each point from the guidelines:

1. **Categorization Accuracy**: I need to make sure each category is appropriate. For example, &#34;Short-form Video&#34; directly relates to the domain. &#34;User Sequence Models&#34; and &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; are central topics.

2. **Category Utility**: The categories should have enough articles. Since this is a specific application within recommendation systems, but still relevant, it&#39;s useful.

3. **User-Centric Design**: Categories like &#34;Long-term Interests&#34; and &#34;Recommendation Quality&#34; align with user experience aspects.

4. **Consistency**: Using standard terms will help maintain consistency across categorizations.

I think I have enough categories: starting from the algorithm family, domain, specific recommendation aspects, evaluation metrics, real-world application, and other relevant methods. Let me list them out:

- User Sequence Models
- Short-form Video
- Recommendation Systems
- Long-term Interests
- Model Serving
- Industrial Framework
- Scalability
- Offline Serving
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Model-agnostic Methods
- Cost Efficiency
- Recommendation Quality

Wait, that&#39;s more than 12 categories. Maybe I can consolidate some. For example, &#34;Model Serving&#34; and &#34;Offline Serving&#34; could be separate or combined? Hmm, perhaps they are distinct enough to keep as separate.

Also, considering the guidelines suggest 8-12 categories, maybe I should pick the most relevant ones without being too granular. Let me see which ones are essential:

- User Sequence Models
- Short-form Video (Domain)
- Recommendation Systems
- Long-term Interests (specific aspect)
- Model Serving (deployment aspect)
- Scalability (evaluation of system performance)
- Cost Efficiency (evaluation metric)
- Industrial Framework (real-world application)
- Model-agnostic Methods (methodology)

That&#39;s 9 categories, which fits within the 8-12 range. But I might have missed some key aspects.

Looking back, they talk about real-world deployment, so &#34;Industrial Application&#34; or &#34;Real-world Applications&#34; could be another category. Also, their approach uses an offline serving method, which is a specific technique, so that&#39;s important to include as &#34;Offline Serving.&#34;

Additionally, since they discuss evaluation beyond just accuracy, like recommendation quality and cost efficiency, maybe &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; is a relevant category.

Putting it all together, I think the main categories should include both the algorithmic approach, domain specifics, recommendation aspects, deployment methods, scalability, evaluation metrics, and real-world application.
&lt;/think&gt;
