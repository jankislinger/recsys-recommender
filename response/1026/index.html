Title: Biased User History Synthesis for Personalized Long-Tail Item Recommendation
Abstract:
Recommendation systems connect users to items and create value chains in the internet economy. Recommendation systems learn from past user-item interaction histories. As such, items that have short interaction histories, either because they are new or not popular, are disproportionately under-recommended. This long-tail item problem can exacerbate model bias, and reinforce poor recommendation of tail items. In this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm, \textit{biased user history synthesis}, to not only address this problem but also achieve better personalization in recommendation systems. As a result, we concurrently improve tail and head item recommendation performance. Our approach is built on a tail item biased User Interaction History (UIH) sampling strategy and a synthesis model that produces an augmented user representation from the sampled user history. We provide a theoretical justification for our approach using information theory and demonstrate through extensive experimentation, that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on tail, head, and overall recommendation. the source code is available at https://github.com/lkp411/BiasedUserHistorySynthesis.

Alright, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories as per the guidelines provided. Let me start by understanding what the article is about.

The title is &#34;Biased User History Synthesis for Personalized Long-Tail Item Recommendation.&#34; Hmm, okay, that sounds like it&#39;s related to recommendation systems, specifically dealing with long-tail items. The abstract mentions that recommendation systems learn from past user interactions and that items with short interaction histories (like new or unpopular ones) are under-recommended, leading to the long-tail item problem.

The authors propose a training algorithm called &#34;biased user history synthesis&#34; which aims to address this issue while improving personalization. They use a sampling strategy for tail items in user interaction histories and build a synthesis model to create an augmented user representation. The results show that their approach outperforms existing methods across different recommendation metrics, including head and tail items.

Now, looking at the guidelines, each article should be assigned 8-12 categories, so I need to think of multiple areas this article fits into. Let&#39;s break it down:

1. **Algorithm Family**: The paper introduces a novel training algorithm called Biased User History Synthesis. So &#34;Algorithm&#34; is definitely one category.

2. **Personalization**: Since the approach aims to improve personalization in recommendations, that&#39;s another relevant category.

3. **Long-Tail Item Recommendation**: This seems specific enough and directly relates to the problem addressed in the paper.

4. **Cold Start Problem**: The long-tail items are often new or less popular, which is a form of the cold start issue where models struggle with items having little historical data.

5. **User Interaction History**: The method uses user interaction history, so that&#39;s another category.

6. **Data Augmentation**: They mention synthesizing an augmented user representation, so this fits here.

7. **Recommendation Systems**: Broad but necessary as the main topic is recommendation systems.

8. **Evaluation Metrics**: They demonstrate performance improvements across various metrics, so evaluation is a key aspect.

9. **Theoretical Justification**: The paper provides theoretical backing using information theory, which is important for academic rigor.

10. **Scalability and Performance**: Their approach improves performance on both head and tail items, indicating better scalability in recommendation systems.

I think that covers 10 categories. Let me see if I can add a couple more:

- **Bias Mitigation**: The method addresses model bias related to long-tail items.
- **Synthesis Model**: Specific mention of the synthesis model used could be another category.

Wait, but some of these might overlap or not fit as neatly. Maybe &#34;Bias Mitigation&#34; is better than having separate categories for each technique. Alternatively, considering user behavior since it&#39;s about how users interact with items.

But to keep within the guidelines and ensure clarity, I&#39;ll stick with the initial 10. Let me structure them clearly.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. The title is &#34;Biased User History Synthesis for Personalized Long-Tail Item Recommendation.&#34; Let me break down the key elements here.

First, the main topic seems to be recommendation systems, specifically addressing long-tail items. The abstract mentions that the paper proposes a novel training algorithm called Biased User History Synthesis. This method aims to improve the recommendation of tail items and achieve better personalization.

Looking at the example categories provided earlier, I should map this article accordingly. 

1. **Family of Algorithm**: Since they&#39;re talking about a training algorithm, perhaps it&#39;s related to synthesis models or some form of machine learning technique used in recommendations. Maybe &#34;Synthesis Models&#34; or &#34;User History Synthesis.&#34;

2. **Domain of the Problem**: The domain here is recommendation systems, specifically dealing with long-tail items. So categories like &#34;Long-Tail Recommendation,&#34; &#34;Item推荐 (Recommendation),&#34; and &#34;Personalized Recommendations&#34; seem relevant.

3. **Specific Aspect in Recommendation Space**: The paper addresses under-recommendation of tail items, so &#34;Cold Start&#34; might not apply here directly, but &#34;Tail Items&#34; is definitely applicable. Also, since they&#39;re talking about personalization, that&#39;s another category.

4. **Evaluation Aspects**: They mention improving both tail and head recommendations, which suggests a focus on overall recommendation performance and possibly personalization metrics. So categories like &#34;Recommendation Performance,&#34; &#34;Personalization,&#34; and maybe &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; could fit.

5. **Real-World Applications**: The abstract doesn&#39;t explicitly mention real-world applications beyond the context of recommendation systems in general. However, since it&#39;s about improving recommendations, which is a real-world application, that might be relevant.

Looking back at the example categories provided earlier:

- Family of algorithm: Since they&#39;re proposing a new training algorithm, maybe &#34;Synthesis Models&#34; or under Encoder (but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the right family). Alternatively, perhaps it falls under Collaborative Filtering or another method. But since the term used is &#34;synthesis model,&#34; I&#39;ll go with that.

- Domain of problem: Definitely recommendation systems, so that&#39;s a primary category.

- Specific in recommendation space: Long-tail items are a key focus here.

- Aspects of evaluation: They mention improving both tail and head performance, which relates to the overall recommendation quality and possibly beyond accuracy metrics since they&#39;re focusing on underrepresented items.

Putting it all together, the categories should include:

- Recommendation Systems (primary domain)
- Long-Tail Items (specific aspect)
- Personalized Recommendations (as they focus on personalization)
- Synthesis Models (family of algorithm)
- User History (since they talk about user interaction history)
- Tail Items (another way to refer to long-tail items)
- Performance Improvement (evaluation aspect)
- Information Theory (they provide theoretical justification using information theory)
- Open Source (as they mention source code availability, though it&#39;s a bit tangential)

Wait, the abstract does mention that the source code is available, which could be another category. So adding &#34;Open Source&#34; makes sense.

So compiling all these, I&#39;ll list them ensuring each is relevant and we cover multiple aspects without being too redundant.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommendation Systems, Long-Tail Items, Personalized Recommendations, Synthesis Models, User History, Tail Items, Performance Improvement, Information Theory, Open Source</code></pre>
