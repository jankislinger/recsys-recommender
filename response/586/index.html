Title: Providing Explainable Race-Time Predictions and Training Plan Recommendations to Marathon Runners
Abstract:
Millions of people participate in marathon events every year, typically devoting at least 12-16 weeks to building their endurance and fitness so that they can safely complete these gruelling 42.2km races. Most runners follow a training plan that is tailored to their expected finish-time (e.g. sub-4 hours or 4-5 hours), and these plans will prescribe a complex mixture of training sessions to help them achieve these times. However, such plans cannot adapt to the individual needs (fitness levels, changing goals, personal preferences) of runners, providing only broad training guidance rather than more personalised support. The development of wearable sensors and mobile fitness applications facilitates the collection of a large amount of training data from runners. In this paper, we propose a recommender system that utilizes such training data to deliver more personalised training advice to runners, using ideas from case-based reasoning to reuse and adapt the training habits of similar runners. Explainability plays a significant role in this type of system, and we also describe how the predictions and recommendation advice can be presented to runners. An initial off-line evaluation is presented based on a large-scale, real-world dataset.

Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about providing explainable race-time predictions and training plan recommendations for marathon runners. Let me break down the key elements from the title and abstract.

First, the title mentions &#34;explainable race-time predictions&#34; and &#34;training plan recommendations.&#34; So, it&#39;s a recommendation system focused on marathon runners. That makes me think of categories like Recommendation Systems and Personalized Recommendations since the system is tailored to individual runners.

The abstract talks about using wearable sensors and mobile apps to collect training data. This points towards Wearable Technology and Sports Applications as relevant areas because the system relies on data from these devices used in sports.

The method described uses case-based reasoning, which is a type of algorithm or approach in machine learning. So categories like Case-Based Reasoning or even Algorithmic Approaches could be applicable here. Also, since it&#39;s about adapting plans based on individual needs, Personalization and Adaptive Systems come to mind.

Explainability is highlighted as important for user trust and understanding. This suggests that categories related to Explainable AI (XAI) are necessary. Users need to understand why certain recommendations are made, so Transparency in Recommendations should also be included.

The evaluation mentioned uses a real-world dataset, which implies Real-World Applications or A/B Testing might not be directly applicable here since it&#39;s an offline evaluation. However, Real-World Applications is still relevant because the system is intended for actual marathon runners.

Another aspect is that the recommendations are based on training data collected over time, so Longitudinal Analysis could be a category here as well.

Looking at the domain of the problem, it&#39;s clearly within Sports and Fitness. The system aims to help users achieve their marathon goals, which ties into Goal-Oriented Recommendations since each runner has specific finish-time targets.

Putting this all together, I should assign categories that cover the recommendation aspect, the technology used, the method, personalization, explainability, evaluation in real-world contexts, and the domain it&#39;s applied to. Each of these areas will help users find the article when searching for related topics.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Providing Explainable Race-Time Predictions and Training Plan Recommendations to Marathon Runners.&#34; So it&#39;s about marathon runners getting personalized training plans based on their data. The abstract talks about how most runners follow training plans tailored to their expected finish times, but these don&#39;t adapt well to individual needs like fitness levels or changing goals. They propose a recommender system using case-based reasoning with wearable sensor and mobile app data.

Okay, first step: identify core themes from the title and abstract. The key areas here are personalized recommendations for marathon runners, training plans, explainable predictions, and the use of machine learning techniques like case-based reasoning.

Next, looking at possible categories to assign. Let&#39;s consider family of algorithms mentioned. They used a recommender system with case-based reasoning, so that&#39;s relevant.

Domain-wise, it&#39;s clearly in Sports or more specifically Athletics/Marathon Training.

They focus on providing personalized recommendations, so Personalization is another category. Also, the predictions are explainable, which relates to Explainability in recommendation systems.

The real-world application here is Wearables since they use data from sensors and mobile apps, and there&#39;s an aspect of Sports Analytics involved.

Additionally, because it&#39;s about helping users achieve specific goals (finish times), Goal-Based Recommendations fit well. They&#39;re also looking at user behavior over time, so maybe Longitudinal Studies? Although that might be stretching a bit, but considering they collect data over weeks, it could be relevant.

Putting it all together, I think the main categories would be Recommender Systems, Personalization, Explainability, Sports, Wearables, Case-Based Reasoning, Real-World Applications, Marathon Training, and maybe Goal-Based Recommendations. That gives us a solid coverage without being too vague or too specific.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommender System, Personalization, Explainability, Sports, Wearables, Case-Based Reasoning, Real-World Applications, Marathon Training, Goal-Based Recommendations</code></pre>
