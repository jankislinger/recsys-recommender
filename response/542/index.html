Title: On Target Item Sampling in Offline Recommender System Evaluation
Abstract:
Target selection is a basic yet often implicit decision in the configuration of offline recommendation experiments. In this paper we research the impact of target sampling on the outcome of comparative recommender system evaluation. Specifically, we undertake a detailed analysis considering the informativeness and consistency of experiments across the target size axis. We find that comparative evaluation using reduced target sets contradicts in many cases the corresponding outcome using large targets, and we provide a principled explanation for these disagreements. We further seek to determine which among the contradicting results may be more reliable. Through comparison to unbiased evaluation, we find that minimum target sets incur in substantial distortion in pairwise system comparisons, while maximum sets may not be ideal either, and better options may lie in between the extremes. We further find means for informing the target size setting in the common case where unbiased evaluation is not possible, by an assessment of the discriminative power of evaluation, that remarkably aligns with the agreement with unbiased evaluation.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me read through it carefully.

The title is &#34;On Target Item Sampling in Offline Recommender System Evaluation.&#34; So right away, I know this is about recommendation systems, specifically evaluating them offline. The key terms here are target item sampling and evaluation methods.

Looking at the abstract, they talk about target selection as a basic but often overlooked part of setting up experiments for recommendation systems. They analyze how different target sizes affect the results of comparative evaluations. They find that using smaller targets can lead to different outcomes compared to larger ones, which is an important consideration for researchers and practitioners.

The paper also discusses the informativeness and consistency of experiments across various target sizes. It mentions that both minimum and maximum target sets have issuesâ€”smaller sets cause distortion in comparisons, while larger ones might not be perfect either. They propose a middle ground approach and discuss how to assess the discriminative power when unbiased evaluation isn&#39;t possible.

Now, I need to map this into categories. From the guidelines, categories can include algorithm families, problem domains, specific recommendation aspects, evaluation aspects, real-world applications, etc.

First, since it&#39;s about recommendation systems, that&#39;s a primary category. Then, looking at the methods used and discussed: target item sampling is a technique related to evaluation strategies in recommendation systems, so Evaluation Strategies makes sense.

The paper deals with comparative analysis of different recommendation systems under varying conditions, which falls under Comparative Analysis.

They focus on offline evaluation, meaning they&#39;re not testing in real-time but using historical data. So Offline Evaluation is another category.

Target sampling is a specific aspect within the evaluation process, so Target Sampling would be relevant.

The issue of target size affecting results relates to experimental design because it&#39;s about how experiments are set up and conducted. Hence, Experimental Design.

They discuss different approaches or techniques in evaluating recommendation systems, so Evaluation Techniques fits here.

Since they&#39;re talking about setting parameters like target sizes, Parameter Setting is another category.

The paper provides insights into best practices for evaluation, which ties into Best Practices.

Lastly, while it&#39;s a methodological study, it has practical implications for improving recommendation systems. Therefore, Methodology &amp; Practice is appropriate.

I think these categories cover the main aspects of the article without being too narrow or overlapping excessively. They should help users find this article when exploring topics related to evaluation methods in recommendation systems.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. The title is &#34;On Target Item Sampling in Offline Recommender System Evaluation.&#34; Hmm, let me break it down.

First, the main topic seems to be about recommendation systems, specifically offline ones. So that&#39;s definitely within the recommender system domain. I&#39;ll note that under &#34;Recommender Systems.&#34;

The paper discusses target item sampling and its impact on evaluating these systems. They talk about how selecting different target sets affects experiments. That sounds like it&#39;s related to evaluation methods in recommenders, so I should add &#34;Evaluation Methods&#34; as a category.

They mention the aspect of target size and how varying that can lead to different results. This seems specific within the evaluation context, so maybe &#34;Target Sampling&#34; would be another category.

The abstract also talks about comparing systems using reduced or maximum target sets and finding distortions. This relates to issues in evaluations where metrics might not capture the right aspects, which points to problems like bias or reliability in evaluations. So I&#39;ll include &#34;Evaluation Bias.&#34;

Additionally, they discuss the trade-offs between different target sizes and how it affects the evaluation&#39;s informativeness and consistency. That makes me think about the practical implications of choosing targets, so perhaps something like &#34;Practical Evaluation&#34; would fit here.

Another point is that they provide a principled explanation for disagreements in results when using different target sets. This seems to touch on underlying principles or theories within recommendation systems, so maybe adding &#34;Theoretical Foundations&#34; would be appropriate.

Lastly, the paper suggests methods for setting target sizes when unbiased evaluation isn&#39;t possible. That&#39;s about optimizing the evaluation process, which makes me think of &#34;Optimization Techniques.&#34;

So putting it all together, I&#39;ll list these categories to cover the main aspects: Recommender Systems, Evaluation Methods, Target Sampling, Evaluation Bias, Practical Evaluation, Theoretical Foundations, and Optimization Techniques.
&lt;/think&gt;
