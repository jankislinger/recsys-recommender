        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Deep Bayesian Bandits: Exploring in Online Personalized Recommendations
Abstract:
Recommender systems trained in a continuous learning fashion are plagued by the feedback loop problem, also known as algorithmic bias. This causes a newly trained model to act greedily and favor items that have already been engaged by users. This behavior is particularly harmful in personalised ads recommendations, as it can also cause new campaigns to remain unexplored. Exploration aims to address this limitation by providing new information about the environment, which encompasses user preference, and can lead to higher long-term reward. In this work, we formulate a display advertising recommender as a contextual bandit and implement exploration techniques that require sampling from the posterior distribution of click-through-rates in a computationally tractable manner. Traditional large-scale deep learning models do not provide uncertainty estimates by default. We approximate these uncertainty measurements of the predictions by employing a bootstrapped model with multiple heads and dropout units. We benchmark a number of different models in an offline simulation environment using a publicly available dataset of user-ads engagements. We test our proposed deep Bayesian bandits algorithm in the offline simulation and online AB setting with large-scale production traffic, where we demonstrate a positive gain of our exploration model.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article about Deep Bayesian Bandits for personalized recommendations. Let me start by understanding the title and abstract.

The title mentions &#34;Deep Bayesian Bandits&#34; and their application in online personalized recommendations. The abstract talks about feedback loops and algorithmic bias in recommender systems, especially in display advertising. It introduces a contextual bandit approach to address exploration, using posterior distributions of click-through rates. They use a bootstrapped model with dropout for uncertainty estimation.

So, the key themes here are:

1. **Recommender Systems**: Clearly central, as the article is about recommendations.
2. **Contextual Bandits**: The method used in this work.
3. **Bayesian Methods**: Since they&#39;re using Bayesian approaches for exploration.
4. **Personalization**: Tailoring recommendations to individual users.
5. **Deep Learning**: They mention deep learning models with multiple heads and dropout.
6. **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Addressing the feedback loop through exploration techniques.
7. **Algorithmic Bias**: Discussing how continuous learning leads to bias, which is a big issue in ML.
8. **Display Advertising**: The specific application domain.
9. **Uncertainty Estimation**: Using bootstrapped models and dropout for this purpose.
10. **Offline Simulation and Online AB Testing**: They tested their model both offline and online, which shows real-world application.
11. **Large-Scale Applications**: It&#39;s intended for production environments with high traffic.

I should assign these to categories that cover the methodology (like Contextual Bandits, Bayesian Methods), the problem areas (Algorithmic Bias, Personalization), the domain (Display Advertising), evaluation methods (Offline Simulation, Online AB Testing), and technical aspects like Deep Learning and Uncertainty Estimation. Also, since it&#39;s about handling feedback loops and improving recommendation diversity, categories like Feedback Loop and Diversity might be relevant.

Wait, does &#34;Diversity of Recommendations&#34; fit here? The article focuses more on exploration to avoid bias rather than explicitly promoting diversity, but they do mention providing new information which can enhance long-term reward. Maybe that ties into diversity indirectly. Alternatively, I could consider if there&#39;s a category like &#34;Exploration vs Exploitation,&#34; which is directly mentioned.

I should make sure each category is clear and as per the guidelines, aiming for 8-12 categories. Let me list them:

Recommender Systems, Contextual Bandits, Bayesian Methods, Personalization, Deep Learning, Exploration vs Exploitation, Algorithmic Bias, Display Advertising, Uncertainty Estimation, Feedback Loop, Online AB Testing, Large-Scale Applications.

That&#39;s 12 categories, which fits the guidelines. Each is relevant and should help users find the article when exploring these topics.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommender Systems, Contextual Bandits, Bayesian Methods, Personalization, Deep Learning, Exploration vs Exploitation, Algorithmic Bias, Display Advertising, Uncertainty Estimation, Feedback Loop, Online AB Testing, Large-Scale Applications.</code></pre>
