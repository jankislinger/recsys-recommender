Title: Enhancing Structural Diversity in Social Networks by Recommending Weak Ties
Abstract:
Contact recommendation has become a common functionality in online social platforms, and an established research topic in the social networks and recommender systems fields. Predicting and recommending links has been mainly addressed to date as an accuracy-targeting problem. In this paper we put forward a different perspective, considering that correctly predicted links may not be all equally valuable. Contact recommendation brings an opportunity to drive the structural evolution towards desirable properties of the network as a whole, beyond the sum of the isolated gains for the individual users to whom recommendations are delivered –global properties that we may want to assess and promote as explicit recommendation targets. In this perspective, we research the definition of relevant diversity metrics drawing from social network analysis concepts, and linking to prior diversity notions in recommender systems. In particular, we elaborate on the notion of weak tie recommendation as a means to enhance the structural diversity of networks. In order to show the signification of the proposed metrics, we report experiments with Twitter data illustrating how state of the art contact recommendation methods compare in terms of our metrics; we examine the tradeoff with accuracy, and we show that diverse link recommendations result in a corresponding diversity enhancement in the flow of information through the network, with potential implications in mitigating filter bubbles.

Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about enhancing structural diversity in social networks by recommending weak ties. Let me break down what the paper is about and figure out which categories it fits into.

First, the title mentions &#34;Structural Diversity&#34; so that&#39;s a key term. The abstract talks about contact recommendations in online platforms, which falls under Recommender Systems. Social Networks are clearly another category since the focus is on how these networks evolve.

The article discusses using weak ties as a recommendation strategy. I remember reading that weak ties can help in diversifying connections beyond just strong ones, so &#34;Weak Ties&#34; should be a category. It also mentions metrics for diversity and their impact on the network structure, which ties into &#34;Network Structure.&#34;

They conducted experiments with Twitter data, indicating real-world applications, so &#34;Real World Application&#34; is appropriate. They looked at trade-offs between accuracy and diversity, so that&#39;s another point.

The abstract talks about how diverse recommendations affect information flow and filter bubbles, touching on &#34;Information Flow&#34; and the broader impact of recommendations beyond just accuracy—so &#34;Beyond Accuracy.&#34;

They also mention using state-of-the-art methods for contact recommendation, which relates to &#34;Contact Recommendation.&#34; Additionally, they link their work to prior diversity concepts in recommender systems, so that&#39;s another angle.

I think categories like &#34;Social Network Analysis&#34; and &#34;Recommender Systems Evaluation&#34; might fit too since the paper evaluates existing methods against new metrics. But I should check if those are among the suggested examples. The user provided examples include things like Family of Algorithm, Domain, Specific recommendation aspects, evaluation aspects, real-world applications.

Looking back, they mentioned using Twitter data for experiments, which is a real application, so &#34;Real World Application&#34; makes sense. They evaluate existing methods against new metrics—so that&#39;s an aspect of evaluation, maybe under &#34;Evaluation Metrics.&#34; 

I also see that they talk about enhancing structural diversity as a goal beyond individual accuracy, so that&#39;s another angle. The paper introduces new diversity metrics based on social network concepts and prior work in recommendation systems.

Putting it all together: Structural Diversity, Social Networks, Recommender Systems, Weak Ties, Network Structure, Real World Application, Evaluation Metrics, Beyond Accuracy, Contact Recommendation, Information Flow, Filter Bubbles (though I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a category). Maybe &#34;Social Network Analysis&#34; instead of Filter Bubbles.

I need to ensure each article is assigned 8-12 categories. Let me list them out clearly:

1. Structural Diversity
2. Social Networks
3. Recommender Systems
4. Weak Ties
5. Network Structure
6. Real World Application
7. Evaluation Metrics
8. Beyond Accuracy
9. Contact Recommendation
10. Information Flow

That&#39;s 10 categories, which fits the guideline. I think that covers all aspects of the article without being too specific or too broad.
&lt;/think&gt;

Structural Diversity, Social Networks, Recommender Systems, Weak Ties, Network Structure, Real World Application, Evaluation Metrics, Beyond Accuracy, Contact Recommendation, Information Flow</code></pre>

Okay, I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading them carefully.

The title is &#34;Enhancing Structural Diversity in Social Networks by Recommending Weak Ties.&#34; So it&#39;s about social networks and recommendation systems, specifically focusing on weak ties and structural diversity.

Looking at the abstract: The paper discusses contact recommendations in online platforms, moving beyond accuracy to consider the value of links. It introduces a new perspective where correctly predicted but not equally valuable links can drive network properties. They talk about using metrics from social network analysis and relate them to diversity concepts in recommender systems. Specifically, they focus on weak ties as a way to enhance structural diversity.

They conducted experiments with Twitter data, comparing state-of-the-art methods based on their proposed metrics. They also examined the trade-off between diversity and accuracy, showing that diverse recommendations can mitigate filter bubbles by enhancing information flow.

So, key themes here are social networks, recommendation systems, weak ties, structural diversity, metrics for evaluation, network properties, and real-world applications like mitigating filter bubbles.

Now, considering the categories from the guidelines: family of algorithms isn&#39;t mentioned, but the focus is more on the domain (social networks) and specific aspects like weak ties. Evaluation aspects include diversity beyond accuracy. Real-world applications involve things like A/B testing or user surveys, but in this case, it&#39;s about network flow and filter bubbles.

I should assign multiple categories to ensure discoverability. The article deals with both theoretical concepts (diversity metrics, structural properties) and practical implications (social networks, recommendation systems).

Possible categories:

1. Social Networks: Core domain.
2. Recommendation Systems: Main focus area.
3. Weak Ties: Specific aspect of the paper.
4. Structural Diversity: Key theme.
5. Evaluation Metrics: They introduce new metrics.
6. Network Properties: Focus on global network properties.
7. Real-World Applications: Mitigating filter bubbles is an application.

I need to make sure each category has enough articles, so I&#39;ll stick with these that are relevant and broad enough. Also, they cover both the specific (weak ties) and broader concepts like diversity in recommendations.
&lt;/think&gt;

Structural Diversity, Social Networks, Weak Ties, Recommendation Systems, Evaluation Metrics, Network Properties, Real-World Applications</code></pre>
