        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Knowledge-aware Recommendations Based on Neuro-Symbolic Graph Embeddings and First-Order Logical Rules
Abstract:
In this paper, we present a knowledge-aware recommendation framework based on neuro-symbolic graph embeddings that encode first-order logical (FOL) rules. In particular, our workflow starts from a knowledge graph (KG) encoding user preferences (based on explicit ratings [13]) and item properties. Next, knowledge-aware recommendation are obtained through the combination of three modules: (i) a rule learner, that extracts FOL rules from the KG; (ii) a graph embedding module, that learns the embeddings of users and items based on the triples of the KG and the FOL rules previously extracted; (iii) a recommendation module that uses the embeddings to feed a deep learning architecture. In the experimental session, we evaluate the effectiveness of our strategy on two datasets and the results show that the combination of KG embeddings and FOL rules led to an improvement in the accuracy and in the novelty of the recommendations.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Alright, let me try to figure out how to categorize this article. The title mentions &#34;Knowledge-aware Recommendations&#34; using &#34;Neuro-Symbolic Graph Embeddings&#34; and &#34;First-Order Logical Rules.&#34; So, I&#39;m thinking this is about recommendation systems that incorporate some form of structured knowledge or logic.

Looking at the abstract, they talk about a framework that starts with a knowledge graph encoding user preferences and item properties. They use three modules: rule learner, graph embedding, and recommendation module. The evaluation shows improvements in accuracy and novelty.

So, for categories:

1. **Neuro-Symbolic Methods**: Since it combines neural networks with symbolic logic (FOL rules).
2. **Graph Embeddings**: Focuses on embeddings from graphs.
3. **Knowledge Graphs**: They use KG as a foundation.
4. **Recommendation Systems**: The main application is recommendations.
5. **First-Order Logic**: Explicitly mentioned in the title and abstract.
6. **User Preferences**: They encode user preferences in the KG.
7. **Item Properties**: Also part of the KG encoding.
8. **Rule Learning**: Module extracts FOL rules, so rule learning applies.
9. **Deep Learning Architecture**: The recommendation module uses deep learning.

Wait, does it cover other aspects? Let me think about evaluation. They mention accuracy and novelty in recommendations, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a separate category or part of something else. Maybe &#34;Evaluation Metrics&#34; but the examples didn&#39;t include that specifically. Alternatively, maybe &#34;Recommendation Accuracy.&#34; Hmm, perhaps better to stick with what&#39;s provided.

Also, considering other categories like &#34;Neural Networks,&#34; since it&#39;s a deep learning architecture. But I think &#34;Deep Learning Architecture&#34; is more specific and already included.

So compiling these thoughts into the main relevant categories without going too narrow or broad.
&lt;/think&gt;

Neuro-Symbolic Methods, Graph Embeddings, Knowledge Graphs, Recommendation Systems, First-Order Logic, User Preferences, Item Properties, Rule Learning, Deep Learning Architecture</code></pre>
