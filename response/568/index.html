Title: Free Lunch! Retrospective Uplift Modeling for Dynamic Promotions Recommendation within ROI Constraints
Abstract:
Promotions and discounts have become key components of modern e-commerce platforms. For online travel platforms (OTPs), popular promotions include room upgrades, free meals and transportation services. By offering these promotions, customers can get more value for their money, while both the OTP and its travel partners may grow their loyal customer base. However, the promotions usually incur a cost that, if uncontrolled, can become unsustainable. Consequently, for a promotion to be viable, its associated costs must be balanced by incremental revenue within set financial constraints. Personalized treatment assignment can be used to satisfy such constraints. This paper introduces a novel uplift modeling technique, relying on the Knapsack Problem formulation, that dynamically optimizes the incremental treatmentâ€™s outcome subject to the required Return on Investment (ROI) constraints. The technique leverages Retrospective Estimation, a modeling approach that relies solely on data from positive outcome examples. The method also addresses training data bias, long term effects, and seasonality challenges via online-dynamic calibration. This approach was tested via offline experiments and online randomized controlled trials at Booking.com - a leading OTP with millions of customers worldwide, resulting in a significant increase in the target outcome while staying within the required financial constraints and outperforming other approaches.

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about dynamic promotions recommendation using uplift modeling. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Free Lunch! Retrospective Uplift Modeling for Dynamic Promotions Recommendation within ROI Constraints.&#34; The abstract talks about how promotions and discounts are crucial in e-commerce, especially for online travel platforms (OTPs). They mention specific examples like room upgrades, free meals, and transportation. The goal is to offer these promotions sustainably without incurring too much cost.

The paper introduces a novel uplift modeling technique based on the Knapsack Problem, which helps optimize outcomes under ROI constraints. It uses Retrospective Estimation, relying only on positive outcome data, and addresses issues like training bias, long-term effects, and seasonality with online calibration. They tested it at Booking.com, showing improved results compared to other methods.

Now, I need to assign categories based on the guidelines. The article is about recommendation systems, so &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; should definitely be a category. It&#39;s focused on promotions, so &#34;Promotions&#34; makes sense. Uplift modeling is a specific technique mentioned, so that&#39;s another one. ROI constraints are central, so that&#39;s relevant too.

The domain here is e-commerce, specifically online travel platforms, which I can categorize under both &#34;E-Commerce&#34; and &#34;Travel.&#34; They mention using data from positive outcomes with Retrospective Estimation, so maybe &#34;Data Utilization&#34; or something similar, but perhaps more specific like &#34;Retrospective Estimation.&#34;

They address challenges like training bias, long-term effects, and seasonality. These are technical aspects of the model&#39;s application, so categories like &#34;Bias Mitigation,&#34; &#34;Long-term Effects,&#34; and &#34;Seasonality&#34; would fit.

The evaluation method involves offline experiments and online randomized controlled trials (A/B tests), so &#34;Evaluation Methods,&#34; &#34;Offline Experiments,&#34; and &#34;Online A/B Testing&#34; should be included. They also mention the Knapsack Problem, which is an optimization technique, so that&#39;s another category.

Considering user-centric design, categories like &#34;ROI Optimization&#34; are important for businesses looking to implement such systems. The application at Booking.com shows real-world usage, so &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; fits here too.

Putting it all together, I think the categories should cover the main themes: recommendation systems, promotions, uplift modeling, ROI constraints, e-commerce, travel, data utilization (retrospective estimation), optimization techniques like Knapsack, evaluation methods, handling bias and long-term effects, seasonality, real-world applications, and application-specific areas like online travel. I need to ensure each category is relevant and covers the article&#39;s content without being too broad or narrow.

I should also make sure there are enough categories (8-12) as per guidelines, so maybe 12 would be appropriate here. Let me list them out:

1. Recommendation Systems
2. Promotions
3. Uplift Modeling
4. ROI Constraints
5. E-Commerce
6. Travel
7. Retrospective Estimation
8. Knapsack Problem (Optimization)
9. Evaluation Methods
10. Offline Experiments
11. Online A/B Testing
12. Real-World Applications

This covers the key aspects of the article, ensuring it&#39;s discoverable under various relevant topics and is placed in categories that are useful for navigation.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I&#39;m looking at this research article titled &#34;Free Lunch! Retrospective Uplift Modeling for Dynamic Promotions Recommendation within ROI Constraints.&#34; The abstract discusses how promotions in e-commerce, particularly in online travel platforms (OTPs), are crucial but come with costs that need to be balanced. The paper introduces a new uplift modeling technique based on the Knapsack Problem, aiming to optimize treatments under ROI constraints.

First, I&#39;ll break down the key themes and content of the article. It focuses on promotions and their impact on customer value and business growth. The core challenge is balancing costs with incremental revenue, which ties into financial constraints and Return on Investment (ROI). The solution proposed is a novel uplift modeling technique that uses Retrospective Estimation, addressing issues like data bias, long-term effects, and seasonality through dynamic calibration.

Now, considering the categorization guidelines, I need to assign this article to multiple relevant categories. Starting with the family of algorithms mentioned, the Knapsack Problem is clearly an algorithm used here. Uplift modeling is another specific technique in recommendation systems.

Looking at the domain, it&#39;s within e-commerce and specifically online travel platforms (OTPs). So those should be included as categories. The article also deals with ROI constraints, which falls under aspects of evaluation related to financial metrics.

Promotions are a key aspect here, so that&#39;s another category. Retrospective Estimation is a specific method used, so adding that makes sense. Dynamic calibration and long-term effects are challenges addressed, so those should be included as well.

Additionally, real-world applications are mentioned through experiments at Booking.com, involving A/B testing. Therefore, A/B Testing falls under real-world applications. Scalability is implied due to the dynamic nature of the approach, even though it&#39;s not explicitly stated.

Finally, since the article deals with recommendation systems in a specific domain (travel), including &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; as a broader category makes sense.
&lt;/think&gt;
