        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Using Citation-Context to Reduce Topic Drifting on Pure Citation-Based Recommendation
Abstract:
Recent works in the area of academic recommender systems have demonstrated the effectiveness of co-citation and citation closeness in related-document recommendations. However, documents recommended from such systems may drift away from the main concept of the query document. In this work, we investigate whether incorporating the textual information in close proximity to a citation as well as the citation position could reduce such drifting and further increase the performance of the recommender system. To investigate this, we run experiments with several recommendation methods on a newly created and now publicly available dataset containing 53 million unique citation based records. We then conduct a user-based evaluation with domain-knowledgeable participants. Our results show that a new method based on the combination of Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA), topic modelling and word embeddings achieve more than 20% improvement in Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) compared to CPA.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Okay, I&#39;m trying to figure out how to categorize this research article. The title is &#34;Using Citation-Context to Reduce Topic Drifting on Pure Citation-Based Recommendation.&#34; So it&#39;s about academic recommender systems, specifically using citation information.

The abstract mentions that co-citation and citation closeness are effective but can cause drifting from the main topic. They propose using textual context around citations and their positions to improve recommendations. They tested this with several methods on a dataset of 53 million citations and did user evaluations with experts. The new method, combining CPA, topic modeling, and word embeddings, improved nDCG by over 20%.

So for categories, I&#39;ll start with the main areas: Academic Recommender Systems is definitely one. Citation-Based Methods makes sense since they&#39;re focusing on citations.

The problem domain here is academia or academic research because it&#39;s about recommending documents in that context. So adding Academic Research and Academic Domain would be good.

They mentioned using topic modeling and word embeddings, so those are specific techniques used in the article. Therefore, I&#39;ll include Topic Modeling and Word Embeddings.

Evaluation-wise, they did user-based evaluations with domain experts, which falls under User Evaluation or maybe Evaluation Metrics since nDCG is a metric. So perhaps Domain Expert Evaluation and Evaluation Metrics would be appropriate categories.

The issue of topic drifting is addressed here, so that&#39;s another category: Topic Drifting. Also, their approach includes CPA combined with other methods, so Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA) should be included.

The dataset they used is large, which relates to scalability. So Scalability is a relevant category as well.

They ran experiments with several recommendation methods, so Recommender Systems and Recommendation Methods are key categories too.

Lastly, since it&#39;s about combining different techniques to improve recommendations beyond just citations, Beyond Citation-Based would fit here.

Putting it all together, the categories cover both technical aspects (like CPA, topic modeling) and evaluation methods, as well as domain-specific areas. This should help users find the article when looking for academic recommenders, citation-based techniques, or evaluation studies.
&lt;/think&gt;
