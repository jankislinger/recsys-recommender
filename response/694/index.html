Title: Optimizing the Selection of Recommendation Carousels with Quantum Computing
Abstract:
It has been long known that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the way we find solutions of problems that are difficult to solve on classical computers. It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple. We discuss its effectiveness, limitations and possible future directions of development.

Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about optimizing recommendation carousels using quantum computing. Let&#39;s start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Recommendation Carousels&#34; and &#34;Quantum Computing.&#34; The abstract explains that they&#39;re using quantum computers to solve a problem related to recommender systems, specifically selecting which carousels (like lists of recommendations) to display on platforms like video-on-demand or music streaming services. They use the D-Wave quantum annealer and an adiabatic computing approach.

So first, I need to identify key elements here: recommendation systems, optimization, quantum computing, specifically quantum annealing, adiabatic computing. The domain is online services, likely in entertainment since they mention video-on-demand and music streaming. They also talk about carousel selection as a problem, which relates to the user interface or user experience.

They discuss evaluating their approach&#39;s effectiveness and limitations, so evaluation aspects are important. Also, real-world applications because they&#39;re using cloud-based quantum computers for testing.

Looking at the examples provided, categories could include:

- Quantum Computing (since that&#39;s a main focus)
- Recommendation Systems (the application area)
- Optimization Algorithms (as they&#39;re optimizing carousel selection)
- Adiabatic Computing (a specific method used)
- User Interface/Experience (related to how recommendations are presented)
- Online Services (the domain where this is applied)
- Evaluation Methods (since they discuss effectiveness)
- Real-world Applications (they implemented it on cloud quantum annealer)

I should make sure each category is clear and relevant. Maybe also include things like Carousel Selection or Problem Formulation, but I&#39;m not sure if those are standard categories. The guidelines suggest being specific but ensuring the categories are user-friendly.

So compiling all these points, the relevant categories would be Quantum Computing, Recommendation Systems, Optimization Algorithms, Adiabatic Computing, User Interface/Experience, Online Services, Evaluation Methods, and Real-world Applications.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about optimizing recommendation carousels using quantum computing. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Optimizing the Selection of Recommendation Carousels with Quantum Computing.&#34; From that, I immediately get that it&#39;s about recommendation systems in some digital service, like a video-on-demand platform or music streaming, where they have these carousels of recommendations. The main focus here is using quantum computing to solve an optimization problem related to selecting which carousels to display.

Looking at the abstract, it explains that recommendation carousel selection is challenging because you need to consider how different lists interact—like avoiding duplicates and helping users explore the catalogue. They&#39;re using a D-Wave quantum annealer, specifically the adiabatic computing paradigm, to solve this NP-hard optimization problem.

So, breaking down the key elements here:

1. **Recommendation Systems**: The article is definitely about recommender systems, so that&#39;s a primary category.
2. **Quantum Computing**: They&#39;re using quantum annealing for optimization, which ties into both the technology and the method of computation.
3. **Optimization Problems**: This is clearly an optimization task, as they&#39;re trying to find the best set of carousels to display.
4. **Recommendation Carousels**: These are specific UI elements in recommendation systems, so that&#39;s another category.
5. **Black Box Recommenders**: The paper mentions black box recommenders, which suggests it&#39;s applicable to a variety of existing recommendation algorithms, regardless of their internal workings.

Additionally, the article discusses practical applications in video-on-demand and music streaming services. It also touches on aspects like avoiding duplicate recommendations and user exploration, which are specific functionalities within recommendation systems.

I should make sure each category is relevant but not too narrow or too broad. They need to be useful for users navigating the content. Also, according to the guidelines, I should assign at least 8-12 categories, so let me see if there are more applicable ones.

Thinking about other aspects: since they&#39;re using a D-Wave quantum annealer available on the cloud, maybe &#34;Cloud Computing&#34; is relevant? But that&#39;s more of an infrastructure aspect. Alternatively, considering it&#39;s about optimization and NP-hard problems, &#34;Algorithm Optimization&#34; could be another category.

Wait, but in the examples provided, categories like &#34;Family of algorithm&#34; (e.g., Matrix Factorization) or &#34;Domain of the problem&#34; are listed. So perhaps I should consider whether this is more about the method (quantum computing) or the application (recommendation systems). 

Another thought: The article deals with selecting multiple recommendation lists, which might relate to aspects like diversity in recommendations. They mention avoiding duplicates and helping user exploration, so &#34;Diversity of Recommendations&#34; could be a category.

Also, since they&#39;re using quantum computing for optimization, perhaps &#34;Scalability&#34; is relevant if the solution scales better than classical methods.

But I should stick to the categories outlined in the guidelines: family of algorithm, domain of problem, specific aspects like cold start, evaluation aspects, real-world applications, etc.

Wait, maybe the following categories apply:

- **Recommendation Systems**: Primary category.
- **Quantum Computing**: As they use a quantum annealer.
- **Optimization Problems**: Directly related to their approach.
- **Recommendation Carousels**: Specific UI element.
- **Black Box Recommenders**: Mentioned in the abstract.
- **Video-on-Demand/ Music Streaming**: Domain of the problem, as it&#39;s applied to these services.
- **Adiabatic Computing**: The specific quantum computing paradigm used.
- **D-Wave Quantum Annealer**: The specific tool they used.

That makes 8 categories. Let me check if there are more applicable ones. Maybe &#34;User Interface&#34; since carousels are part of the UI, but that&#39;s perhaps too broad. Alternatively, &#34;Cloud Computing&#34; because they use cloud-based quantum computers, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s central enough.

Alternatively, considering the evaluation aspects: They discuss effectiveness and limitations, which might relate to evaluation metrics or beyond accuracy, but since it&#39;s more about the method than the evaluation itself, maybe that&#39;s stretching it.

I think sticking with the 8 categories is sufficient for now. Let me list them again:

1. Recommendation Systems
2. Quantum Computing
3. Optimization Problems
4. Recommendation Carousels
5. Black Box Recommenders
6. Video-on-Demand/Music Streaming
7. Adiabatic Computing
8. D-Wave Quantum Annealer

Yes, these seem relevant and specific enough without being too narrow or too broad.
&lt;/think&gt;
