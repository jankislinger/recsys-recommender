Title: Interpretable User Retention Modeling in Recommendation
Abstract:
Recommendation usually focuses on immediate accuracy metrics like CTR as training objectives. User retention rate, which reflects the percentage of todayâ€™s users that will return to the recommender system in the next few days, should be paid more attention to in real-world systems. User retention is the most intuitive and accurate reflection of user long-term satisfaction. However, most existing recommender systems are not focused on user retention-related objectives, since their complexity and uncertainty make it extremely hard to discover why a user will or will not return to a system and which behaviors affect user retention. In this work, we conduct a series of preliminary explorations on discovering and making full use of the reasons for user retention in recommendation. Specifically, we make a first attempt to design a rationale contrastive multi-instance learning framework to explore the rationale and improve the interpretability of user retention. Extensive offline and online evaluations with detailed analyses of a real-world recommender system verify the effectiveness of our user retention modeling. We further reveal the real-world interpretable factors of user retention from both user surveys and explicit negative feedback quantitative analyses to facilitate future model designs.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

The title is &#34;Interpretable User Retention Modeling in Recommendation.&#34; The abstract talks about recommendation systems focusing on immediate metrics like CTR but not considering user retention rates enough. It mentions that user retention reflects long-term satisfaction, which isn&#39;t a focus in most systems because it&#39;s complex and uncertain. The authors propose a rationale contrastive multi-instance learning framework to explore these reasons and improve interpretability. They also conducted evaluations using both offline and online methods on a real-world system and gathered insights from user surveys and explicit negative feedback.

Now, I need to map this article into the appropriate categories. Let&#39;s consider each guideline:

1. **Categorization Accuracy**: The core themes here are user retention in recommendation systems, interpretability of models, and the use of specific learning frameworks like contrastive multi-instance learning. There&#39;s also a focus on real-world applications with A/B testing and user surveys.

2. **Category Utility**: I need to ensure that each category is broad enough but still relevant. For example, &#34;User Retention&#34; is specific but necessary here because it&#39;s the main focus. Similarly, &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; is a broader category that this article definitely falls into.

3. **User-Centric Design**: Users of this interface might be interested in understanding how recommendation systems affect user behavior over time, so categories like &#34;Long-term User Satisfaction&#34; and &#34;User Behavior Analysis&#34; seem relevant.

4. **Consistency**: I should use consistent terms across all articles to avoid confusion. For instance, using &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; instead of just &#34;Recommendations&#34; keeps it uniform.

Looking at the example categories provided earlier, some that might fit here include:

- **Family of Algorithm**: The article uses a contrastive multi-instance learning framework, so maybe &#34;Multi-Instance Learning&#34; or more specifically, &#34;Rationale Contrastive Multi-Instance Learning.&#34;

- **Domain of the Problem**: This is about recommendation systems in general, so &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; and perhaps a specific application like &#34;User Retention.&#34;

- **Specific Recommendation Space Aspects**: Cold Start isn&#39;t mentioned here, but maybe something else? The focus on retention could be its own category.

- **Aspects of Evaluation**: They mention offline and online evaluations, A/B tests, user surveys, so categories like &#34;A/B Testing,&#34; &#34;Offline Evaluation,&#34; &#34;Online Evaluation,&#34; and &#34;User Surveys&#34; are relevant.

- **Real-world Applications**: There&#39;s a real-world recommender system involved, and they discuss factors affecting retention from both user surveys and negative feedback. So &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; is appropriate.

Additionally, the article discusses improving model interpretability, so categories like &#34;Interpretable Models,&#34; &#34;Model Interpretability,&#34; or similar might be useful. It also touches on understanding why users return, which ties into user behavior analysis.

I should aim for at least 8-12 categories. Let me list out possible categories:

1. User Retention
2. Recommendation Systems
3. Interpretable Models
4. Model Interpretability
5. Rationale Contrastive Multi-Instance Learning (or just &#34;Multi-Instance Learning&#34;)
6. A/B Testing
7. Offline Evaluation
8. Online Evaluation
9. Real-World Applications
10. User Surveys
11. Explicit Negative Feedback
12. Long-term User Satisfaction
13. User Behavior Analysis

I should ensure that these categories are clear and align with the user&#39;s needs. For example, &#34;User Retention&#34; is specific but necessary, while &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; is broader.

Let me see if I can narrow it down to 8-12 without redundancy:

- User Retention
- Recommendation Systems
- Interpretable Models
- Model Interpretability
- Multi-Instance Learning (since the framework might be a variation)
- A/B Testing
- Offline Evaluation
- Online Evaluation
- Real-World Applications
- User Surveys
- Explicit Negative Feedback
- Long-term User Satisfaction

That&#39;s 12 categories, which fits within the recommended range. I think these cover all aspects of the article: the focus on user retention, the recommendation system domain, the algorithm used (multi-instance learning), evaluation methods both online and offline, real-world applications with A/B tests and surveys, as well as factors like explicit feedback and long-term satisfaction.

I should avoid creating too many niche categories that might not be useful for navigation. For example, &#34;Rationale Contrastive Multi-Instance Learning&#34; is quite specific, so maybe just &#34;Multi-Instance Learning&#34; suffices unless there are other articles using the same specific framework.

Finalizing the list:
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. The article is about &#34;Interpretable User Retention Modeling in Recommendation.&#34; Let me read through the abstract carefully.

The main focus seems to be on user retention rates as a metric for evaluating recommender systems. They mention that while most systems focus on immediate accuracy metrics like CTR, user retention provides a better long-term measure of satisfaction. The authors propose a new framework using rationale contrastive multi-instance learning to improve interpretability. They also conducted both offline and online evaluations and analyzed real-world data from surveys and negative feedback.

Looking at the categories I need to assign: 

1. **User Retention**: This is clearly the primary theme since the article focuses on modeling user retention.
2. **Interpretability**: The framework aims to make the model&#39;s decisions more understandable, so this is relevant.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: They discuss using user retention rate as a metric, which falls under evaluation methods.
4. **Recommender Systems**: This is fundamental since it&#39;s about recommendation systems.
5. **Long-term User Behavior**: The study looks at how users interact over time beyond immediate feedback.
6. **User Feedback**: Both surveys and explicit negative feedback are used in their analysis.

I should make sure each category is clear and relevant, and that the article fits well into them. Also, I need to ensure there&#39;s a balance across categories without overcrowding any single one. Since this is just an initial categorization, I&#39;ll stick with these six for now.
&lt;/think&gt;
