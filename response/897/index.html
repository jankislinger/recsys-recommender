Title: Optimizing Long-term Value for Auction-Based Recommender Systems via On-Policy Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:
Auction-based recommender systems are prevalent in online advertising platforms, but they are typically optimized to allocate recommendation slots based on immediate expected return metrics, neglecting the downstream effects of recommendations on user behavior. In this study, we employ reinforcement learning to optimize for long-term return metrics in an auction-based recommender system. Utilizing temporal difference learning, a fundamental reinforcement learning algorithm, we implement a \textit{one-step policy improvement approach} that biases the system towards recommendations with higher long-term user engagement metrics. This optimizes value over long horizons while maintaining compatibility with the auction framework. Our approach is based on dynamic programming ideas which show that our method provably improves upon the existing auction-based base policy. Through an online A/B test conducted on an auction-based recommender system, which handles billions of impressions and users daily, we empirically establish that our proposed method outperforms the current production system in terms of long-term user engagement metrics.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through both carefully.

The title is &#34;Optimizing Long-term Value for Auction-Based Recommender Systems via On-Policy Reinforcement Learning.&#34; So right away, I can see that the main topics are auction-based recommender systems and reinforcement learning. The focus seems to be on optimizing long-term value, which suggests they&#39;re looking beyond immediate metrics.

Looking at the abstract, it mentions that auction-based recommenders are common in online advertising but are optimized for short-term gains. They use reinforcement learning, specifically temporal difference learning and a one-step policy improvement approach. This method aims to improve user engagement over time while staying compatible with the auction framework. The study also includes an A/B test on a large scale.

So, breaking this down: the article is about recommendation systems, particularly those that are auction-based. It uses reinforcement learning techniques like temporal difference learning and policy iteration. They&#39;re focusing on long-term metrics rather than short-term ones, which relates to aspects of evaluation beyond just accuracy. The real-world application is shown through an A/B test, so that&#39;s a practical implementation.

I should think about the categories mentioned in the guidelines. Family of algorithm: Reinforcement Learning, Temporal Difference Learning, Policy Iteration. Domain-wise, it&#39;s online advertising, but more specifically, auction-based recommendation systems. In terms of recommendation aspects, long-term value optimization and cold start might not apply here since they&#39;re focusing on existing users over time.

Evaluation aspects include beyond accuracy metrics like user engagement over the long term. They also mention real-world applications with A/B testing and user surveys aren&#39;t directly mentioned but the A/B test is a real application. The study&#39;s approach is theoretical, so that&#39;s another category.

I should make sure each article goes into 8-12 categories. Let me list possible ones:

1. Auction-Based Recommender Systems
2. Reinforcement Learning
3. Temporal Difference Learning
4. Policy Iteration (from the one-step policy improvement)
5. Online Advertising as the domain
6. Long-Term Value Optimization
7. Beyond Accuracy in evaluation
8. Real-World Applications (due to A/B testing)
9. On-Policy Reinforcement Learning
10. User Engagement Metrics
11. Dynamic Programming (as they mention using dynamic programming ideas)
12. Theoretical Approach

Wait, is &#34;Theoretical Approach&#34; the best term? Maybe &#34;Methodology: Theoretical Analysis&#34; or something similar, but since it&#39;s a methodological approach in the study, that fits.

I should ensure each category is clear and user-friendly. Also, avoiding categories that are too narrow unless they&#39;re specifically relevant. For example, &#34;Cold Start&#34; isn&#39;t mentioned here, so I can skip that. 

So compiling these into clear, descriptive labels:

- Auction-Based Recommender Systems
- Reinforcement Learning
- Temporal Difference Learning
- Policy Iteration
- Online Advertising
- Long-Term Value Optimization
- Beyond Accuracy
- Real-World Applications
- On-Policy Reinforcement Learning
- User Engagement Metrics
- Dynamic Programming
- Theoretical Approach

That&#39;s 12 categories. They cover the algorithm family, domain, specific recommendation aspects, evaluation criteria, real applications, and methodological approach.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, let&#39;s try to figure out how to categorize this article. The title is &#34;Optimizing Long-term Value for Auction-Based Recommender Systems via On-Policy Reinforcement Learning.&#34; So, first off, it&#39;s about recommender systems, specifically auction-based ones. That makes me think the domain here is online advertising or something related to platforms that use auctions for recommendations.

The abstract talks about using reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize long-term user engagement rather than just immediate returns. They mention temporal difference learning and a one-step policy improvement approach. So, RL techniques are definitely a key part here. Also, the fact that they&#39;re using on-policy methods is important.

They implemented this in an auction-based recommender system, which deals with billions of impressions daily. That&#39;s a real-world application, so I should note that as well. They also conducted an A/B test to measure performance improvements, which ties into evaluation metrics and real-world applications like user engagement.

Looking at the examples given, categories include things like family of algorithms (like Matrix Factorization or Encoder), domains (Books, Movies, Healthcare), specific recommendation aspects (Cold Start), evaluation aspects (Diversity of Recommendations), and real-world applications (A/B Test).

So for this article, the primary category would be &#34;Reinforcement Learning&#34; since that&#39;s the core algorithm they&#39;re using. The family of algorithms is RL here.

The domain seems to be online advertising or auction-based systems, so maybe &#34;Auction-Based Recommender Systems&#34; or a broader category like &#34;Online Advertising.&#34;

They also talk about long-term value and user engagement, which might fall under evaluation metrics. Specifically, it&#39;s about optimizing for metrics beyond immediate accuracy, so perhaps &#34;Beyond Accuracy.&#34;

The mention of real-world applications through A/B testing points to &#34;A/B Test&#34; as another category.

Other possible categories could include &#34;Temporal Difference Learning,&#34; since that&#39;s a specific RL method they used, and &#34;Dynamic Programming,&#34; which is referenced in their approach.

They&#39;re dealing with scalability because the system handles billions of impressions, so &#34;Scalability&#34; might be relevant too. Additionally, since it&#39;s about recommendation systems, &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; is another obvious category.

Putting this all together, I should list these categories: Auction-Based Recommender Systems, Reinforcement Learning, Temporal Difference Learning, Dynamic Programming, Beyond Accuracy, A/B Test, Scalability, and Recommendation Systems.
&lt;/think&gt;

Auction-Based recommender systems, Reinforcement learning, Temporal difference learning, Dynamic programming, Beyond accuracy, A/B test, Scalability, Recommendation systems</code></pre>
