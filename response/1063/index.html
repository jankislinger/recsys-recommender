Title: Scene-wise Adaptive Network for Dynamic Cold-start Scenes Optimization in CTR Prediction
Abstract:
In the realm of modern mobile E-commerce, providing users with nearby commercial service recommendations through location-based online services has become increasingly vital. While machine learning approaches have shown promise in multi-scene recommendation, existing methodologies often struggle to address cold-start problems in unprecedented scenes: the increasing diversity of commercial choices, along with the short online lifespan of scenes, give rise to the complexity of effective recommendations in online and dynamic scenes. In this work, we propose Scene-wise Adaptive Network (SwAN), a novel approach that emphasizes high-performance cold-start online recommendations for new scenes. Our approach introduces several crucial capabilities, including scene similarity learning, user-specific scene transition cognition, scene-specific information construction for the new scene, and enhancing the diverged logical information between scenes. We demonstrate SwAN’s potential to optimize dynamic multi-scene recommendation problems by effectively online handling cold-start recommendations for any newly arrived scenes. More encouragingly, SwAN has been successfully deployed in Company M’s online catering recommendation service, which serves millions of customers per day, and SwAN has achieved a 5.64% CTR index improvement relative to the baselines and a 5.19% increase in daily order volume proportion.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. The title mentions &#34;Scene-wise Adaptive Network&#34; for optimizing dynamic cold-start scenes in CTR prediction. The abstract discusses mobile E-commerce, location-based services, multi-scene recommendations, cold-start problems, and real-world deployment with specific metrics.

First, I&#39;ll break down the main themes. It&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically dealing with cold-start issues when new scenes are introduced. They used a neural network approach called SwAN to handle this problem. The application is in online catering services, so that&#39;s a domain category.

The article also touches on multi-scene recommendations and dynamic scenarios, which are aspects of the recommendation space. Evaluation aspects include CTR improvement and increased order volume, so evaluation metrics are important here.

Looking at the example categories provided, I can map this to several areas:

- Algorithm family: The article uses a neural network, specifically Scene-wise Adaptive Network (SwAN), so &#34;Neural Networks&#34; is appropriate.
- Domain: It&#39;s applied in mobile E-commerce and catering services, so those should be included as separate categories.
- Recommendation aspects: Cold start is a key issue addressed here, so that&#39;s one. Multi-scene recommendations and dynamic scenarios are specific to the recommendation space.
- Evaluation: The improvement in CTR and order volume shows they focused on evaluation metrics beyond just accuracy, hence &#34;Beyond Accuracy.&#34;
- Real-world application: They deployed it in an online service, which fits into real-world applications.

I should also consider broader categories like &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; itself. Since the problem is dynamic and involves multiple scenes, those are additional specific aspects.

To meet the 8-12 categories requirement, I&#39;ll ensure each of these points is covered without overcrowding any category. Clear labels will help users find relevant articles easily.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through them carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Scene-wise Adaptive Network&#34; for &#34;Dynamic Cold-start Scenes Optimization in CTR Prediction.&#34; So the main themes here are cold-start problems, dynamic scenes, and click-through rate (CTR) prediction. It&#39;s applied to mobile e-commerce recommendations, specifically location-based services.

Looking at the abstract: The problem is about providing nearby commercial service recommendations using location-based online services. They talk about challenges with multi-scene recommendation and cold-start issues in new, diverse scenarios that are short-lived. Their solution, SwAN, focuses on handling these dynamic and cold-start situations effectively. It&#39;s deployed in a real-world setting at Company M for catering recommendations.

So the key points I extract are:
1. Cold Start: Definitely a primary focus.
2. Dynamic Scenes: The article addresses optimizing for scenes that change quickly.
3. Multi-scene Recommendation: They handle multiple scenes, which is part of recommendation systems.
4. CTR Prediction: Their approach improves click-through rates.
5. Online Recommendations: It&#39;s about real-time recommendations in e-commerce.
6. Location-based Services: The context is location-dependent services.
7. Real-world Application: It mentions deployment and success metrics (CTR improvement).
8. Scalability: Since it&#39;s used by millions, scalability might be a factor.

I should assign categories that cover these aspects. The user guidelines suggest multiple categories per article, so I&#39;ll pick the most relevant ones from the examples given. Let me list possible categories based on the key points:

- Cold Start (explicitly mentioned)
- Dynamic Scenes (as it&#39;s about optimizing dynamic scenarios)
- Multi-scene Recommendation (they handle multiple scenes)
- CTR Prediction (their main focus is improving this metric)
- Online Recommendations (real-time recommendations in e-commerce)
- Real-world Applications (they deployed the solution and saw improvements)
- Scalability (given the large user base they serve)

I think these categories accurately reflect the article&#39;s content and align with user interests. Each category is specific enough to be useful without being too narrow. Also, considering other possible categories like &#34;Location-based Services&#34; could be relevant, but since it&#39;s more about the application context rather than a core theme, I might prioritize the ones directly tied to recommendation challenges.

I&#39;ll stop here and compile the list.
&lt;/think&gt;

Cold Start, Dynamic Scenes, Multi-scene Recommendation, CTR Prediction, Online Recommendations, Real-world Applications, Scalability</code></pre>
