        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Bundle MCR: Towards Conversational Bundle Recommendation
Abstract:
Bundle recommender systems recommend sets of items (e.g., pants, shirt, and shoes) to users, but they often suffer from two issues: significant interaction sparsity and a large output space. In this work, we extend multi-round conversational recommendation (MCR) to alleviate these issues. MCR—which uses a conversational paradigm to elicit user interests by asking user preferences on tags (e.g., categories or attributes) and handling user feedback across multiple rounds—is an emerging recommendation setting to acquire user feedback and narrow down the output space, but has not been explored in the context of bundle recommendation. In this work, we propose a novel recommendation task named Bundle MCR. Unlike traditional bundle recommendation (a bundle-aware user model and bundle generation), Bundle MCR studies how to encode user feedback as conversation states and how to post questions to users. Unlike existing MCR in which agents recommend individual items only, Bundle MCR handles more complicated user feedback on multiple items and related tags. To support this, we first propose a new framework to formulate Bundle MCR as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with multiple agents, for user modeling, consultation and feedback handling in bundle contexts. Under this framework, we propose a model architecture, called Bundle Bert (Bunt) to (1) recommend items, (2) post questions and (3) manage conversations based on bundle-aware conversation states. Moreover, to train Bunt effectively, we propose a two-stage training strategy. In an offline pre-training stage, Bunt is trained using multiple cloze tasks to mimic bundle interactions in conversations. Then in an online fine-tuning stage, Bunt agents are enhanced by user interactions. Our experiments on multiple offline datasets as well as the human evaluation show the value of extending MCR frameworks to bundle settings and the effectiveness of our Bunt design.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into appropriate categories based on its content. Let&#39;s start by understanding what the article is about.

The title mentions &#34;Bundle MCR: Towards Conversational Bundle Recommendation.&#34; So it&#39;s about recommendation systems but specifically for bundles, which are sets of items like clothes or accessories. The abstract explains that bundle recommenders face issues with interaction sparsity and a large output space. They propose extending multi-round conversational recommendation (MCR) to address these problems.

Looking at the content, they&#39;re talking about conversational recommendation, which is an emerging area where user feedback is gathered through multiple rounds of interaction. This seems different from traditional recommendation systems that might not handle bundles or have multiple rounds of conversation.

The article introduces a new framework using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with multiple agents for user modeling and feedback handling in bundle contexts. They also developed a model called Bundle Bert (Bunt), which handles recommending items, posting questions, and managing conversations based on bundle-aware states. The training strategy is two-stage: offline pre-training with cloze tasks and online fine-tuning.

Now, mapping this to the categories:

1. **Bundle Recommendation**: This is directly about bundles.
2. **Conversational Recommender Systems**: They&#39;re extending MCR into conversational settings.
3. **Multi-Round Conversational Recommendation (MCR)**: Specifically mentioned in the title and abstract.
4. **User Feedback Handling**: They discuss encoding user feedback as conversation states.
5. **Recommender Systems**: General category, fits here.
6. **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**: Used in their framework.
7. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Mentioned in the MDPs context with multiple agents.
8. **Conversation State Management**: Managing conversations is a key aspect.
9. **Cold Start**: Since bundle recommenders have interaction sparsity, this might be relevant.
10. **Human Evaluation**: They conducted human evaluations to test their model.

Other possible categories could include &#34;Multi-Item Recommendation,&#34; but it&#39;s similar to bundle recommendation. Maybe &#34;Tag-Based Recommendations&#34; since they use tags like categories or attributes in the conversational process. Also, &#34;Scalability&#34; is touched upon as a concern with large output spaces, so that fits too.

I should ensure each category is relevant and not redundant. The user guidelines suggest 8-12 categories, so I&#39;ll include all the above but maybe drop some if they overlap. However, since each seems distinct, it&#39;s okay to have more.
&lt;/think&gt;
