        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Horizontal Cross-Silo Federated Recommender Systems
Abstract:
Recommender systems (RSs) completely rely on the knowledge of training information to generate recommendations. However, due to privacy, ownership, and protection of usersâ€™ information, such training information is not easily accessible or shared with an RS. Moreover, with recent regulations in privacy laws (e.g, GDPR), collecting user preferences and perform centralized training may not be feasible. Federated Learning (FL) is a form of machine learning technique where the goal is to learn a high-quality recommendation model without never directly accessing raw training data. In this work, we specifically focus on situations where multiple stakeholders (referred to as corporate companies like e-commerce business partners, hospitals, banks, news media publishers) participate in federated learning to build a shared recommendation model. We performed offline experiments by simulating a real federated learning setup and investigated the benefits federated learning brings to stakeholders in terms of ranking compared to an RS model trained without participating in federated learning. Our experimental results reveal that stakeholders can significantly benefit from federated learning to generate accurate recommendations. Moreover, we also study the use and benefits of federated learning in situations when there are not enough preferences available for users.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Horizontal Cross-Silo Federated Recommender Systems&#34; into multiple relevant categories. Let&#39;s start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Federated Recommender Systems,&#34; which tells me it&#39;s about recommendation systems that use federated learning. The abstract goes on to explain that recommender systems rely on training data but face challenges with privacy, ownership, and regulations like GDPR. They propose using Federated Learning (FL) as a solution where multiple stakeholders collaborate without sharing raw data.

So the core themes here are Recommender Systems, Federated Learning, Privacy, and Cross-Silo collaboration among different entities like e-commerce businesses, hospitals, banks, etc.

Let me break this down:

1. **Federated Learning**: This is a key aspect because the paper focuses on building recommendation models using FL.
2. **Recommender Systems**: The primary application area of the research.
3. **Privacy-Preserving Techniques**: Important due to GDPR and other regulations mentioned.
4. **Cross-Silo Collaboration**: Since multiple stakeholders are involved, this is a specific aspect in the recommendation space.
5. **Horizontal Federated Learning**: A type of FL where participants have similar data distributions but different data.
6. **Stakeholder Benefits**: The paper discusses how different entities benefit from using FL.
7. **Decentralized Recommendation**: Opposite of centralized systems, which is a big point here.
8. **User Privacy Protection**: Directly related to the challenges addressed in the abstract.
9. **Multi-Party Collaboration**: Another way to describe cross-silo efforts involving multiple parties.

I should make sure these categories cover both broad areas (like Recommender Systems) and specific aspects (like Horizontal Federated Learning). I also need to ensure that each category is user-friendly and clear, avoiding overly technical jargon unless necessary. Additionally, considering the user-centric design, including terms like &#34;Stakeholder Benefits&#34; helps users interested in practical applications.

I think this covers all the main points from the abstract without overlapping too much. Let me double-check if there&#39;s anything else I might have missed. The paper also mentions experiments showing benefits in ranking and handling cases with insufficient preferences, but those are more about evaluation rather than categorization. Maybe &#34;Evaluation of Recommendation Models&#34; could be another category, but since the guidelines suggest using existing categories unless necessary, I&#39;ll stick to what&#39;s already listed.

So, compiling all these thoughts into a list of categories that accurately reflect the article&#39;s content and align with user needs.
&lt;/think&gt;
