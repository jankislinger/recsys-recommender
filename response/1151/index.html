        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Bootstrapping Conditional Retrieval for User-to-Item Recommendations
Abstract:
User-to-item retrieval has been an active research area in recommendation system, and two tower models are widely adopted due to model simplicity and serving efficiency. In this work, we focus on a variant called conditional retrieval, where we expect retrieved items to be relevant to a condition (e.g. topic). We propose a method that uses the same training data as standard two tower models but incorporates item side information as conditions in query. This allows us to bootstrap new conditional retrieval use cases and encourages feature interactions between user and condition. Experiments show that our method can retrieve highly relevant items and out-performed standard two tower models with filters on engagement metrics. The proposed model is deployed to power a topic-based notification feed at Pinterest and led to +0.26% weekly active users.

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about user-to-item recommendations using conditional retrieval. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the title mentions &#34;Bootstrapping Conditional Retrieval for User-to-Item Recommendations.&#34; That immediately tells me it&#39;s related to recommendation systems and a specific technique called conditional retrieval.

Looking at the abstract, they talk about two-tower models being widely used. So that&#39;s another category right there—Two-Tower Models. The article proposes a method that uses the same training data but incorporates item side information as conditions in the query. This suggests it&#39;s enhancing traditional methods with additional features or conditions.

They mention experiments where their method outperforms standard two-tower models, especially when considering engagement metrics. So aspects like Performance Comparison and Engagement Metrics are relevant categories.

The deployment part is important too. The model was used in a real-world application at Pinterest for a topic-based notification feed, which increased weekly active users by 0.26%. This points to Real-World Applications and User Growth as applicable categories.

Since the focus is on conditional retrieval, that&#39;s another key category. It’s also part of recommendation systems, so that should be included. The use of item side information implies they&#39;re leveraging Side Information in their model, which is a specific aspect within recommendation techniques.

The paper discusses feature interactions between users and conditions, which touches on Feature Interaction, an important aspect in model design. Additionally, since they mention scalability and serving efficiency as reasons for using two-tower models, Scalability is another relevant category.

Putting it all together, the categories should cover both the specific techniques used (Conditional Retrieval, Two-Tower Models) as well as broader areas like Recommendation Systems. They also address performance metrics, real-world impacts, and aspects of model design and scalability.
&lt;/think&gt;
