Title: Towards Self-Explaining Sequence-Aware Recommendation
Abstract:
Self-explaining models are becoming an important perk of recommender systems, as they help users understand the reason behind certain recommendations, which encourages them to interact more often with the platform. In order to personalize recommendations, modern recommender approaches make the model aware of the user behavior history for interest evolution representation. However, existing explainable recommender systems do not consider the past user history to further personalize the explanation based on the user interest fluctuation. In this work, we propose a SEQuence-Aware Explainable Recommendation model (SEQUER) that is able to leverage the sequence of user-item review interactions to generate better explanations while maintaining recommendation performance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposal on multiple recommendation scenarios. Our source code and preprocessed datasets are available at https://tinyurl.com/SEQUER-RECSYS23.

Alright, I&#39;m looking at this article titled &#34;Towards Self-Explaining Sequence-Aware Recommendation&#34; with an abstract that talks about making recommender systems more transparent by personalizing explanations based on user history. So, my goal is to categorize it into 8-12 relevant categories as per the guidelines.

First, the core theme seems to be explainable recommendation systems. That&#39;s a key area because it&#39;s about transparency in recommendations. Then, since the model considers user behavior over time, I&#39;ll include sequence-aware modeling and temporal dynamics. These are important aspects of how recommendations are generated by understanding past interactions.

Next, the article mentions leveraging user-item review interactions for better explanations, so that points to user interaction data as another category. The focus on personalized explanations leads me to think about personalization in recommendations and also the aspect of human factors because it&#39;s about how users interact with and understand the system.

The abstract states that the model maintains recommendation performance while improving explanations, which ties into recommendation performance metrics. Additionally, since they&#39;re using sequences, I should consider sequential recommendation as another category. The availability of source code and datasets suggests real-world applications, so A/B testing isn&#39;t directly mentioned but related to implementation aspects.

I also think about evaluation criteria because the article mentions experiments validating effectiveness across scenarios. Beyond accuracy might be relevant here as it&#39;s not just about how accurate recommendations are but also their explainability and user engagement. The approach is technical, involving models that handle sequences, so model interpretability and recommendation techniques fit well.

Putting this all together, I have categories like Explainable Recommendation Systems, Sequence-Aware Modeling, Personalized Explanations, User Interaction Data, etc. Each of these captures different facets of the article, ensuring it&#39;s discoverable under various user search behaviors and interests.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Towards Self-Explaining Sequence-Aware Recommendation&#34;. Let me read through the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions self-explaining models in recommender systems. That suggests it&#39;s about explainability in recommendations. The abstract talks about how these models help users understand recommendations, which is important for user interaction. It also points out that current systems don&#39;t personalize explanations based on user interest history.

The article introduces SEQUER, a model that uses sequence of user-item interactions to improve explanations while keeping recommendation performance up. They tested it in multiple scenarios and made data available.

So, I&#39;ll start by identifying the main themes. Explainability is central here, so &#34;Explainable Recommender Systems&#34; should be a category. The model&#39;s awareness of user behavior sequences makes me think of Sequence-Aware Models as another category.

Looking at the problem domain, it&#39;s about recommendations, so &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; is definitely relevant. The focus on personalizing explanations based on user history points to Personalization and User-Centered Design.

The aspect of using interaction history suggests it&#39;s related to User Behavior Analysis. Also, the evaluation probably looked into factors like recommendation performance, which ties into Evaluation Metrics.

Since the model leverages sequences, Temporal Aspects in Recommendations is another category. The goal is better explanations, so Explanation Quality should be included.

Lastly, because it&#39;s a novel approach addressing existing gaps, it falls under Innovation in Recommender Systems.

I need to make sure each category is clear and relevant, covering both specific aspects like explainability and broader areas like recommendation systems. That should cover all key points from the abstract.
&lt;/think&gt;
