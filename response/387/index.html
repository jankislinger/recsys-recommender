Title: StreamingRec: A Framework for Benchmarking Stream-based News Recommenders
Abstract:
News is one of the earliest application domains of recommender systems, and recommending items from a virtually endless stream of news is still a relevant problem today. News recommendation is different from other application domains in a variety of ways, e.g., because new items constantly become available for recommendation. To be effective, news recommenders therefore have to continuously consider the latest items in the incoming stream of news in their recommendation models. However, todayâ€™s public software libraries for algorithm benchmarking mostly do not consider these particularities of the domain. As a result, authors often rely on proprietary protocols, which hampers the comparability of the obtained results. In this paper, we present StreamingRec as a framework for evaluating streaming-based news recommenders in a replicable way. The open-source framework implements a replay-based evaluation protocol that allows algorithms to update the underlying models in real-time when new events are recorded and new articles are available for recommendation. Furthermore, a variety of baseline algorithms for session-based recommendation are part of StreamingRec. For these, we also report a number of performance results for two datasets, which confirm the importance of immediate model updates.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article about StreamingRec into multiple relevant categories. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;StreamingRec: A Framework for Benchmarking Stream-based News Recommenders.&#34; So right away, I can see that it&#39;s related to recommendation systems, specifically in the news domain. The framework is designed for benchmarking, so evaluation must be a key aspect here.

Looking at the abstract, it talks about news being an early application of recommender systems but still relevant today because new items are constantly available. This implies continuous learning or real-time updates are important. The article addresses that current libraries don&#39;t account for these specific needs in news recommendation, leading to reliance on proprietary protocols which hinder comparability.

The authors present StreamingRec as an open-source framework with a replay-based evaluation protocol. This suggests it&#39;s about methodology and providing tools for others to use. They also mention baseline algorithms for session-based recommendations, so that&#39;s another category. Performance results are reported using two datasets, highlighting the practical application of their work.

So, breaking this down:

1. **Recommendation Systems**: The primary area since the paper is about recommenders.
2. **News**: Specifically targeting news as the domain.
3. **Streaming**: Because it deals with real-time or continuous data streams.
4. **Benchmarking**: Since the framework evaluates algorithms.
5. **Open Source**: They&#39;ve developed an open-source tool, which is a key point.
6. **Evaluation Protocol**: The methodology used for evaluation.
7. **Continuous Learning**: Due to the need for model updates as new articles come in.
8. **Session-based Recommendations**: As they provide baseline algorithms in this area.

I should also consider whether there are any aspects like real-world applications or aspects of evaluation beyond accuracy, but the abstract doesn&#39;t explicitly mention user surveys or A/B tests, so maybe not. It&#39;s more about methodology and framework development. 

Other possible categories could be &#34;Framework&#34; itself, since they developed a tool, and &#34;Algorithm Comparison&#34; because it compares different methods. But I think sticking to the ones mentioned in the guidelines would be better.

So compiling these thoughts, the relevant categories are: Streaming Recommenders, News, Benchmarking Frameworks, Open Source Tools, Real-time Processing, Continuous Learning, Session-based Recommendations, Algorithm Evaluation.
&lt;/think&gt;

Streaming Recommenders, News, Benchmarking Frameworks, Open Source Tools, Real-time Processing, Continuous Learning, Session-based Recommendations, Algorithm Evaluation</code></pre>

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article called &#34;StreamingRec: A Framework for Benchmarking Stream-based News Recommenders.&#34; The user has given me some guidelines on how to do this effectively. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title tells me that it&#39;s about a framework for evaluating stream-based news recommenders. So, it&#39;s related to recommendation systems in the context of streaming news. The abstract adds more details: it mentions that news is an early application domain for recommender systems, but the challenge is handling the constant influx of new items. Current benchmarking libraries don&#39;t account for these stream-based specifics, leading authors to use proprietary methods which aren&#39;t comparable.

The paper introduces StreamingRec, a framework for evaluating streaming news recommenders in a reproducible way. It uses a replay-based evaluation protocol where models can update in real-time as new events and articles come in. They also included baseline algorithms for session-based recommendations and tested performance on two datasets, showing the importance of immediate model updates.

Now, considering the categorization guidelines, I need to assign at least 8-12 categories. Let&#39;s break down the key elements:

1. **Streaming News Recommenders**: This is central to the article. It&#39;s about handling streams of news content for recommendations.
2. **Reproducibility**: The framework allows for replicable evaluations, so reproducibility is a key aspect.
3. **Benchmarking Frameworks**: Since StreamingRec is a benchmarking tool, this category fits.
4. **Stream-based Algorithms**: The algorithms operate in real-time with streams of data.
5. **Session-Based Recommendations**: They mention session-based recommendation as part of the baseline algorithms.
6. **Real-Time Updates**: The models update immediately when new events occur.
7. **Evaluation Protocol**: The paper discusses an evaluation protocol, specifically replay-based.
8. **News Recommendation Domain**: It&#39;s within the news domain, which has unique challenges compared to other domains.
9. **Proprietary Protocols**: They talk about authors relying on these, so it&#39;s relevant but maybe not as central.
10. **Algorithm Benchmarking**: This ties into evaluating different recommendation algorithms.

Wait, I need to ensure each category is clear and useful. Some of the points might overlap or be too specific. Let me refine this:

- Reproducibility: Important for researchers wanting to replicate studies.
- Stream-based News Recommenders: Core focus.
- Benchmarking Frameworks: General but applicable here.
- Real-Time Processing: Since it&#39;s about updating models as new data comes in.
- Session-Based Recommendations: A specific type of recommendation method used.
- Evaluation Protocol: The method used for assessing the framework&#39;s effectiveness.
- Open Source: StreamingRec is open-source, which is a key point.
- News Domain: Focuses on news recommendation challenges.

I think that covers it. Let me make sure each category is distinct and relevant. Maybe &#34;Open Source&#34; should be included since the framework is open-source. Also, &#34;Reproducibility&#34; is crucial for the evaluation aspect. I&#39;ll list them to ensure they are all covered without redundancy.
&lt;/think&gt;

- Reproducibility
- Stream-based News Recommenders
- Benchmarking Frameworks
