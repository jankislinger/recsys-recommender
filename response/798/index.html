        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Recommender Systems and Algorithmic Hate
Abstract:
Despite increasing reliance on personalization in digital platforms, many algorithms that curate content or information for users have been met with resistance. When users feel dissatisfied or harmed by recommendations, this can lead users to hate, or feel negatively towards these personalized systems. Algorithmic hate detrimentally impacts both users and the system, and can result in various forms of algorithmic harm, or in extreme cases can lead to public protests against “the algorithm” in question. In this work, we summarize some of the most common causes of algorithmic hate and their negative consequences through various case studies of personalized recommender systems. We explore promising future directions for the RecSys research community that could help alleviate algorithmic hate and improve the relationship between recommender systems and their users.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about Recommender Systems and Algorithmic Hate. Let&#39;s start by reading through the title and abstract again to get a clear idea of what it&#39;s about.

The title mentions &#34;Recommender Systems&#34; and &#34;Algorithmic Hate.&#34; The abstract explains that even though digital platforms rely more on personalization, users often resist these algorithms. When recommendations make users feel dissatisfied or harmed, they develop algorithmic hate, which can lead to negative impacts on both users and the system. There are examples of public protests against specific algorithms.

So, first, I should identify the main themes here. The primary focus is on recommender systems, so that&#39;s a key category. Then, it&#39;s about how these systems cause user dissatisfaction or harm, which leads to &#34;algorithmic hate.&#34; That term isn&#39;t commonly used, but it relates to negative user experiences and trust issues.

Looking at the examples of categories provided, I can consider several areas:

1. **Algorithm Design**: Since it discusses how algorithms curate content and their effects on users.
2. **User Experience (UX)**: Because the focus is on how users feel about recommendations.
3. **Ethics in AI/ML**: The article touches on ethical issues arising from algorithmic recommendations.
4. **Trust Issues**: Users losing trust in recommendation systems.
5. **Algorithmic Harm**: Directly related to negative consequences of algorithms.
6. **Algorithmic Transparency**: If the lack of transparency leads to distrust, this could be relevant.
7. **Case Studies**: The article uses case studies as examples, so that&#39;s a good category.
8. **Public Perception**: How the public views and reacts against recommendation systems.
9. **User Trust**: Another way to look at trust issues specifically in user context.

I should ensure each article is assigned 8-12 categories. Let me check if there are more applicable ones:

- **Ethical Considerations**: Similar to ethics but perhaps broader.
- **Personalization Issues**: Since personalization can lead to dissatisfaction.
- **Negative User Feedback**: Users expressing hate or negative feelings towards the system.

I should avoid creating too many similar categories, so maybe stick with &#34;Algorithmic Harm&#34; instead of a separate one for negative feedback. Also, considering dynamic updates and user-centric design, ensuring that these categories make sense for someone looking into recommender systems and their societal impacts.

I think I have around 9-10 relevant categories here. Let me list them out to see if they cover the necessary aspects without overlapping too much.
&lt;/think&gt;

Algorithm Design, User Experience (UX), Ethics in AI/ML, Trust Issues, Algorithmic Harm, Case Studies, Public Perception, User Trust, Ethical Considerations, Personalization Issues</code></pre>
