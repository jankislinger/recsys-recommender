        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Effective User Interface Designs to Increase Energy-efficient Behavior in a Rasch-based Energy Recommender System
Abstract:
People often struggle to find appropriate energy-saving measures to take in the household. Although recommender studies show that tailoring a system’s interaction method to the domain knowledge of the user can increase energy savings, they did not actually tailor the conservation advice itself. We present two large user studies in which we support users to make an energy-efficient behavioral change by presenting tailored energy-saving advice. Both systems use a one-dimensional, ordinal Rasch scale, which orders 79 energy-saving measures on their behavioral difficulty and link this to a user’s energy-saving ability for tailored advice. We established that recommending Rasch-based advice can reduce a user’s effort, increase system support and, in turn, increase choice satisfaction and lead to the adoption of more energy-saving measures. Moreover, follow-up surveys four weeks later point out that tailoring advice on its feasibility can lead to behavioral change.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its content. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is about &#34;Effective User Interface Designs&#34; aimed at increasing energy-efficient behavior in a Rasch-based Energy Recommender System. So, right away, I can note that it&#39;s related to user interface design, energy efficiency, and recommendation systems.

Looking at the abstract, they mention two large user studies where they tailored conservation advice using a one-dimensional ordinal Rasch scale. This tailoring helps users make energy-efficient changes by presenting them with measures ordered by difficulty. The results show that this approach reduces effort, increases satisfaction, and leads to more adoption of energy-saving measures.

So breaking this down, the article discusses:

1. User Interface Design: It&#39;s about how the UI is designed to influence user behavior towards saving energy.
2. Energy Efficiency: The focus is on encouraging users to adopt energy-saving behaviors.
3. Recommender Systems: They use a Rasch-based system to provide recommendations tailored to each user.
4. User Studies: They conducted experiments with real users to test their approach.
5. Behavioral Change: The goal is to influence or change user behavior towards more sustainable practices.
6. Personalization/Tailoring: The advice given is personalized based on the user&#39;s energy-saving ability as measured by the Rasch scale.
7. Evaluation: The study evaluates the effectiveness of this approach through follow-up surveys and measures like effort reduction, satisfaction, and adoption rates.
8. Sustainability: This ties into broader themes of sustainability and environmental impact.

I should also consider if there are other relevant categories. It mentions A/B testing indirectly since they have two studies, but it&#39;s more about user studies than traditional A/B testing. The evaluation aspect is covered under Aspects of Evaluation, so I think that&#39;s sufficient.

Putting it all together, the categories should include aspects like User Interface Design, Energy Efficiency, Recommender Systems, User Studies, Behavioral Change, Personalization or Tailoring, and Evaluation. Sustainability might be a broader category that encapsulates the energy efficiency aspect.
&lt;/think&gt;
