Title: Uplift-based Evaluation and Optimization of Recommenders
Abstract:
Recommender systems aim to increase user actions such as clicks and purchases. Typical evaluations of recommenders regard the purchase of a recommended item as a success. However, the item may have been purchased even without the recommendation. An uplift is defined as an increase in user actions caused by recommendations. Situations with and without a recommendation cannot both be observed for a specific user-item pair at a given time instance, making uplift-based evaluation and optimization challenging. This paper proposes new evaluation metrics and optimization methods for the uplift in a recommender system. We apply a causal inference framework to estimate the average uplift for the offline evaluation of recommenders. Our evaluation protocol leverages both purchase and recommendation logs under a currently deployed recommender system, to simulate the cases both with and without recommendations. This enables the offline evaluation of the uplift for newly generated recommendation lists. For optimization, we need to define positive and negative samples that are specific to an uplift-based approach. For this purpose, we deduce four classes of items by observing purchase and recommendation logs. We derive the relative priorities among these four classes in terms of the uplift and use them to construct both pointwise and pairwise sampling methods for uplift optimization. Through dedicated experiments with three public datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization methods in improving the uplift.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Uplift- based Evaluation and Optimization of Recommenders.&#34; Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.

The title suggests that the focus is on evaluating and optimizing recommenders using uplift. From what I remember, uplift in recommendation systems refers to measuring the actual impact a recommendation has on user actions, beyond just whether they made a purchase or not. The abstract mentions that typical evaluations consider a purchase as success but don&#39;t account for whether the recommendation caused it. That makes sense because sometimes users might buy something even without seeing a recommendation.

The paper proposes new metrics and optimization methods using causal inference. They talk about leveraging both purchase and recommendation logs to simulate scenarios with and without recommendations, which is interesting. This helps in evaluating how much the recommendation actually contributed to the user&#39;s action. 

They also discuss defining positive and negative samples for uplift-based approaches, deducing four classes of items from purchase and recommendation data. These classes help prioritize optimization methods that target improving the actual impact (uplift) rather than just accuracy. The experiments on public datasets show effectiveness in improving uplift.

Now, thinking about categorization. Let&#39;s break down the key elements:

1. **Evaluation Metrics**: They&#39;re introducing new metrics for evaluation.
2. **Causal Inference**: Using a causal framework to estimate uplift.
3. **Offline Evaluation**: Using logs to simulate scenarios without recommendations.
4. **Optimization Methods**: Developing pointwise and pairwise sampling methods specific to uplift.
5. **Uplift Modeling**: Focus on measuring the actual impact of recommendations.
6. **Recommendation Systems**: The primary area is recommender systems.
7. **User-Centric Evaluation**: Since uplift considers user behavior beyond just purchases.

Looking at the categories from the examples provided:

- **Algorithm Family**: Causal Inference, maybe something else like Uplift Modeling?
- **Evaluation Aspects**: Beyond Accuracy (since it&#39;s about uplift), and Offline Evaluation.
- **Recommendation-Specific Terms: Cold Start might not apply here. Maybe something like Impact Measurement or Uplift-Based Methods.
- **Real-world Applications**: The paper uses real logs but doesn&#39;t mention A/B tests or user surveys, so maybe just Real World Data?
  
Wait, the abstract mentions using both purchase and recommendation logs under a deployed system for evaluation, which implies real-world data is involved. So that&#39;s another category.

Also, since they&#39;re focusing on how recommendations cause changes in user actions, this relates to Causal Analysis or Causal Inference as an aspect of the recommendation process.

The methods involve optimization techniques tailored for uplift, so maybe a category like Uplift Optimization would fit, but looking at examples, there&#39;s &#34;Scalability&#34; and others. Alternatively, since they&#39;re talking about specific evaluation aspects beyond just accuracy, &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; is appropriate.

I should also consider broader categories: the paper is definitely about Recommender Systems, Evaluation Metrics, and User Behavior Analysis since it deals with how users respond to recommendations.

Putting this together, I can assign multiple relevant categories. Let me list potential ones:

- Uplift Modeling
- Causal Inference
- Recommendation Systems
- Evaluation Metrics
- Offline Evaluation
- Beyond Accuracy
- Optimization Methods
- Real World Data

Are there any others? The paper doesn&#39;t mention scalability issues or specific domains like Books or Movies, so those might not be relevant. It&#39;s more about the methodology in evaluation and optimization.

So, final categories would include these points, ensuring each is clear and user-friendly.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Uplift-based Evaluation and Optimization of Recommenders.&#34; Let me read through the abstract carefully.

The article talks about recommender systems aiming to increase user actions like clicks or purchases. It points out that traditional evaluations consider a purchase as successful even if it wasn&#39;t influenced by the recommendation. The key here is uplift, which refers to the actual increase in user actions caused by recommendations. 

The authors mention that observing both scenarios (with and without a recommendation) for the same user-item pair is challenging because you can&#39;t test both at the same time instance. They propose new evaluation metrics and optimization methods using causal inference for offline evaluation.

They use purchase and recommendation logs from an existing system to simulate situations where recommendations were present or not, allowing them to evaluate uplift offline. For optimization, they define specific positive and negative samples tailored to uplift-based approaches, categorizing items into four classes based on logs. These categories are used to create sampling methods that prioritize items with higher uplift impact.

The experiments show their approach effectively improves uplift across three public datasets.

Now, considering the categorization guidelines: each article should go into 8-12 categories. Let&#39;s break down the key elements of the paper.

Firstly, it&#39;s about recommender systems, so &#34;Recommender Systems&#34; is a primary category. The focus is on evaluation methods, specifically uplift-based metrics, so that&#39;s another one: &#34;Uplift-Based Evaluation.&#34; They used causal inference, which ties into &#34;Causal Inference.&#34;

The optimization aspect suggests they looked at improving recommendation models, so &#34;Optimization Methods&#34; fits here. Since they worked with logs from real systems, &#34;Offline Evaluation&#34; is relevant too.

They also discussed the challenge of simulating scenarios without recommendations, which falls under &#34;A/B Testing&#34; because it&#39;s about testing different conditions to measure effects. The paper deals with user actions like clicks and purchases, so including &#34;User Behavior Analysis&#34; makes sense.

They used public datasets for experiments, so &#34;Public Datasets&#34; should be a category. Scalability is mentioned implicitly as they aim to optimize uplift across systems, but the abstract doesn&#39;t explicitly talk about scalability limits or techniques, so maybe not the best fit. Instead, perhaps &#34;Evaluation Metrics&#34; since they introduced new metrics.

They touched on real-world applications because they used existing recommendation logs and aimed for practical optimization methods. That&#39;s &#34;Real-World Applications.&#34; Lastly, since their approach impacts how recommendations are delivered to improve user actions, &#34;Recommendation Delivery&#34; is a good fit.

I&#39;m thinking of 8 categories, but let me check if I can add more without being too redundant. &#34;Causal Inference,&#34; &#34;Offline Evaluation,&#34; and &#34;A/B Testing&#34; seem distinct enough. Maybe &#34;Evaluation Protocol&#34; could be another, but that might overlap with existing terms. Alternatively, considering the problem domain is recommendation systems, so sticking to broader categories like &#34;Recommender Systems&#34; covers it.

I&#39;ll list out the potential categories:

1. Recommender Systems
2. Uplift-Based Evaluation
3. Causal Inference
4. Optimization Methods
5. Offline Evaluation
6. A/B Testing
7. User Behavior Analysis
8. Public Datasets

That&#39;s eight, which meets the minimum guideline. I don&#39;t see a strong need to add more without making them too specific or overlapping.
&lt;/think&gt;

1. Recommender Systems  
2. Uplift-Based Evaluation  
3. Causal Inference  
4. Optimization Methods  
5. Offline Evaluation  
6. A/B Testing  
7. User Behavior Analysis  
8. Public Datasets</code></pre>
