        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Learning to Collaborate in Multi-Module Recommendation via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning without Communication
Abstract:
With the rise of online e-commerce platforms, more and more customers prefer to shop online. To sell more products, online platforms introduce various modules to recommend items with different properties such as huge discounts. A web page often consists of different independent modules. The ranking policies of these modules are decided by different teams and optimized individually without cooperation, which might result in competition between modules. Thus, the global policy of the whole page could be sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent cooperative reinforcement learning approach with the restriction that different modules cannot communicate. Our contributions are three-fold. Firstly, inspired by a solution concept in game theory named correlated equilibrium, we design a signal network to promote cooperation of all modules by generating signals (vectors) for different modules. Secondly, an entropy-regularized version of the signal network is proposed to coordinate agentsâ€™ exploration of the optimal global policy. Furthermore, experiments based on real-world e-commerce data demonstrate that our algorithm obtains superior performance over baselines.

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about recommendation systems using multi-agent reinforcement learning. The title mentions &#34;Learning to Collaborate in Multi-Module Recommendation via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning without Communication.&#34; From the abstract, it talks about online e-commerce platforms with multiple independent modules that recommend different items but don&#39;t communicate, leading to suboptimal global policies. They propose a solution using game theory&#39;s correlated equilibrium concept and signal networks to promote cooperation.

First, I need to break down the key elements here. The main topics are recommendation systems, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and collaboration without communication. The problem is in e-commerce, so that&#39;s a domain category. They mention modules on web pages, which relates to user interfaces or web systems. 

They use techniques like correlated equilibrium from game theory, so that should be another category. Multi-agent systems are clearly relevant since the method involves multiple agents. Reinforcement learning is the primary technique used here, so that&#39;s another category. The focus is on optimizing recommendation policies globally without communication, which ties into optimization strategies.

The approach uses a signal network to generate signals for modules, which might relate to signaling in game theory or network-based methods. They also mention entropy regularization, which is an aspect of reinforcement learning techniques used to encourage exploration. 

The experiments are based on real-world e-commerce data, so that indicates practical applications and A/B testing or user surveys could be involved, but the abstract doesn&#39;t specify if they did A/B tests or user surveys; it just mentions real-world data. So maybe include Real-World Applications as a category.

Considering the evaluation aspects, the paper shows superior performance over baselines, which suggests they focused on evaluation metrics beyond just accuracy, possibly looking at how diverse the recommendations are or other factors. So categories like Evaluation Metrics and Beyond Accuracy make sense.

Putting it all together, I need to assign 8-12 categories that cover these elements: recommendation systems, multi-agent RL, e-commerce domain, game theory concepts, reinforcement learning techniques, modules (which could relate to web systems), optimization without communication, signaling networks, entropy regularization, real-world applications, evaluation metrics beyond accuracy, and collaboration strategies.

I should make sure the categories are clear and user-friendly. Some might be overlapping, but that&#39;s okay as long as they accurately reflect the content. For example, &#34;Multi-Agent Systems&#34; and &#34;Collaboration Strategies&#34; both apply here.
&lt;/think&gt;
