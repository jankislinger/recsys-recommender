        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Looks Can Be Deceiving: Linking User-Item Interactions and User’s Propensity Towards Multi-Objective Recommendations
Abstract:
Multi-objective recommender systems (MORS) provide suggestions to users according to multiple (and possibly conflicting) goals. When a system optimizes its results at the individual-user level, it tailors them on a user’s propensity towards the different objectives. Hence, the capability to understand users’ fine-grained needs towards each goal is crucial. In this paper, we present the results of a user study in which we monitored the way users interacted with recommended items, as well as their self-proclaimed propensities towards relevance, novelty and diversity objectives. The study was divided into several sessions, where users evaluated recommendation lists originating from a relevance-only single-objective baseline as well as MORS. We show that despite MORS-based recommendations attracted less selections, its presence in the early sessions is crucial for users’ satisfaction in the later stages. Surprisingly, the self-proclaimed willingness of users to interact with novel and diverse items is not always reflected in the recommendations they accept. Post-study questionnaires provide insights on how to deal with this matter, suggesting that MORS-based results should be accompanied by elements that allow users to understand the recommendations, so as to facilitate their acceptance.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. The title is &#34;Looks Can Be Deceiving: Linking User-Item Interactions and User’s Propensity Towards Multi-Objective Recommendations.&#34; The abstract talks about multi-objective recommender systems (MORS), which provide suggestions considering multiple goals that might conflict. It mentions a user study where they looked at how users interact with recommendations, both from MORS and a relevance-only baseline.

So first, I should identify the main themes here. Multi-Objective Recommendations is definitely one category since it&#39;s central to the study. The abstract discusses user-item interactions, so that&#39;s another category. They also talk about user propensity towards different objectives like relevance, novelty, and diversity, so User Propensity makes sense.

The study involved a user evaluation with multiple sessions, which means Evaluation is relevant. The findings suggest that while MORS recommendations were selected less initially, they improved satisfaction later on. This touches on User Satisfaction as an aspect. There&#39;s also a discussion about how users&#39; self-reported preferences didn&#39;t always match their selections, indicating a focus on User Preferences.

They used questionnaires post-study to get insights, so Questionnaire-Based Evaluation is another category. The recommendations had different objectives (relevance, novelty, diversity), which ties into Recommendation Objectives. Since the study compares MORS with a single-objective baseline, Multi-Objective Optimization is also relevant.

The research aims to improve recommendation systems by making MORS results more understandable to users, so User-Centered Design fits here. Additionally, since it&#39;s about how different objectives affect user interaction and satisfaction, Beyond Accuracy (as in considering factors beyond just accuracy) is appropriate.

I should ensure these categories are clear and cover both the technical aspects (like MORS, Multi-Objective Optimization) and the user-centric elements (User Satisfaction, User Preferences). Each category should help users find related articles easily. I think 10 categories is a good balance for discoverability without being too overwhelming.
&lt;/think&gt;

Multi-Objective Recommendations, User-item Interactions, User Propensity, Evaluation, User Satisfaction, User Preferences, Questionnaire-Based Evaluation, Recommendation Objectives, Multi-Objective Optimization, User-Centered Design, Beyond Accuracy</code></pre>
