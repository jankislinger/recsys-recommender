        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Model Size Reduction Using Frequency Based Double Hashing for Recommender Systems
Abstract:
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with sparse input features have been widely used in recommender systems in industry. These models have large memory requirements and need a huge amount of training data. The large model size usually entails a cost, in the range of millions of dollars, for storage and communication with the inference services. In this paper, we propose a hybrid hashing method to combine frequency hashing and double hashing techniques for model size reduction, without compromising performance. We evaluate the proposed models on two product surfaces. In both cases, experiment results demonstrated that we can reduce the model size by around 90 while keeping the performance on par with the original baselines.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article about Model Size Reduction Using Frequency Based Double Hashing for Recommender Systems. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Model Size Reduction&#34; and &#34;Double Hashing,&#34; so those are key points. The abstract talks about Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with sparse input features, which are used in recommender systems. It also discusses the large memory requirements and costs associated with storage and communication for inference services. The solution proposed is a hybrid hashing method combining frequency hashing and double hashing to reduce model size without affecting performance.

First, I should identify the main themes. The article is about optimizing models in recommender systems, specifically reducing their size. It uses hashing techniques, so categories like Model Optimization, Model Compression, Hashing Techniques come to mind. Since it&#39;s about recommendation systems, Recommender Systems is a primary category.

The method involves deep neural networks and sparse features, which are aspects of machine learning models. So, Deep Learning and Sparse Features are relevant. The evaluation shows model size reduction without performance loss, so Model Efficiency should be included.

Looking at the techniques used, Frequency Hashing and Double Hashing are specific methods, so those are subcategories under hashing. The application is in product surfaces, which falls under Industry Applications since it&#39;s used in real-world systems.

The problem domain here is Recommender Systems, but also touches on Memory Optimization because of the focus on storage and communication costs. Evaluation metrics like Model Performance and Storage Efficiency are important as well.

I need to assign at least 8-12 categories. Let me list them out:

1. Model Size Reduction: Directly related to the main goal.
2. Recommender Systems: The application area.
3. Deep Learning: As it deals with DNNs.
4. Hashing Techniques: The method used.
5. Frequency Hashing: Specific hashing method.
6. Double Hashing: Another specific technique.
7. Model Optimization: Overarching category.
8. Sparse Features: Part of the input data in models.
9. Industry Applications: Since it&#39;s applied in industry settings.
10. Memory Efficiency: Focus on reducing storage needs.
11. Model Compression: Reducing model size without losing performance.
12. Evaluation Metrics: As they discuss how effective their method is.

I think this covers all aspects of the article, from the specific techniques used to broader applications and evaluation. This should help users find the article when searching under any of these categories.
&lt;/think&gt;
