Title: Getting Deep Recommenders Fit: Bloom Embeddings for Sparse Binary Input/Output Networks
Abstract:
Recommendation algorithms that incorporate techniques from deep learning are becoming increasingly popular. Due to the structure of the data coming from recommendation domains (i.e., one-hot-encoded vectors of item preferences), these algorithms tend to have large input and output dimensionalities that dominate their overall size. This makes them difficult to train, due to the limited memory of graphical processing units, and difficult to deploy on mobile devices with limited hardware. To address these difficulties, we propose Bloom embeddings, a compression technique that can be applied to the input and output of neural network models dealing with sparse high-dimensional binary-coded instances. Bloom embeddings are computationally efficient, and do not seriously compromise the accuracy of the model up to 1/5 compression ratios. In some cases, they even improve over the original accuracy, with relative increases up to 12%. We evaluate Bloom embeddings on 7 data sets and compare it against 4 alternative methods, obtaining favorable results. We also discuss a number of further advantages of Bloom embeddings, such as ‘on-the-fly’ constant-time operation, zero or marginal space requirements, training time speedups, or the fact that they do not require any change to the core model architecture or training configuration.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article about Bloom embeddings for deep recommenders. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Deep Recommenders&#34; and &#34;Bloom Embeddings,&#34; so I know it&#39;s related to recommendation systems using deep learning techniques. The focus is on handling sparse binary inputs and outputs, which are common in recommendation data where users have many possible items but only a few interactions.

Looking at the abstract, they talk about large dimensionalities due to one-hot encoding of item preferences. This leads to issues with training and deployment because of hardware limitations like GPU memory or mobile devices. The solution proposed is Bloom embeddings, a compression technique that helps reduce model size without sacrificing much accuracy.

They evaluated this method on seven datasets and compared it against four other methods. So, evaluation is an important aspect here, especially in terms of how well the recommendations perform under different metrics beyond just accuracy.

The article also mentions benefits like computational efficiency, space requirements, training time improvements, and compatibility with existing models without needing major architectural changes. These points suggest that practical applications and real-world deployment are significant considerations.

Now, mapping this to categories:

1. **Deep Learning**: The core technique used is deep learning in recommendation systems.
2. **Recommendation Systems**: Obviously, the main focus area.
3. **Bloom Embeddings**: A specific method introduced here.
4. **Sparse Inputs/Outputs**: Dealing with high-dimensional sparse data is a key challenge addressed.
5. **Compression Techniques**: The article&#39;s main contribution is a compression method for neural networks.
6. **Neural Networks**: Since they apply Bloom embeddings to these models.
7. **Memory Efficiency**: Addressing memory issues in training and deployment.
8. **Mobile Deployment**: As it mentions deploying on devices with limited hardware.
9. **Evaluation Metrics**: Beyond just accuracy, considering other aspects of recommendation quality.
10. **Efficiency**: Both computational and resource efficiency are highlighted.

I think these categories cover the main themes of the article, ensuring that users can find this research through various relevant tags without overcrowding any single category.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. The title is &#34;Getting Deep Recommenders Fit: Bloom Embeddings for Sparse Binary Input/Output Networks.&#34; Hmm, from the title, it seems like it&#39;s about recommendation systems using deep learning techniques, specifically dealing with sparse binary inputs.

Looking at the abstract, the authors are talking about how recommendation algorithms, especially those using deep learning, face issues because they deal with high-dimensional data. This makes them hard to train and deploy on mobile devices due to memory constraints. They propose something called Bloom embeddings as a compression technique for these input and output layers.

The abstract mentions that Bloom embeddings are computationally efficient and don&#39;t significantly reduce accuracy even when compressed by up to 1/5, sometimes even improving it. They tested this method on seven datasets and compared it with four alternatives, getting good results. Other benefits include constant-time operations, minimal space requirements, faster training times, and no need to change the model architecture.

So, breaking this down into categories:

1. **Deep Learning**: The article clearly involves deep learning techniques in recommendation systems.
2. **Recommendation Systems**: It&#39;s directly about improving recommendation algorithms.
3. **Compression Techniques**: Bloom embeddings are a form of data compression for neural networks.
4. **Efficiency**: They discuss computational efficiency and training time speedups, which relates to efficiency.
5. **Scalability**: Addressing high-dimensional data and deployment issues ties into scalability.
6. **Neural Networks**: The focus is on neural network models, particularly their input/output layers.
7. **Sparse Data Handling**: The problem deals with sparse binary inputs, so this category fits.
8. **Model Optimization**: Bloom embeddings optimize the model by reducing its size without significant loss in accuracy.
9. **Mobile Computing**: The deployment part mentions mobile devices, which is about optimizing for mobile hardware.
10. **Evaluation Methods**: They evaluate across multiple datasets and compare with other methods, so evaluation is a key aspect.

I should make sure each category is relevant and that I&#39;m covering all the main points without overcomplicating it. Also, checking if any categories are too specific or too broad. Maybe &#34;Efficiency&#34; could be more specific, but given the context, it&#39;s appropriate.
&lt;/think&gt;
