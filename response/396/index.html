Title: Query-Based Simple and Scalable Recommender Systems with Apache Hivemall
Abstract:
This study demonstrates a way to build large-scale recommender systems by just writing a series of SQL-like queries. In order to efficiently run recommendation logics on a cluster of computers, we implemented a variety of recommendation algorithms and common recommendation functions (e.g., efficient similarity computation, top-k retrieval, and evaluation measures) asHive user-defined functions (UDFs) in Apache Hivemall. We demonstrate that how Apache Hivemall can easily be used for building a scalable recommendation system with satisfying business requirements such as scalability, latency, and stability.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on the given guidelines. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Query-Based Simple and Scalable Recommender Systems with Apache Hivemall.&#34; The abstract mentions building large-scale recommender systems using SQL-like queries, implementing recommendation algorithms as Hive UDFs in Apache Hivemall, and highlights aspects like scalability, latency, stability. It also talks about common recommendation functions such as similarity computation, top-k retrieval, and evaluation measures.

First, I should identify the main themes. The article focuses on recommender systems, so that&#39;s a primary category. Since it uses Apache Hivemall, which is related to big data processing, Big Data Processing makes sense. SQL-based approaches are used here, so SQL-Based Recommendation is another good fit.

The algorithms mentioned include similarity computation and top-k retrieval, which fall under recommendation algorithms, so I&#39;ll add Recommendation Algorithms. The system&#39;s scalability is emphasized, so Scalability is a key point. It’s specifically about building scalable systems, so Large-Scale Recommender Systems is appropriate.

They implemented these as Hive UDFs, indicating they used specific tools and techniques for this purpose, hence Hive UDFs. The evaluation measures suggest they focused on system performance, so System Performance Evaluation.

The demonstration includes aspects like business requirements such as scalability and latency, so Business Requirements are another category. Apache Hivemall is the tool used, so that&#39;s a direct category. The implementation was done in SQL-like queries, which ties into Query-Based Implementation.

Putting it all together, I need to make sure each category captures an important aspect of the article without overlapping too much. Each should be clear and user-friendly as per the guidelines.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I need to categorize this research article based on the given guidelines. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Query-Based Simple and Scalable Recommender Systems with Apache Hivemall.&#34; From the title, I can tell it&#39;s about recommender systems, scalability, and uses a specific tool called Apache Hivemall. 

Looking at the abstract: The study talks about building large-scale recommendation systems using SQL-like queries. They implemented various recommendation algorithms as Hive UDFs in Apache Hivemall. It emphasizes scalability, latency, and stability.

Now, I need to map this to relevant categories. Let&#39;s go through each category one by one.

1. **Family of Algorithm**: The article mentions implementing recommendation algorithms, so it&#39;s about Recommender Systems in general. Maybe &#34;Recommender Systems&#34; is a broad category here, but looking at the examples given (like Matrix Factorization, Encoder), perhaps they expect specific types. However, since it&#39;s more about the system and scalability rather than a specific algorithm family, maybe this isn&#39;t the best fit. Alternatively, perhaps &#34;Algorithm Implementation&#34; could be considered, but not sure.

2. **Domain of the Problem**: The domain here is recommendation systems, specifically in large-scale environments, so &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; would fit as a category.

3. **Specific Aspect in Recommendation Space**: The study talks about aspects like scalability, latency, and stability—these are system-related aspects. Also, they mention using SQL-like queries which is an implementation aspect, but perhaps there&#39;s a more specific term. Maybe &#34;Scalability&#34; since the title mentions it and the abstract emphasizes scalable systems.

4. **Aspects of Evaluation**: The abstract doesn&#39;t explicitly talk about evaluation metrics beyond mentioning functions like top-k retrieval and evaluation measures. So maybe not directly applicable here, unless we consider the mention of evaluation as a category, but perhaps better to focus on scalability since it&#39;s more prominent.

5. **Real-World Applications**: They do mention business requirements such as scalability, latency, and stability, which suggests real-world applications. Also, Apache Hivemall is likely used in production environments, so &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; would be a good category.

6. **Other Relevant Categorizations**: The tool used is Apache Hivemall, which is specific to Hive/Hadoop for recommendations, so that&#39;s another category. Additionally, the approach uses SQL-like queries, which ties into Query-Based Recommendations.

Let me list out potential categories:

- Scalability (explicitly mentioned)
-Recommendation Systems (as it&#39;s about building recommenders)
-Real-World Applications (business requirements and tools used)
-Apache Hivemall (specific tool implementation)
-Query-Based Recommendations (SQL-like queries approach)
-Large-Scale Systems (since it&#39;s about scalability in clusters)

Wait, the guidelines mention to aim for 8-12 categories. Let me see if I can find more.

Looking again:

The article uses Hive UDFs and Apache Hivemall, which is part of the broader category of distributed systems or big data tools. So maybe &#34;Distributed Systems&#34; is another category.

Also, the study focuses on efficiency in running recommendation logics on clusters, so perhaps &#34;Efficiency&#34; as a category.

Additionally, since they mention functions like similarity computation and top-k retrieval, these are specific functionalities within recommendation systems, but maybe more specific than needed. Alternatively, the fact that it&#39;s built using Hive could tie into Data Warehousing or SQL-based approaches.

But let me see what categories were suggested in the example: &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback.&#34; So they included scalability, which fits here, and something about systems (Web Systems), but in our case, it&#39;s more distributed systems. Also, no mention of implicit feedback in this article, so that wouldn&#39;t apply.

So compiling all possible categories:

1. Scalability
2. Recommendation Systems
3. Real-World Applications
4. Apache Hivemall
5. Query-Based Recommendations
6. Distributed Systems
7. Large-Scale Systems
8. Efficiency

Wait, but the example included 3 categories. The user is asking for a list of keywords separated by commas, so maybe more than that? Let me check the guidelines: assign each article to at least 8-12 categories. So I need at least 8.

I have:

Scalability, Recommendation Systems, Real-World Applications, Apache Hivemall, Query-Based Recommendations, Distributed Systems, Large-Scale Systems, Efficiency.

That&#39;s 8. Are there more?

The abstract mentions Hive UDFs and building recommendation functions—maybe &#34;UDFs&#34; as a category? Not sure if that&#39;s necessary. Alternatively, since it&#39;s about implementation with SQL-like queries in Hive, maybe &#34;SQL-Based Recommendations.&#34;

Alternatively, the approach is query-based, so perhaps &#34;Query-Based Approach.&#34; Also, the use of clusters for scalability suggests &#34;Cluster Computing.&#34;

Let me check:

Adding &#34;Cluster Computing&#34; and &#34;Query-Based Approach&#34; would bring us to 10.

So categories: Scalability, Recommendation Systems, Real-World Applications, Apache Hivemall, Query-Based Recommendations, Distributed Systems, Large-Scale Systems, Efficiency, Cluster Computing, Query-Based Approach.

That&#39;s 10. Maybe more? The study is about system implementation, so perhaps &#34;System Implementation&#34; as another category.

Alternatively, the article could also touch on performance aspects beyond scalability, but I think we&#39;ve covered most relevant categories.

I should ensure each category is clear and useful. Let me review:

Scalability - directly mentioned.
Recommendation Systems - core topic.
Real-World Applications - business focus.
Apache Hivemall - specific tool used.
Query-Based Recommendations - method described.
Distributed Systems - relates to cluster computing.
Large-Scale Systems - scalability in systems.
Efficiency - implied by scalable and efficient functions.
Cluster Computing - part of distributed systems but specific to clusters.
Query-Based Approach - the method.

I think these are all relevant. Perhaps adding &#34;Implementation&#34; as a broader category, but I don&#39;t see it explicitly mentioned beyond the tool. Alternatively, maybe &#34;Hadoop ecosystem&#34; since Apache Hivemall is built on Hive which is part of Hadoop. But perhaps that&#39;s too specific.

Alternatively, considering that the system uses SQL queries for recommendations, &#34;SQL-Based Recommendations&#34; could be another category, but I&#39;ve already included Query-Based Recommendations.

I think 10 categories are sufficient, and each is clear and relevant.
&lt;/think&gt;

Scalability, Recommendation Systems, Real-World Applications, Apache Hivemall, Query-Based Recommendations, Distributed Systems, Large-Scale Systems, Efficiency, Cluster Computing, Query-Based Approach</code></pre>
