        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Data Augmentation using Reverse Prompt for Cost-Efficient Cold-Start Recommendation
Abstract:
Recommendation systems that use auxiliary information such as product names and categories have been proposed to address the cold-start problem. However, these methods do not perform well when we only have insufficient warm-start training data. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can perform as effective cold-start recommendation systems even with limited warm-start data. However, they require numerous API calls for inferences, which leads to high operational costs in terms of time and money. This is a significant concern in industrial applications. In this paper, we introduce a new method, RevAug, which leverages LLMs as a data augmentation to enhance cost-efficient cold-start recommendation systems. To generate pseudo-samples, we have reversed the commonly used prompt for an LLM from “Would this user like this item?” to “What kind of items would this user like?”. Generated outputs by this reverse prompt are pseudo-auxiliary information utilized to enhance recommendation systems in the training phase. In numerical experiments with four real-world datasets, RevAug demonstrated superior performance in cold-start settings with limited warm-start data compared to existing methods. Moreover, RevAug significantly reduced API fees and processing time compared to an LLM-based recommendation method.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories. Let&#39;s start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Data Augmentation using Reverse Prompt for Cost-Efficient Cold-Start Recommendation.&#34; So, key terms here are data augmentation, reverse prompt, cost-efficient, cold-start recommendation. The abstract mentions that it addresses the cold-start problem in recommendation systems, which is when there&#39;s insufficient warm-start training data. They use large language models (LLMs) to generate pseudo-samples with a reversed prompt approach.

So, let me break down the main themes:

1. **Cold Start**: This is central because the article specifically targets the cold-start issue.
2. **Data Augmentation**: The method used involves creating additional training data through reverse prompts.
3. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: These are used as a tool in their approach, so that&#39;s another category.
4. **Recommendation Systems**: Obviously, since it&#39;s about improving recommendation methods.
5. **Cost Efficiency**: They mention reducing API fees and processing time, which is an operational cost concern.
6. **Methodology**: The article introduces a new method called RevAug, focusing on enhancing existing systems.
7. **Evaluation in Cold-Start Settings**: They tested their approach under limited warm-start data conditions.

Now, considering the categories provided as examples, I can map these themes:

- **Cold Start** is directly mentioned, so that&#39;s one.
- The problem domain here relates to recommendation systems, which ties into domains like general recommendations or maybe even more specific areas if applicable.
- Data augmentation techniques are a method they&#39;re using, so that fits under methodology aspects.
- They mention using LLMs as part of their solution, so the family of algorithm category would include LLMs.
- Cost efficiency is about operational costs, which ties into the aspect of evaluation or application in real-world settings.
- The approach uses reverse prompts as a novel method, so that&#39;s another methodology point.

I should also consider any specific terms from the article. RevAug is their method, but it might be too niche for a category unless we have many similar methods. Instead, focusing on broader categories that encapsulate this would be better.

So, compiling these thoughts, the relevant categories should include Cold Start as the primary one. Then, looking at the methodology: Reverse Prompt and Data Augmentation are specific techniques used, so those can be separate categories. The family of algorithm includes LLMs since they&#39;re central to their approach. Evaluation aspects like Performance in Cold-Start Settings and Cost Efficiency show how effective the method is both in performance and financially.

Additionally, considering it&#39;s a recommendation system improvement, I should categorize it under Recommendation Systems. Since they mention using real-world datasets and applications, Real-World Applications would be appropriate too.

Putting it all together, the categories cover the main aspects of the article, ensuring that users can find it through multiple entry points relevant to their interests.
&lt;/think&gt;
