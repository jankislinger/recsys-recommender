Title: The Effect of Feedback Granularity on Recommender Systems Performance
Abstract:
The main source of knowledge utilized in recommender systems (RS) is users’ feedback. While the usage of implicit feedback (i.e. user’s behavior statistics) is gaining in prominence, the explicit feedback (i.e. user’s ratings) remain an important data source. This is true especially for domains, where evaluation of an object does not require an extensive usage and users are well motivated to do so (e.g., video-on-demand services or library archives).
So far, numerous rating schemes for explicit feedback have been proposed, ranging both in granularity and presentation style. There are several works studying the effect of rating’s scale and presentation on user’s rating behavior, e.g. willingness to provide feedback or various biases in rating behavior. Nonetheless, the effect of ratings granularity on RS performance remain largely under-researched.
In this paper, we studied the combined effect of ratings granularity and supposed probability of feedback existence on various performance statistics of recommender systems. Results indicate that decreasing feedback granularity may lead to changes in RS’s performance w.r.t. nDCG for some recommending algorithms. Nonetheless, in most cases the effect of feedback granularity is surpassed by even a small decrease in feedback’s quantity. Therefore, our results corroborate the policy of many major real-world applications, i.e. preference of simpler rating schemes with the higher chance of feedback reception instead of finer-grained rating scenarios.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about feedback granularity in recommender systems. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;The Effect of Feedback Granularity on Recommender Systems Performance.&#34; The abstract discusses how recommender systems use user feedback, both implicit (like behavior stats) and explicit (ratings). It mentions that while explicit feedback is still important in certain domains like video services or libraries, there&#39;s not much research on how the granularity of these ratings affects system performance.

The study looks at how different rating granularities combined with the probability of feedback existing impact RS performance. They found that lower granularity can change performance metrics like nDCG for some algorithms, but even a small decrease in feedback quantity has a bigger effect. This supports real-world applications preferring simpler rating schemes to get more feedback.

Now, I need to assign categories based on guidelines provided. The article talks about explicit and implicit feedback, so those should be included. It&#39;s about recommendation systems, so &#34;Recommender Systems&#34; is key. They discuss evaluation metrics like nDCG, so aspects of evaluation fit here. 

The study compares different rating schemes&#39; granularities, so &#34;Rating Granularity&#34; makes sense. The findings support real-world applications using simpler systems to encourage more feedback, which ties into real-world applications or user behavior.

They mention domains where explicit feedback is effective like video services and libraries, so those are relevant. The evaluation aspect also includes looking at recommendation performance metrics beyond just accuracy, so &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; fits as well.

I should make sure each category aligns with the guidelines: using clear names, multiple categories (8-12), balancing distribution, consistency, etc. I need to cover the core themes without overcrowding any category. 

So compiling these thoughts, the categories would include explicit and implicit feedback types, recommendation systems themselves, evaluation aspects like nDCG and beyond accuracy metrics, user behavior related to feedback willingness, real-world applications, domains where explicit feedback is key, and rating schemes specifically regarding their granularity.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task step by step. The user provided a research article about the effect of feedback granularity on recommender systems performance and wants it categorized into relevant keywords. My goal is to assign 8-12 categories that accurately represent the content while ensuring they&#39;re useful for users.

First, I&#39;ll read through the title and abstract carefully. The main focus seems to be on how the granularity of user ratings affects recommendation system performance. They mention both implicit and explicit feedback but delve deeper into explicit ratings.

So, starting with &#34;Explicit Feedback&#34; makes sense since that&#39;s a core theme. Next, &#34;Feedback Granularity&#34; is another key term as the study specifically examines this aspect.

The article discusses recommender systems in general, so adding &#34;Recommender Systems&#34; is essential. It also looks at performance metrics like nDCG, which ties into evaluation methods, hence &#34;Evaluation Metrics.&#34;

They compare different rating scales and presentation styles, so &#34;Rating Scale&#34; and &#34;Presentation Style&#34; are relevant categories. The study suggests that simpler rating schemes might be better because they encourage more feedback, pointing to the importance of user engagement. Therefore, &#34;User Engagement&#34; should be included.

The practical applications mentioned in the abstract relate to real-world scenarios, like video-on-demand services. This leads me to add &#34;Real-World Applications.&#34; Additionally, the paper touches on biases in rating behavior, so &#34;Bias (Recommender Systems)&#34; is a fitting category.

Lastly, considering the technical aspects of recommendation algorithms, terms like &#34;Algorithm Performance&#34; and &#34;Rating Granularity&#34; seem appropriate to capture the nuances discussed in the study.

I&#39;ll make sure each category is distinct yet relevant and that together they provide a comprehensive view of the article&#39;s content. This should help users navigate and discover related research more effectively.
&lt;/think&gt;

Explicit Feedback, Feedback Granularity, Recommender Systems, Evaluation Metrics, Rating Scale, Presentation Style, User Engagement, Real-World Applications, Bias (Recommender Systems), Algorithm Performance, nDCG, Rating Behavior</code></pre>
