        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: RADio – Rank-Aware Divergence Metrics to Measure Normative Diversity in News Recommendations
Abstract:
In traditional recommender system literature, diversity is often seen as the opposite of similarity, and typically defined as the distance between identified topics, categories or word models. However, this is not expressive of the social science’s interpretation of diversity, which accounts for a news organization’s norms and values and which we here refer to as normative diversity. We introduce RADio, a versatile metrics framework to evaluate recommendations according to these normative goals. RADio introduces a rank-aware Jensen Shannon (JS) divergence. This combination accounts for (i) a user’s decreasing propensity to observe items further down a list and (ii) full distributional shifts as opposed to point estimates. We evaluate RADio’s ability to reflect five normative concepts in news recommendations on the Microsoft News Dataset and six (neural) recommendation algorithms, with the help of our metadata enrichment pipeline. We find that RADio provides insightful estimates that can potentially be used to inform news recommender system design.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let&#39;s break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: &#34;RADio – Rank-Aware Divergence Metrics to Measure Normative Diversity in News Recommendations.&#34; The key terms here are RADio (a metric framework), rank-aware divergence, normative diversity, and news recommendations.

The abstract elaborates that traditional recommender systems view diversity as the opposite of similarity, often using distance measures between topics or models. However, this article introduces a new approach called RADio, which focuses on normative diversity. This concept ties into a news organization&#39;s norms and values, moving beyond just computational metrics.

So, starting with the core themes:

1. **Normative Diversity**: The main focus is on measuring diversity in a way that considers social science interpretations, not just computational ones.
2. **Diversity Metrics**: It introduces a new method for evaluating recommendation systems&#39; diversity.
3. **News Recommendations**: The application area is specifically news, which has unique considerations compared to other domains like movies or books.

Next, the abstract mentions the use of Jensen-Shannon divergence in a rank-aware manner. This suggests categories related to specific algorithms or techniques:

4. **Divergence Metrics**: As RADio uses JS divergence.
5. **Rank-Aware Methods**: Because it considers the user&#39;s propensity to observe items further down the list.

The article evaluates this framework on the Microsoft News Dataset and six neural recommendation algorithms, indicating that real-world applications are part of their methodology:

6. **Real-World Applications**: They applied their metrics in a practical setting.
7. **Neural Recommendation Algorithms**: The specific algorithms used were neural-based.

They also mention metadata enrichment pipeline, which ties into how they processed data for evaluation:

8. **Metadata Enrichment**: This suggests techniques used to enhance or process the data beyond raw information.

Considering the broader aspects of recommendation systems:

9. **Recommender Systems Evaluation**: Evaluating recommendation systems is a core aspect here.
10. **Algorithm Design**: The framework could inform how recommendation algorithms are designed, especially in news contexts.

Looking at evaluation aspects:

11. **Evaluation Frameworks**: They developed RADio as an evaluation tool.
12. **Social Science Aspects**: Since normative diversity relates to social science interpretations.

Putting it all together, the categories should cover both specific technical aspects and broader themes relevant to users interested in recommendation systems, especially in news, diversity metrics, and algorithm design. The names need to be clear and user-friendly, aligning with how someone might search for this information.
&lt;/think&gt;
