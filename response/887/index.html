Title: Task Aware Feature Extraction Framework for Sequential Dependence Multi-Task Learning
Abstract:
In online recommendation, financial service, etc., the most common application of multi-task learning (MTL) is the multi-step conversion estimations. A core property of the multi-step conversion is the sequential dependence among tasks. Most existing works focus far more on the specific post-view click-through rate (CTR) and post-click conversion rate (CVR) estimations, which neglect the generalization of sequential dependence multi-task learning (SDMTL). Besides, the performance of the SDMTL framework is also deteriorated by the interference derived from implicitly conflict information passing between adjacent tasks. In this paper, a systematic learning paradigm of the SDMTL problem is established for the first time, which can transform the SDMTL problem into a general MTL problem and be applicable to more general multi-step conversion scenarios with longer conversion path or stronger task dependence. Also, the distribution dependence between adjacent task spaces is illustrated from a theoretical point of view. On the other hand, an SDMTL architecture, named Task Aware Feature Extraction (TAFE), is developed to enable dynamic task representation learning from a sample-wise view. TAFE selectively reconstructs the implicit shared information corresponding to each sample case and performs explicit task-specific extraction under dependence constraints. Extensive experiments on offline public and real-world industrial datasets, and online A/B implementations demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of proposed theoretical and implementation frameworks.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through both carefully.

The title is &#34;Task Aware Feature Extraction Framework for Sequential Dependence Multi-Task Learning.&#34; From the title alone, it mentions multi-task learning (MTL), which suggests that the article deals with machine learning techniques where multiple tasks are learned simultaneously. It also talks about sequential dependence, implying there&#39;s a focus on how different tasks in a sequence influence each other.

Looking at the abstract, the article discusses applications in online recommendation and financial services. So right away, I can think of categories related to these domains: Online Recommendation and Financial Services. 

The abstract mentions multi-step conversion estimations, which involves predicting multiple steps in a user&#39;s journey, like from viewing an item to clicking through to purchasing. This indicates that the article is dealing with sequential tasks, so Sequential Dependence should be a category.

It talks about CTR (click-through rate) and CVR (conversion rate) estimations, which are key metrics in recommendation systems. These could fall under Click-Through Rate Prediction and Conversion Rate Estimation.

The paper addresses the problem of interference from conflicting information passing between tasks in multi-task learning. This suggests that one of the categories should be Multi-Task Learning.

They propose a framework called TAFE (Task Aware Feature Extraction), which is designed to handle these sequential dependencies more effectively. So, Frameworks and Architectures would be an appropriate category here.

The research also includes experiments on both offline datasets and real-world applications with A/B testing. That means Real-World Applications and A/B Testing should be included as categories.

The abstract highlights the importance of dynamic task representation learning from a sample-wise view, which ties into Dynamic Task Representation. Additionally, since they&#39;re looking at how tasks depend on each other theoretically, Theoretical Analysis is another relevant category.

Given that the framework is designed for more general multi-step conversion scenarios with longer paths or stronger dependencies, Generalization in Multi-Task Learning would be a suitable category as well.

Putting it all together, I think these categories cover the main aspects of the article without being too niche or overlapping excessively. They should help users find related content easily and ensure the interface is user-friendly.
&lt;/think&gt;

Multi-Task Learning, Sequential Dependence, Click-Through Rate Prediction, Conversion Rate Estimation, Online Recommendation, Financial Services, Feature Extraction, Multi-Step Conversion, Task Representation, A/B Testing, Real-World Applications, Theoretical Analysis, Generalization, Dynamic Task Representation, Frameworks and Architectures.</code></pre>

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task step by step. The user has provided an article with a specific title and abstract, and they want it categorized into relevant keywords based on given guidelines. 

First, I&#39;ll read through the title: &#34;Task Aware Feature Extraction Framework for Sequential Dependence Multi-Task Learning.&#34; It mentions multi-task learning (MTL), sequential dependence, and feature extraction. So, MTL is definitely a key area here.

Next, looking at the abstract, it discusses applications in online recommendation and financial services. These are specific domains where MTL is applied, so I should include those as categories: Online Recommendations and Financial Services.

The paper addresses multi-step conversion estimations, which refers to predicting multiple steps in a user&#39;s journey, like clicks followed by conversions. This falls under Conversion Rate Estimation and Multi-Step Conversions, both of which are important for understanding user behavior across different stages.

Sequential Dependence is explicitly mentioned as a core property, so that should be another category. It deals with the order and dependencies between tasks in MTL.

The paper also talks about handling interference from conflicting information between tasks. This suggests they&#39;re dealing with Task Interference, which is a specific challenge in multi-task learning scenarios.

Looking deeper into their proposed framework, Task Aware Feature Extraction (TAFE) focuses on dynamic task representation and sample-wise reconstruction. This indicates that the article covers Feature Extraction Techniques tailored for MTL, so Feature Extraction is another category to include.

The paper mentions both offline public datasets and real-world industrial applications with A/B testing. Real-World Applications and A/B Testing are thus relevant categories as they show practical implementations and validations of their framework.

Additionally, the focus on theoretical aspects like distribution dependence between tasks points towards a Theoretical Framework category, highlighting the foundational research in this area.

Putting it all together, I&#39;ll list these categories ensuring each is distinct yet relevant to the article&#39;s content. This should provide a comprehensive and user-friendly categorization.
&lt;/think&gt;
