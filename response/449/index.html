Title: Online Learning to Rank for Sequential Music Recommendation
Abstract:
The prominent success of music streaming services has brought increasingly complex challenges for music recommendation. In particular, in a streaming setting, songs are consumed sequentially within a listening session, which should cater not only for the user’s historical preferences, but also for eventual preference drifts, triggered by a sudden change in the user’s context. In this paper, we propose a novel online learning to rank approach for music recommendation aimed to continuously learn from the user’s listening feedback. In contrast to existing online learning approaches for music recommendation, we leverage implicit feedback as the only signal of the user’s preference. Moreover, to adapt rapidly to preference drifts over millions of songs, we represent each song in a lower dimensional feature space and explore multiple directions in this space as duels of candidate recommendation models. Our thorough evaluation using listening sessions from Last.fm demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach at learning faster and better compared to state-of-the-art online learning approaches.

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about music recommendations. Let&#39;s see... The title is &#34;Online Learning to Rank for Sequential Music Recommendation,&#34; which already gives me some clues.

First, the main topic seems to be recommendation systems, specifically in the domain of music. That&#39;s a clear category right there: Music Recommendations. They mention it&#39;s an online learning approach, so Online Learning should definitely be another category. The paper talks about using implicit feedback as the only signal, which is different from explicit feedback, so I&#39;ll note that down as Implicit Feedback.

The abstract mentions dealing with sequential recommendations in a streaming setting, where songs are played one after another. So, Sequential Recommendations and Streaming Music make sense here. They also address preference drifts, meaning users changing their tastes over time, so Preference Drift is another important category.

They use Last.fm for evaluation, which is a real-world application, so that adds Real-World Applications to the list. The approach involves learning to rank, hence Learning to Rank. The method leverages lower-dimensional feature spaces and duels of candidate models, so Feature Engineering and Model Comparison are relevant categories too.

Looking at the broader areas, this falls under Recommendation Systems overall. Since they&#39;re continuously learning from user feedback, it&#39;s a dynamic system, so Dynamic Recommendations is another category. They mention evaluating beyond just accuracy, looking into how well they adapt to changes, which ties into Evaluation Metrics beyond traditional accuracy measures.

Putting it all together, I think these categories cover the article comprehensively without being too narrow or overlapping excessively.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Online Learning to Rank for Sequential Music Recommendation.&#34; The user has provided guidelines on how to do this, which include assigning each article to 8-12 categories. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I&#39;ll start by reading the title and abstract carefully to understand what the paper is about. The title mentions &#34;Online Learning to Rank&#34; which suggests that it&#39;s about an algorithm that learns in real-time and ranks items (in this case, music). The focus is on sequential recommendations, so the order of songs matters within a listening session.

Looking at the abstract, the main challenge addressed is providing music recommendations in a streaming setting where users have complex behaviors. They mention handling historical preferences and preference drifts, which are sudden changes in user context. The paper proposes a novel online learning to rank approach that uses only implicit feedback (like play history) to learn from the user&#39;s behavior continuously.

Some key points from the abstract:
1. **Online Learning**: This is a family of algorithms where models update incrementally as data arrives.
2. **Music Recommendation**: Clearly falls under this domain, specifically sequential recommendations since it&#39;s about listening sessions.
3. **Implicit Feedback**: They use only play history or similar indirect signals, which is different from explicit ratings.
4. **Preference Drifts**: This refers to changes in user preferences over time, which the system needs to adapt to quickly.
5. **Efficient Learning with Lower-Dimensional Features**: They reduce the dimensionality of song features to make learning faster and more efficient, especially important for handling millions of songs.

Now, I&#39;ll map these points to potential categories based on the guidelines provided:

- **Family of Algorithm (Online Learning)**: The paper uses online learning, so this is a primary category.
- **Domain**: It&#39;s about music recommendation, so &#34;Music&#34; and &#34;Streaming Services&#34; might be relevant. However, since streaming services are more about delivery, maybe just &#34;Music&#34; as the domain?
Wait, looking back at the examples given, domains include things like Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education. So perhaps &#34;Music&#34; is appropriate here.

- **Recommendation Space**: The paper deals with sequential recommendations, so that&#39;s a specific aspect within recommendation systems.
- **Evaluation Aspects**: They mention learning faster and better, which relates to aspects like adaptability or efficiency in evaluation but not sure if it&#39;s an evaluation metric. Maybe &#34;Adaptability&#34; is more relevant.
Wait, the example categories include things like Diversity of Recommendations or Beyond Accuracy. Since they focus on adapting quickly, perhaps that&#39;s a specific aspect.

- **Real-World Applications**: They mention using Last.fm data, which is a real-world application. So maybe &#34;A/B Test&#34; or something similar? Wait, no, it&#39;s just evaluation using listening sessions, not necessarily A/B testing. Maybe &#34;Evaluation Methods&#34; but that&#39;s too broad.

Wait, the guidelines say to categorize based on aspects like whether they use real-world applications such as A/B tests or user surveys. The paper uses Last.fm data, which is a dataset from a real service, so maybe &#34;Real World Applications.&#34;

- **Implicit Feedback**: They only use implicit feedback (like play history), so that&#39;s another category.

- **Scalability**: Handling millions of songs implies scalability is addressed.

- **Efficiency**: Lower-dimensional features for efficient learning. So efficiency and scalability are related but perhaps separate categories.

- **Learning to Rank**: The paper specifically uses a learning to rank approach, which is a family within recommendation systems.

So compiling all these thoughts:

1. Online Learning
2. Music
3. Sequential Recommendations
4. Implicit Feedback
5. Real World Applications (using Last.fm)
6. Learning to Rank
7. Scalability
8. Efficiency
9. Preference Drifts

Wait, that&#39;s nine categories. I can think of a few more:

- **Algorithm Family**: Online Learning
- **Recommendation Type**: Sequential Recommendations
- **Feedback Type**: Implicit Feedback
- **Domain Application**: Music Streaming (since it&#39;s about streaming services)
- **Evaluation Methodology**: Evaluation with Real Data (Last.fm)
- **Learning Technique**: Learning to Rank
- **Efficiency Aspect**: Dimensionality Reduction (lower-dimensional features)
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Handling Preference Drifts

Hmm, maybe some of these can be combined or adjusted. For example, &#34;Music Streaming&#34; is a domain, and &#34;Real World Applications&#34; might cover the use of Last.fm data.

So now, selecting from the options:

- Online Learning
- Music (domain)
- Sequential Recommendations (specific aspect)
- Implicit Feedback
- Real World Applications (since they used Last.fm dataset)
- Learning to Rank (algorithm family)
- Scalability (as it&#39;s about millions of songs)
- Efficiency (lower-dimensional features)
- Preference Drifts (this is a specific problem they address)

Wait, that&#39;s nine. Maybe add &#34;Efficient Learning&#34; as another category? Or perhaps &#34;Scalability&#34; covers both handling large datasets and efficient learning.

Alternatively, think of the example categories given: Family of algorithm, domain, specific in recommendation space, aspects of evaluation, real-world applications. So aligning:

- Algorithm family: Online Learning
- Domain: Music
- Specific in recommendation space: Sequential Recommendations
- Aspects of evaluation: They evaluate using Last.fm, so maybe &#34;Evaluation on Real Data&#34;
But the example categories didn&#39;t have that exact category; instead, they had things like Diversity or Beyond Accuracy. Alternatively, perhaps &#34;Real World Applications&#34; is better.

- Real-world applications: A/B Test/User Survey – in this case, it&#39;s not exactly an application but evaluation using real data. Maybe we can still categorize under &#34;Evaluation on Real Data.&#34;

But the user&#39;s example includes categories like &#34;A/B Test,&#34; so maybe that&#39;s more about deployment rather than evaluation data. So perhaps better to stick with &#34;Real World Applications&#34; because they used a real dataset.

Also, since it&#39;s about handling preference drifts, which is a specific problem in recommendation systems, I can include that as another category.

So compiling:

1. Online Learning (family)
2. Music
3. Sequential Recommendations
4. Implicit Feedback
5. Real World Applications
6. Learning to Rank
7. Scalability
8. Efficiency
9. Preference Drifts

That&#39;s nine categories. To reach 10-12, maybe add:

10. Evaluation Methods (they performed thorough evaluation)
11. Dimensionality Reduction (since they used lower-dimensional features)
12. Dynamic Adaptation (handling preference drifts)

But maybe some of these are redundant or can be merged.

Alternatively, perhaps &#34;Real World Applications&#34; is already covering the dataset part. Also, since they focused on scalability and efficiency in handling large datasets, those could stand as separate categories.

Wait, perhaps &#34;Scalability&#34; and &#34;Efficiency&#34; are both necessary.

So final list:

1. Online Learning
2. Music
3. Sequential Recommendations
4. Implicit Feedback
5. Real World Applications (using Last.fm)
6. Learning to Rank
7. Scalability
8. Efficiency
9. Preference Drifts

That&#39;s nine, which is acceptable as the user mentioned &#34;You&#39;re aiming for around 10–12 categories.&#34; Maybe I can add two more:

10. Evaluation Methods
11. Adaptation (as they adapt to preference drift)

Alternatively, since it&#39;s about handling millions of songs, perhaps &#34;Big Data&#34; but that might be too broad.

So maybe stick with nine and see if I missed any.

Wait, the paper is within recommendation systems, so perhaps also include &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; as a broader category. But in the guidelines, it says domain includes things like Movies or Music, which are specific. So &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; might be too broad unless it&#39;s already covered by another category. Alternatively, maybe not necessary.

Alternatively, think about whether to include &#34;Algorithm&#34; as a family. Since they used online learning, perhaps that&#39;s the family.

Wait, in the examples given, the categories were:

- Family of algorithm (e.g., Collaborative Filtering)
- Domain (e.g., Books)
- Specific in recommendation space (e.g., Sequential Recommendations)
- Aspects of evaluation (e.g., Diversity)

So aligning with that, perhaps &#34;Algorithm&#34; is more specific than family. Wait, no—family is the higher category.

Wait, I think it&#39;s better to just list them as per the initial thought process.
&lt;/think&gt;

The categories for the given research paper are:

1. **Online Learning** (Family of Algorithm)
2. **Music** (Domain)
3. **Sequential Recommendations** (Specific in Recommendation Space)
4. **Implicit Feedback** (Feedback Type)
5. **Real World Applications** (using Last.fm dataset)
6. **Learning to Rank** (Algorithm Family)
7. **Scalability** (Handling millions of songs)
8. **Efficiency** (Lower-dimensional features)
9. **Preference Drifts** (Specific Problem Addressed)

These categories encapsulate the key aspects of the paper, including its methodology, application domain, and specific contributions to recommendation systems.</code></pre>
