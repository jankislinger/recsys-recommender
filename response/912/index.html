Title: Towards Sustainability-aware Recommender Systems: Analyzing the Trade-off Between Algorithms Performance and Carbon Footprint
Abstract:
In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of the trade-off between the performance of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and their sustainability. In particular, we compared 18 popular recommendation algorithms in terms of both standard metrics (i.e., accuracy and diversity of the recommendations) as well as in terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint on three different datasets. In order to obtain a fair comparison, all the algorithms were run based on the implementations available in a popular recommendation library, i.e., RecBole, and used the same experimental settings. The outcomes of the experiments clearly showed that the choice of the optimal recommendation algorithm requires a thorough analysis, since more sophisticated algorithms often led to tiny improvements at the cost of an exponential increase of carbon emissions. Through this paper, we aim to shed light on the problem of carbon footprint and energy consumption of recommender systems, and we make the first step towards the development of sustainability-aware recommendation algorithms.

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task. The user provided a research article about sustainability in Recommender Systems, specifically looking at how different recommendation algorithms trade off performance with their carbon footprint. 

First, I need to understand the core themes of the article. It mentions analyzing 18 recommendation algorithms across metrics like accuracy and diversity, as well as energy consumption and carbon emissions. The experiments were conducted using RecBole, a popular recommendation library, ensuring fair comparisons.

So, starting with the family of algorithms, the paper covers multiple recommendation methods, so &#34;Recommendation Algorithms&#34; is a good fit. Since it&#39;s comparing various approaches, &#34;Algorithm Comparison&#34; makes sense too.

Looking at sustainability aspects, terms like &#34;Sustainability,&#34; &#34;Carbon Footprint,&#34; and &#34;Energy Consumption&#34; are central to the study. These categories help users interested in green computing or environmental impacts find relevant articles.

The evaluation criteria mentioned include accuracy and diversity of recommendations, so those should be included as separate categories. The paper also touches on real-world applications by discussing how algorithm choices affect energy use, which ties into &#34;Real World Applications.&#34;

Another key point is the trade-off between performance metrics and environmental impact, so a category like &#34;Performance Metrics&#34; would cover that aspect.

Considering the domain, since this applies to recommendation systems in general without specifying a particular field like movies or books, categories like &#34;Recommendation Systems,&#34; &#34;Recommender Systems,&#34; and &#34;Sustainability-aware RS&#34; are appropriate. These ensure the article is found within the broader context of recommendations while highlighting its unique focus on sustainability.

Lastly, terms like &#34;Green Computing&#34; and &#34;Energy-efficient Algorithms&#34; encapsulate the paper&#39;s contribution to environmentally conscious technology, which is a growing interest area for many users.

I need to make sure each category is clear and user-friendly. They should cover both specific details from the article and broader themes that align with user search behaviors. This way, users can easily navigate through these categories to discover this and similar articles.

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task for the given research article. The title is &#34;Towards Sustainability-aware Recommender Systems: Analyzing the Trade-off Between Algorithms Performance and Carbon Footprint,&#34; and the abstract discusses comparing 18 recommendation algorithms based on their performance and carbon footprint.

First, I&#39;ll break down the key elements from the title and abstract. The main focus seems to be on sustainability in recommender systems, specifically looking at how different algorithms perform in terms of both effectiveness (like accuracy and diversity) and environmental impact (energy consumption and carbon emissions). They tested 18 algorithms using RecBole on three datasets.

Now, applying the guidelines provided:

1. **Categorization Accuracy**: I need to identify relevant categories that accurately reflect the article&#39;s content. The paper is about recommenders&#39; sustainability, so &#34;Sustainability&#34; is a must. It&#39;s also looking at carbon footprint, so &#34;Carbon Footprint&#34; and &#34;Energy Consumption&#34; should be included.

2. **Category Utility**: Each category should have enough articles. Since this is one of the first papers on this topic, these categories might not be too crowded yet, but they&#39;re still relevant as sustainability becomes a bigger focus in tech.

3. **User-Centric Design**: Users interested in green technology or efficient systems would look for &#34;Sustainability&#34; and &#34;Energy Efficiency.&#34; Also, since it&#39;s about recommenders, &#34;Recommendation Algorithms&#34; is essential.

4. **Consistency**: The categories should align with existing ones if any, ensuring a cohesive interface.

Looking deeper, the paper compares algorithms&#39; performance metrics (accuracy, diversity) against environmental factors. So &#34;Algorithm Performance,&#34; &#34;Accuracy,&#34; and &#34;Diversity of Recommendations&#34; fit here.

They used RecBole, which is a recommendation library, so maybe &#34;Recommendation Libraries&#34; could be another category, but it&#39;s more about the tool they used rather than the content itself.

Also, the paper discusses trade-offs between performance and environmental impact. This implies &#34;Energy Efficiency,&#34; as they&#39;re optimizing not just for accuracy but also for lower carbon emissions.

Considering all these points, the categories should include both sustainability aspects and recommendation system specifics. So, I&#39;ll list them as Sustainability, Carbon Footprint, Energy Consumption, Recommendation Algorithms, Algorithm Performance, Accuracy, Diversity of Recommendations, Energy Efficiency, and possibly Recommender Systems (though that&#39;s broad). But to keep it concise and relevant, focusing on specific terms like &#34;Recommendation Libraries&#34; might not add much unless there are other articles in that category.

Wait, the guidelines suggest at least 8 categories. Let me count: Sustainability, Carbon Footprint, Energy Consumption, Recommendation Algorithms, Algorithm Performance, Accuracy, Diversity of Recommendations, Energy Efficiency. That&#39;s eight. Maybe I can include &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; as a broader category to cover it, but it might be redundant.

Alternatively, could &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; be relevant? Since they discuss aspects beyond just accuracy, like environmental impact. So adding &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; makes sense.

So the categories would be: Sustainability, Carbon Footprint, Energy Consumption, Recommendation Algorithms, Algorithm Performance, Accuracy, Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy, and Energy Efficiency.

That&#39;s nine categories. Each is specific enough and should cover user interests related to both recommendation systems and sustainability.
&lt;/think&gt;

Sustainability, Carbon Footprint, Energy Consumption, Recommendation Algorithms, Algorithm Performance, Accuracy, Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy, Energy Efficiency</code></pre>
