        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Kibitz: End-to-End Recommendation System Builder
Abstract:
Kibitz (kibitz.csail.mit.edu) is a web application and recommendation system framework that helps inexperienced and novice programmers to build recommenders without the need to program the back end for the system. The author uploads a table of items, and Kibitz produces a collaborative-filtering recommender for the uploaded items. The recommender can be hosted by Kibitz or downloaded and customized as a set of static pages hosted on the author’s personal web domain. Developers who want to avoid the hassle of writing their own recommender back end may choose to link their websites to our service through our easy to use API. A demo of our system can be found at kibitz.csail.mit.edu/video_demo/.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about Kibitz into relevant categories based on the guidelines provided. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Kibitz: End-to-End Recommendation System Builder.&#34; That immediately tells me it&#39;s about a recommendation system tool. The abstract explains that Kibitz is a web application aimed at helping inexperienced programmers build recommendation systems without needing to handle the backend themselves. Users can upload items, and Kibitz generates a collaborative-filtering recommender. It also mentions that the recommender can be hosted on Kibitz or downloaded as static pages, and there&#39;s an API for integration.

Now, looking at the guidelines, I need to assign at least 8-12 categories per article. The example categories include things like family of algorithms, domain of problem, specific recommendation aspects, evaluation aspects, real-world applications, etc.

Let me break down the key elements from the article:

1. It&#39;s a tool for building recommendation systems.
2. Targets novice programmers.
3. Uses collaborative filtering as a method.
4. Provides an end-to-end solution.
5. Offers both hosting and API integration options.
6. Hosted as a web application with a demo available.

So, starting with the family of algorithms: Collaborative Filtering is definitely one since that&#39;s mentioned. End-to-End suggests it covers all aspects from data input to deployment, so maybe &#34;End-to-End&#34; or &#34;Full Stack.&#34;

The domain isn&#39;t specified here; Kibitz seems general-purpose for any items, but perhaps we can consider it as a Web Application since it&#39;s accessible via the web.

Specific recommendation space: Since it&#39;s about building recommenders without backend coding, that relates to Ease of Use. It might also touch on Recommendation Frameworks because it provides a structured approach to building systems.

Real-world applications are mentioned with hosting options and an API, so &#34;Web Systems&#34; makes sense as it&#39;s deployed online. Also, the fact that developers can integrate via API points towards an Application Programming Interface (API) category.

Looking at evaluation aspects: The system helps in developing recommenders but doesn&#39;t mention specific metrics like accuracy or diversity, so maybe not those categories. However, since it&#39;s a tool aimed at ease of use and deployment, perhaps &#34;Ease of Use&#34; is relevant.

Considering the user-friendliness, the fact that it targets novice programmers suggests it&#39;s developer-friendly. So &#34;Developer-Friendly Tools&#34; could be another category.

Since Kibitz allows users to upload their own items and generate recommenders, this might fall under &#34;Content Agnostic&#34; because it doesn&#39;t specify any particular content type—it works for any uploaded data.

Putting it all together, I need to ensure these categories are clear, user-friendly, and cover the key aspects. Let me list them:

- Collaborative Filtering (algorithm)
- End-to-End (process coverage)
- Recommendation Frameworks (type of tool)
- Ease of Use (user-centric design)
- Web Application (platform type)
- Web Systems (deployment context)
- Application Programming Interface (API usage)
- Developer-Friendly Tools (target audience)
- Content Agnostic (flexibility in data handling)

I think that&#39;s 9 categories, which meets the requirement. I should make sure each category is distinct and accurately reflects a different aspect of the article.
&lt;/think&gt;

Collaborative Filtering, End-to-End, Recommendation Frameworks, Ease of Use, Web Application, Web Systems, Application Programming Interface, Developer-Friendly Tools, Content Agnostic</code></pre>
