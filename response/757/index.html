        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Defending Substitution-based Profile Pollution Attacks on Sequential Recommenders
Abstract:
While sequential recommender systems achieve significant improvements on capturing user dynamics, we argue that sequential recommenders are vulnerable against substitution-based profile pollution attacks. To demonstrate our hypothesis, we propose a substitution-based adversarial attack algorithm, which modifies the input sequence by selecting certain vulnerable elements and substituting them with adversarial items. In both untargeted and targeted attack scenarios, we observe significant performance deterioration using the proposed profile pollution algorithm. Motivated by such observations, we design an efficient adversarial defense method called Dirichlet neighborhood sampling. Specifically, we sample item embeddings from a convex hull constructed by multi-hop neighbors to replace the original items in input sequences. During sampling, a Dirichlet distribution is used to approximate the probability distribution in the neighborhood such that the recommender learns to combat local perturbations. Additionally, we design an adversarial training method tailored for sequential recommender systems. In particular, we represent selected items with one-hot encodings and perform gradient ascent on the encodings to search for the worst case linear combination of item embeddings in training. As such, the embedding function learns robust item representations and the trained recommender is resistant to test-time adversarial examples. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of both our attack and defense methods, which consistently outperform baselines by a significant margin across model architectures and datasets.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Alright, I need to categorize this research article about defending against substitution-based profile pollution attacks on sequential recommenders. Let me start by understanding what the article is about.

The title mentions &#34;sequential recommender systems&#34; and &#34;profile pollution attacks.&#34; The abstract talks about an adversarial attack method that modifies user input sequences, leading to performance issues. They also propose a defense mechanism using Dirichlet neighborhood sampling and adversarial training.

So, the core themes are security in recommendation systems, specifically adversarial attacks and defenses. It&#39;s related to sequential recommenders, which deal with user dynamics over time, so that&#39;s another category. The methods involve machine learning techniques like neural networks and embedding functions, so those should be included.

I need to assign this article to multiple categories as per the guidelines. Let me think about the possible categories:

1. **Adversarial Attacks**: Since the paper discusses attacks on recommendation systems.
2. **Security in Recommender Systems**: Directly related to defending against attacks.
3. **Sequential Recommenders**: Focuses on systems that handle user sequences over time.
4. **Machine Learning**: The defense methods use ML techniques.
5. **Neural Networks**: They employ neural models for recommendations.
6. **Embedding Functions**: The paper talks about item embeddings and their manipulation.
7. **Defense Mechanisms**: They propose methods to defend against attacks.
8. **Recommendation Systems**: General category covering all recommendation-related topics.

I should ensure these categories are clear and relevant. Also, they align with user interests in security and ML within recommendations. I think these cover the necessary aspects without being too specific or broad.
&lt;/think&gt;
