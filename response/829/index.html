        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Estimating Long-term Effects from Experimental Data
Abstract:
A/B testing is a powerful tool for a company to make informed decisions about their services and products. A limitation of A/B tests is that they do not easily extend to measure post-experiment (long-term) differences. In this talk, we study a different approach inspired by recent advances in off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning (RL). The basic RL approach assumes customer behavior follows a stationary Markovian process, and estimates the average engagement metric when the process reaches the steady state. However, in realistic scenarios, the stationary assumption is often violated due to weekly variations and seasonality effects. To tackle this challenge, we propose a variation by relaxing the stationary assumption. We empirically tested both stationary and nonstationary approaches in a synthetic dataset and an online store dataset.

Alright, let&#39;s try to figure out how to categorize this research article based on the given guidelines. The title is &#34;Estimating Long-term Effects from Experimental Data,&#34; and the abstract talks about A/B testing limitations, off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning (RL), stationary vs nonstationary assumptions, empirical tests with synthetic and online store datasets.

First, I&#39;ll break down the key elements:

1. **A/B Testing**: This is a common method for comparing different versions of something to see which one performs better. So that&#39;s definitely a category here.

2. **Long-term Effects**: The article focuses on measuring effects beyond just the experiment period. Thatâ€™s important because it addresses future impacts, so &#34;Long-term Effects&#34; should be included.

3. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: They mention off-policy evaluation in RL, which is about evaluating policies without executing them, using historical data. So &#34;Reinforcement Learning&#34; and perhaps a subcategory like &#34;Off-Policy Evaluation.&#34;

4. **Stationary vs Nonstationary Assumptions**: The article relaxes the stationary assumption to account for real-world variations. So categories related to these assumptions are relevant.

5. **Empirical Testing**: They tested their approaches on synthetic and online datasets, so &#34;Empirical Testing&#34; is a good category here.

6. **Synthetic Data and Online Store Dataset**: These specific types of data could be categorized as such or under broader headings like &#34;Experimental Design.&#34;

7. **Evaluation Methods**: Since they&#39;re evaluating methods for long-term effects, this fits into evaluation aspects in recommendation systems or experimental design.

Putting it all together, I need to assign 8-12 categories that cover these aspects without being too specific or too broad. Let me list them:

- A/B Testing
- Long-term Effects
- Reinforcement Learning
- Off-Policy Evaluation
- Stationary Assumption
- Nonstationary Assumption
- Empirical Testing
- Experimental Design
- Real-world Applications (since they tested with an online store dataset)
- Data Analysis

Wait, &#34;Real-world Applications&#34; is good because they applied it in a real setting. I think that&#39;s sufficient. Let me see if any other aspects are missing. They talk about steady-state engagement metrics but maybe &#34;Steady State&#34; isn&#39;t a necessary category on its own. Also, since it&#39;s about evaluation beyond immediate results, perhaps &#34;Evaluation Beyond Accuracy,&#34; as another category.

I should make sure each category is clear and user-friendly. I think that covers all the bases without overcrowding any single category.
&lt;/think&gt;

A/B Testing, Long-term Effects, Reinforcement Learning, Off-Policy Evaluation, Stationary Assumption, Nonstationary Assumption, Empirical Testing, Experimental Design, Real-world Applications, Data Analysis, Evaluation Beyond Accuracy</code></pre>
