        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Personalised Outfit Recommendations: Use Cases, Challenges and Opportunities
Abstract:
Recommender systems for fashion have gained in popularity in recent years. An exciting novel application for recommender systems is outfit personalisation. This work discusses the problem of personalised outfit recommendations and presents use cases, challenges and opportunities. This is still a nascent application area in many ways and there are opportunities for innovation in generating outfits, personalising them and displaying them in a coherent way to the user.
Outfits are different from showing complimentary items (e.g. printer paper when you buy ink, socks when you buy shoes). Complimentary items are mostly about upselling the user to buy further items with their main purchase. Outfits can be that, but they are also about presenting the main item in different contexts. Showing the same dress in a work outfit, an evening outfit and a casual outfit showcases the use and value the user would get out of purchasing the dress (the main item). In retail words, outfits help sell the main item and are not necessarily about upselling the other items in the outfit as well. Outfits are often classified as complimentary item retrieval, however there are some important aspects of outfits that are closer to the concepts of contextual recommendations and full page optimisation (what things do you show next to each other).
This extended abstract talks about the different use cases of outfits, gives an overview of the challenges in this domain, and presents scoped problem definitions that are the building blocks that need to be addressed in order to solve personalised outfits.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article on personalized outfit recommendations into multiple relevant categories. Let&#39;s start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Personalised Outfit Recommendations: Use Cases, Challenges and Opportunities.&#34; The abstract discusses how recommender systems are applied in fashion, specifically focusing on outfit personalization. It mentions that this is a novel application area with opportunities for innovation in generating, personalizing, and displaying outfits. It also differentiates between complimentary items (like upselling) and outfits, which can showcase the main item in various contexts.

Now, considering the guidelines, I need to assign at least 8-12 categories. Let&#39;s think about possible categories based on the content:

1. **Fashion/Style**: This is a clear domain since it&#39;s about outfit recommendations.
2. **Recommendation Systems**: The article talks about recommender systems in this context.
3. **Personalization**: The focus is on personalized recommendations.
4. **Use Cases**: It discusses various use cases, so that&#39;s a relevant category.
5. **Challenges/Opportunities**: The abstract mentions both challenges and opportunities, which are important aspects.
6. **Contextual Recommendations**: Since outfits can be in different contexts (work, evening, casual), this fits.
7. **Retail Applications**: Outfits help sell items in retail settings, so that&#39;s relevant.
8. **User Experience (UX)**: Displaying outfits coherently is about user experience.
9. **Complimentary Items Retrieval**: Although it mentions a difference from upselling, this category still applies as part of the discussion.
10. **Innovation in Recommendations**: The article talks about opportunities for innovation.

I think these cover the main themes without being too specific or too broad. Let me double-check to ensure each category is relevant and that I have enough categories.
&lt;/think&gt;
