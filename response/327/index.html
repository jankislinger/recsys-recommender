Title: Music Emotion Recognition via End-to-End Multimodal Neural Networks
Abstract:
Music emotion recognition (MER) is a key issue in user context-aware recommendation. Many existing methods require hand-crafted features on audio and lyrics. Here we propose a new end-to-end method for recognizing emotions of tracks from their acoustic signals and lyrics via multimodal deep neural networks. We evaluate our method on about 7,000 K-pop tracks labeled as positive or negative emotion. The proposed method is compared to end-to-end unimodal models using audio signals or lyrics only. The experimental results show that our multimodal model achieves the best accuracy as 80%, and we discuss the reasons of these results.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Music Emotion Recognition via End- to-End Multimodal Neural Networks.&#34; Let me start by understanding what it&#39;s about. The title suggests that the focus is on recognizing emotions in music using neural networks that handle multiple types of data (multimodal). 

Looking at the abstract, they mention it&#39;s a key issue in user context-aware recommendation. So, this ties into recommendation systems because if you can recognize the emotion of a song, you can recommend it to users based on their current mood or preferences.

The article talks about using end-to-end methods without handcrafted features, which means they&#39;re likely using deep learning models that process raw data directly. They use both audio signals and lyrics, so this is a multimodal approachâ€”combining different types of inputs (audio and text). 

They evaluated their method on around 7,000 K-pop tracks labeled as positive or negative emotions. So, the domain here is music, specifically within recommendation systems for music. The evaluation part suggests they looked at accuracy but also discuss beyond just that metric, maybe touching on aspects like diversity or user satisfaction.

Since it&#39;s about recognizing emotions in music, this relates to sentiment analysis. They compared their model with unimodal models (using only audio or lyrics), which shows an emphasis on how combining different data sources improves performance. 

So, the categories should include things like Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis because of the focus on detecting emotional content. It&#39;s part of a recommendation system, so that category is essential. Multimodal Learning fits since they use both audio and lyrics. End-to-End Deep Learning describes their approach without manual feature extraction.

Music is the primary domain here, so that should be included. They discuss accuracy but also go beyond it by explaining why their model performed well, so Beyond Accuracy makes sense. The fact that they applied this to K-pop tracks implies real-world application in music recommendation, which ties into User Context Awareness since recommendations are tailored to user contexts (like current mood). 

I need at least 8-12 categories. Let me make sure each is relevant and covers different aspects of the article without being too niche or overlapping too much. So, putting it all together: Emotion Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, Recommendation Systems, Multimodal Learning, End-to-End Deep Learning, Music, Beyond Accuracy, User Context Awareness. That&#39;s eight categories, which should be sufficient to cover the key aspects for user discoverability.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Music Emotion Recognition via End-to-End Multimodal Neural Networks&#34;. Let me read through the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions Music Emotion Recognition (MER) which is a key issue in user context-aware recommendation. So that&#39;s related to recommendation systems, specifically for music. The authors propose an end-to-end method using multimodal deep neural networks with audio signals and lyrics.

Looking at the abstract: They&#39;re focusing on recognizing emotions in tracks using both acoustic features and lyrics. Their approach uses a combination of audio and text, which is interesting because it&#39;s multimodal. They tested this on 7,000 K-pop tracks labeled as positive or negative emotion. The results show that their model achieved 80% accuracy, better than unimodal models.

So for categorization, I need to think about the key elements here. First, the main topic is recommendation systems, specifically music recommendations. They&#39;re looking at user context, which relates to personalized recommendations based on emotional context.

The method they used was a deep neural network, and it&#39;s end-to-end. So that ties into neural networks as a family of algorithms. Also, since they combined audio and lyrics, this touches on multimodal approaches in recommendation systems.

They evaluated their model using accuracy metrics and compared it to unimodal models, which relates to evaluation methods in recommendations beyond just basic accuracy. Their application is music emotion recognition, which is specific within the recommendation spaceâ€”so maybe something like &#34;Emotion Recognition&#34; as a category.

Another point is that they used real-world data (K-pop tracks), so this could be categorized under real-world applications, possibly involving user behavior or surveys since it&#39;s about how users perceive emotions in music. But I&#39;m not sure if A/B testing was mentioned; the abstract doesn&#39;t specify that, but maybe &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; is a broader category.

So putting it all together: The article deals with recommendation systems, specifically music, using neural networks and multimodal data. It touches on evaluation beyond accuracy, emotion recognition, and real-world applications in music.

I should assign categories like Recommendation Systems, Neural Networks (as the algorithm family), Multimodal Models, Music, Emotion Recognition, Evaluation Metrics, Real-World Applications. That&#39;s 7 categories so far; maybe I can add one more if possible. Looking again, since they used both audio and lyrics, maybe &#34;Multimedia&#34; could be another category. But that might not be necessaryâ€”perhaps sticking to the main points is better.

Wait, looking back at the example output in the guidelines, it&#39;s a list of keywords like Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback. So I should make sure each category is concise and relevant.

So possible categories: Recommendation Systems, Neural Networks, Multimodal Models, Music, Emotion Recognition, Evaluation Metrics, Real-World Applications. That makes sense.
&lt;/think&gt;
