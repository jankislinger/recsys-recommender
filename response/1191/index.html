Title: Exploring Coresets for Efficient Training and Consistent Evaluation of Recommender Systems
Abstract:
Recommender systems have achieved remarkable success in various web applications, such as e-commerce, online advertising, and social media, harnessing the power of big data. To attain optimal model performance, recommender systems are typically trained on very large datasets, with substantial numbers of users and items. However, large datasets often present challenges in terms of processing time and computational resources. Coreset selection offers a method for obtaining a reduced yet representative subset from vast datasets, thereby enhancing the efficiency of training machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, little research has been conducted to explore the practical implications of different coreset selection approaches on the performance of recommender systems algorithms. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of various coreset selection techniques. We evaluate the performance of the resulting coresets using inductive recommendation models which allow for consistent evaluations to be performed. The experimental results demonstrate that coreset methods are a powerful and useful approach for obtaining reduced datasets which preserve the properties of the large original dataset and have competitive performance compared to the time required to train with the full dataset.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its content. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Exploring Coresets for Efficient Training and Consistent Evaluation of Recommender Systems.&#34; From that, I can tell it&#39;s about improving recommender systems using something called coreset selection. The abstract explains that recommender systems are trained on large datasets but face challenges with processing time and resources. Coresets are a way to reduce these datasets while maintaining their representativeness.

Now, looking at the guidelines, each article should be assigned 8-12 categories. I need to think about different aspects of this research to find appropriate categories. Let me brainstorm possible areas:

1. **Algorithm Family**: The paper talks about coreset selection techniques, which falls under specific algorithms used in machine learning for dataset reduction.

2. **Evaluation Aspects**: They mention evaluating performance and consistency, so evaluation metrics are important here.

3. **Recommender Systems**: Obviously, since the focus is on improving these systems.

4. **Efficiency/Scalability**: The main goal seems to be making training more efficient with reduced datasets.

5. **Data Reduction Techniques**: Coresets themselves are a method for reducing data while preserving its properties.

6. **Machine Learning**: Since coreset selection is used in the context of machine learning models, particularly recommendation models.

7. **Big Data**: Recommender systems handle large datasets, so this category fits.

8. **Inductive Models**: The abstract mentions inductive recommendation models, which are a specific type of model used here for evaluation.

9. **Web Applications**: Recommender systems are used in web applications like e-commerce and social media.

10. **Computational Resources**: Discussing challenges with processing time and resources ties into this category.

11. **Training Efficiency**: Directly related to the efficient training aspect highlighted in the title and abstract.

I think these categories cover different angles of the research, from the specific techniques used (coresets) to broader application areas (web systems). I should ensure that each category is user-friendly and accurately reflects the content. Also, making sure there&#39;s a balance so no category is too crowded or underrepresented.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about using coresets in recommender systems. The title is &#34;Exploring Coresets for Efficient Training and Consistent Evaluation of Recommender Systems.&#34; Let me read through the abstract again to make sure I understand what it&#39;s about.

The abstract says that recommender systems are used in various web applications, like e-commerce and social media. They often use big data but face challenges with processing time and resources when training on large datasets. The paper talks about coreset selection as a method to reduce dataset size while keeping it representative, which can make training more efficient.

The authors mention that not much research has been done on how different coreset techniques affect recommender systems&#39; performance. They investigated various methods and evaluated using inductive recommendation models for consistent evaluations. Their experiments show that coresets are effective, preserving dataset properties and offering good performance with less computational time.

Okay, so the key points are about coresets, efficiency in training, evaluation consistency, and their impact on recommendation algorithms. Now, I need to map these to relevant categories as per the guidelines.

First, looking at family of algorithm: Coresets relate to data reduction techniques, which might fall under something like &#34;Dimensionality Reduction&#34; or maybe &#34;Data Compression.&#34; But since the focus is on efficiency in training machine learning models, perhaps it&#39;s more related to optimization methods. I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a specific category for coresets themselves; if so, that should be included.

Next, domain of the problem: The paper applies to recommender systems, which are used across various domains like e-commerce and social media. So categories here would include &#34;Recommender Systems,&#34; &#34;E-Commerce,&#34; and &#34;Social Media.&#34;

In terms of specific aspects within recommendation space, the use of coresets is a method for handling big data challenges, so &#34;Big Data&#34; makes sense. Also, since it&#39;s about reducing datasets without losing representativeness, maybe &#34;Efficient Training&#34; or &#34;Data Reduction Techniques.&#34; But I think in the context given, &#34;Coreset Selection&#34; might be more precise.

Aspects of evaluation mentioned include consistent evaluations using inductive models. So categories like &#34;Evaluation Methods&#34; and &#34;Inductive Recommendations.&#34;

The paper also discusses real-world applications since it&#39;s about efficiency in training which is crucial for practical systems. Therefore, &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; or something similar would fit.

Additionally, the abstract mentions the impact on performance and computational resources, so maybe &#34;Scalability,&#34; as efficient methods are scalable.

I need to ensure that each category is clear and descriptive. Let me list possible categories:

1. Coresets - specific to the technique
2. Recommender Systems - main domain
3. Big Data - relevant to dataset size
4. Efficient Training - about computational efficiency
5. Evaluation Methods - related to how performance is measured
6. Inductive Recommendations - specific evaluation method used
7. Real-World Applications - practical implications
8. Scalability - ability to handle large datasets efficiently

I think that&#39;s 8 categories. Let me make sure each fits well with the content. The paper is definitely about coresets, recommender systems, and efficiency in training. It evaluates using specific methods, which ties into evaluation methods and inductive recommendations. The real-world applications aspect is also present since they&#39;re discussing practical implications of coreset selection. Scalability makes sense because dealing with large datasets efficiently relates to scalability.

I don&#39;t think I need more than 12 categories here; the key ones are covered. Also, each category should have enough articles, but as an initial categorization, these seem appropriate.
&lt;/think&gt;

Coresets, Recommender Systems, Big Data, Efficient Training, Evaluation Methods, Inductive Recommendations, Real-World Applications, Scalability</code></pre>
