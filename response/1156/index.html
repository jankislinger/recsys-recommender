Title: Co-optimize Content Generation and Consumption in a Large Scale Video Recommendation System
Abstract:
Multi-task prediction models and value models are the de-facto standard ranking components in modern large-scale content recommendation systems. However, they are typically optimized to model users’ passive consumption behaviors, and rank content in a way to grow only consumption-centric values. In this talk, we discuss the key insight that it is possible to model sparse participatory content-generation actions as well and grow ecosystem value through a new ranking system. We made the following key technical contributions in this system: (1) introducing ranking for content generation based on a categorization of user participation actions of different sparsity, including proxy intent action or access point clicks. (2) improving sparse task prediction quality and stability by causal task relationship modeling, conditional loss modeling and ResNet based shared bottom network. (3) personalizing the value model to minimize conflicts between different values, through e.g. ranking inspiring content higher for users who actively generate content. (4) conducting systematic evaluation of proposed approach in a large short-form video UGC (User-Generated Content) platform.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on the given guidelines. The title is &#34;Co-optimize Content Generation and Consumption in a Large Scale Video Recommendation System&#34; and the abstract discusses several key points about recommendation systems, content generation, user participation, and evaluation methods.

First, looking at the family of algorithms mentioned, the abstract talks about multi-task prediction models and value models, which are common in recommendation systems. So &#34;Multi-Task Learning&#34; seems appropriate here because it involves optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously.

The domain is clearly video recommendations, so I&#39;ll add &#34;Video Recommendation.&#34; The content generation aspect also falls under this as it&#39;s a specific application within the broader recommendation space.

Next, considering the problem domain, user-generated content (UGC) is central to the discussion. Therefore, &#34;User-Generated Content&#34; is another key category.

The article discusses co-optimizing both generation and consumption, which suggests a focus on balancing different aspects of the system. This fits under &#34;Content Generation,&#34; as it&#39;s about enhancing how users create content alongside consuming it.

Looking at evaluation aspects, the abstract mentions systematic evaluations conducted in a large-scale platform. So categories like &#34;Evaluation Metrics&#34; and &#34;Large-Scale Systems&#34; are relevant here because they highlight both the methods used to assess the system and the scale at which it operates.

The technical contributions include causal task relationship modeling and shared bottom networks. These are specific techniques within recommendation systems, so I&#39;ll categorize them under &#34;Causal Modeling&#34; and &#34;Network Architecture.&#34;

User participation is a significant theme, as the model considers different types of user actions. Therefore, &#34;User Participation&#34; makes sense to capture this aspect.

Lastly, while the example includes categories like &#34;Scalability,&#34; it&#39;s less emphasized in the abstract. However, since the system operates at scale, including it might still be beneficial for discoverability. Similarly, terms like &#34;Content Creation&#34; and &#34;User-Centric Design&#34; are somewhat covered but not as prominently as others.

Putting this all together, I&#39;ve identified several categories that cover both the technical aspects, specific functionalities, evaluation methods, and the domain of application.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. Let&#39;s start by reading through them carefully.

The title is &#34;Co-optimize Content Generation and Consumption in a Large Scale Video Recommendation System.&#34; From the title, it seems like the focus is on optimizing both content generation and consumption within video recommendations. So that gives me some initial categories: probably something related to recommendation systems and maybe content generation.

Looking at the abstract, the article talks about multi-task prediction models and value models being standard in modern recommendation systems. They mention these models are optimized for passive user behaviors, leading to growth in consumption-centric values. The key insight here is modeling sparse participatory content-generation actions to grow ecosystem value through a new ranking system.

So they&#39;ve made several technical contributions: 

1. Ranking for content generation based on user participation actions of different sparsity levels, including proxy intent actions or access point clicks.
2. Improving sparse task prediction quality and stability using causal task relationship modeling, conditional loss modeling, and ResNet-based shared bottom networks.
3. Personalizing the value model to minimize conflicts between different values, like ranking inspiring content higher for users who actively generate content.
4. Evaluating the approach on a large short-form video UGC (User-Generated Content) platform.

From this, I can extract several categories. 

First, the domain is definitely Video Recommendation Systems since it&#39;s about recommendations in video platforms. Short-form videos are mentioned specifically as the application area, so that should be another category: Short-form Videos.

The article deals with content generation alongside consumption, which points to Content Generation and Consumption Optimization as a category. They&#39;re co-optimizing these two aspects.

They talk about multi-task prediction models and ranking systems, so Multi-task Learning and Ranking Models are relevant here.

Sparse participatory actions refer to user behaviors that are not very frequent but still important for content generation. So Sparse Actions or Sparse Participation would be another category.

Causal task relationship modeling is mentioned in their technical contributions, which relates to causal inference and causality in machine learning models. That&#39;s a good category: Causality.

ResNet-based shared bottom networks indicate the use of deep learning architectures, particularly ResNet, so Deep Learning Architectures fits here. They&#39;re using these for their model architecture.

Personalizing the value model based on user behaviors, especially active content generation, suggests that Personalization and User-Centered Design are key aspects. So I&#39;ll add those categories.

They conducted evaluations on a large UGC platform, which ties into Real-World Applications since it&#39;s about applying the model in a real-world setting like YouTube Shorts. 

Another point is their focus on ecosystem value and user participation, which relates to Community Engagement because they&#39;re looking at how users engage with content generation.

Lastly, since they are improving recommendations by considering both consumption and generation, Recommendation System Optimization is directly relevant.

Let me list these categories again to make sure I didn&#39;t miss anything:

- Video Recommendation Systems
- Short-form Videos
- Content Generation
- Multi-task Learning
- Ranking Models
- Sparse Actions
- Causality
- Deep Learning Architectures
- Personalization
- Real-World Applications
- Community Engagement
- Recommendation System Optimization

I think these cover the main points from the abstract. Each category is relevant and specific enough, ensuring that users can navigate based on their interests. I made sure to include both high-level categories like Video Recommendation Systems and more specific ones like Sparse Actions and Causality. This should help in making the interface user-friendly and navigable.
&lt;/think&gt;

- Video Recommendation Systems
- Short-form Videos
- Content Generation
- Multi-task Learning
- Ranking Models
- Sparse Actions
- Causality
- Deep Learning Architectures
- Personalization
- Real-World Applications
- Community Engagement
- Recommendation System Optimization</code></pre>
