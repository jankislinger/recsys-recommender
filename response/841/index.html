        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Okay, I need to categorize this article about Zillow&#39;s volume governance for emails and push messages. Let me start by understanding the content.

The title mentions &#34;Volume Governing&#34; which suggests it&#39;s about managing the number of messages sent. The abstract talks about a system used at Zillow in production, dealing with practical issues and lessons learned.

So, first, this is about email and push notifications. That falls under Communication Channels. It&#39;s specific to messages, so maybe Message Volume Control as another category.

The article discusses managing user engagement without overwhelming them, which ties into User Engagement strategies. It&#39;s a case study from Zillow, so including that company name makes sense for context.

It&#39;s about system design and practical implementation in production, so System Design and Production Systems are relevant categories. Lessons learned imply it&#39;s about best practices, so Best Practices should be included.

The article likely discusses monitoring to ensure the right volume of messages, so Monitoring is another category. It&#39;s a real-world application example, making Real-World Applications appropriate.

Putting it all together, I think these categories cover the article&#39;s content effectively.
&lt;/think&gt;

Communication Channels, Email Management, Push Notifications, Volume Control, User Engagement, System Design, Production Systems, Best Practices, Monitoring, Real-World Applications, Zillow</code></pre>
