Title: Promoting Two-sided Fairness with Adaptive Weights for Providers and Customers in Recommendation
Abstract:
At present, most recommender systems involve two stakeholders, providers and customers. Apart from maximizing the recommendation accuracy, the fairness issue for both sides should also be considered. However, there is a trade-off for multi-objective optimization problems, where optimizing one objective (e.g. provider-side fairness) may degrade the performance of others (e.g. accuracy). Most of previous studies try to improve two-sided fairness with post-processing algorithms or fairness-aware loss constraints, which are highly dependent on the heuristic adjustments without respect to the optimization goal of accuracy. In contrast, we propose a novel training framework, adaptive weighting  towards two-sided fairness-aware recommendation (named Ada2Fair), which lies in the extension of the accuracy-focused objective to a controllable preference learning loss over the interaction data. Specifically, we adjust the optimization scale of an interaction sample with an adaptive weight generator, and estimate the two-sided fairness-aware weights within model training. During the training process, the recommender is trained with two-sided fairness-aware weights to boost the utility of niche providers and inactive customers in a unified way. Extensive experiments on three public datasets verify the effectiveness of Ada2Fair, which can achieve Pareto improvements in two-sided fairness-aware recommendation. Our code implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Ada2Fair.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

The title is &#34;Promoting Two- s Fairness with Adaptive Weights for Providers and Customers in Recommendation.&#34; So it&#39;s about fairness in recommendation systems, specifically considering both providers and customers.

Looking at the abstract, they mention that most recommender systems involve two stakeholders: providers and customers. The main focus is on maximizing recommendation accuracy while also addressing fairness issues on both sides. They talk about a trade-off in multi-objective optimization where improving one aspect might degrade another. Previous studies used post-processing or loss constraints, but this approach requires heuristic adjustments without focusing much on accuracy.

The authors propose a new training framework called Ada2Fair, which extends the accuracy-focused objective to include a preference learning loss that&#39;s controllable. They use an adaptive weight generator to adjust the optimization scale for each interaction sample and estimate fairness-aware weights during model training. The goal is to boost the utility for niche providers and inactive customers in a unified manner.

They conducted experiments on three public datasets, showing that Ada2Fair achieves Pareto improvements in two-sided fairness-aware recommendation.

Now, I&#39;ll break this down into potential categories:

1. **Algorithm Family**: They mention using adaptive weighting as part of their framework. So, Adaptive Weights is a key algorithm component.
2. **Domain of Problem**: The problem involves both providers and customers, which falls under the general domain of Recommender Systems.
3. **Specific Recommendation Aspect**: Fairness is a specific aspect here, so Two-sided Fairness is relevant.
4. **Evaluation Aspects**: They discuss improving both accuracy and fairness without one degrading the other, implying multi-objective optimization.
5. **Real-world Application**: The framework was tested on public datasets, showing practical application in recommendation scenarios.
6. **Other Relevant Categories**: They talk about optimization techniques, so Optimization Techniques is another category. Also, since they address inactive customers and niche providers, this relates to User-Centric Design.

I should ensure each article is assigned at least 8-12 categories. Let me list them out:

- Adaptive Weights: Directly from their proposed framework.
- Recommender Systems: The overall domain.
- Fairness: Central theme of the research.
- Two-sided Fairness: Specific type of fairness addressed.
- Multi-objective Optimization: As they balance multiple objectives.
- Recommendation Frameworks: Since they developed a new framework (Ada2Fair).
- Provider-Customer Dynamics: Focus on both stakeholders.
- User-Centric Design: Addressing inactive users and niche providers.
- Real-world Applications: Tested with public datasets, indicating practical use.
- Adaptive Learning: Part of their weight adjustment approach.
- Evaluation Metrics: They discuss performance improvements in fairness and accuracy.

That&#39;s 11 categories. I think this covers the necessary aspects without being too broad or too narrow. Each category is relevant to different facets of the article, ensuring discoverability for various user interests.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

The title of the article is &#34;Promoting Two-sided Fairness with Adaptive Weights for Providers and Customers in Recommendation.&#34; From the title, it&#39;s clear that the focus is on recommendation systems, specifically dealing with fairness from both providers&#39; and customers&#39; perspectives. The abstract adds more details: it discusses a novel training framework called Ada2Fair, which adjusts weights adaptively to improve two-sided fairness without compromising accuracy. It mentions multi-objective optimization, adaptive weighting, and improving utility for niche providers and inactive users.

Now, looking at the guidelines provided, I need to assign each article to at least 8-12 categories. The categories should be specific but broad enough to be useful, ensuring balanced distribution across them.

Starting with the obvious ones:
1. **Recommendation Systems**: This is central to the article&#39;s topic.
2. **Fairness in AI/ML**: Since it deals with fairness issues in recommendations.

Next, considering the methodology and approach:
3. **Adaptive Algorithms**: The use of adaptive weights suggests this category.
4. **Multi-objective Optimization**: As the abstract mentions trade-offs between different objectives like accuracy and fairness.

Looking deeper into the problem domain:
5. **Two-sided Marketplaces**: Recommenders often involve two stakeholders, so this is relevant.
6. **Provider-Customer Dynamics**: Directly related to the interactions between providers and customers in recommendations.

Evaluation aspects might include:
7. **Utility Maximization**: The article aims to boost utility for niche providers and inactive users.
8. **Beyond Accuracy**: It emphasizes fairness alongside accuracy, which falls under this category.

Real-world applications are another angle:
9. **Real-World Applications**: Although the abstract doesn&#39;t specify an application, the framework could be applied in various domains.

Specific recommendation techniques might include:
10. **Provider Recommendations**: Focusing on how providers are recommended.
11. **Customer-Centric Recommendations**: Tailoring recommendations to customer needs.

The article&#39;s approach is innovative in balancing multiple objectives:
12. **Balanced Optimization**: It seeks a Pareto improvement, which ties into this category.

Putting it all together, I have 12 categories that cover the main aspects of the article, ensuring each is relevant and contributes to user navigation.
&lt;/think&gt;

Two-Sided Fairness, Adaptive Algorithms, Multi-Objective Optimization, Recommendation Systems, Provider-Customer Dynamics, Utility Maximization, Two-Sided Marketplaces, Beyond Accuracy, Real-World Applications, Provider Recommendations, Customer-Centric Recommendations, Balanced Optimization</code></pre>
