        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: AnnoMathTeX â€“ a Formula Identifier Annotation Recommender System for STEM Documents
Abstract:
Documents from science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) often contain a large number of mathematical formulae alongside text. Semantic search, recommender, and question answering systems require the occurring formula constants and variables (identifiers) to be disambiguated. We present a first implementation of a recommender system that enables and accelerates formula annotation by displaying the most likely candidates for formula and identifier names from four different sources (arXiv, Wikipedia, Wikidata, or the surrounding text). A first evaluation shows that in total, 78% of the formula identifier name recommendations were accepted by the user as a suitable annotation. Furthermore, document-wide annotation saved the user the annotation of ten times more other identifier occurrences. Our long-term vision is to integrate the annotation recommender into the edit-view of Wikipedia and the online LaTeX editor Overleaf.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about AnnoMathTeX. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions it&#39;s a &#34;Formula Identifier Annotation Recommender System for STEM Documents.&#34; So right away, I can tell this is related to recommendation systems, specifically in the context of STEM documents which deal with mathematical formulas.

Looking at the abstract, they talk about semantic search, recommender systems, and question answering. These are all key areas, so I should include those as categories. The system helps annotate formula identifiers by suggesting names from sources like arXiv, Wikipedia, Wikidata, and surrounding text. That collaborative aspect suggests it&#39;s using a collaborative filtering approach, which is another category.

The evaluation part mentions that 78% of recommendations were accepted, which indicates they&#39;re focusing on user acceptance or satisfaction. Also, the fact that document-wide annotation saved users from annotating ten times more identifiers shows an emphasis on efficiency and reducing effort, so efficiency should be a category.

They plan to integrate this into Wikipedia&#39;s edit view and Overleaf, which are both real-world applications. So A/B testing might not apply here unless they did some user tests, but the mention of user surveys in the example categories makes me think that user feedback was involved, hence User Survey as a category.

The domain is clearly STEM documents, so that&#39;s another category. Since it involves mathematical formulas and identifiers, Formula Annotation is specific to their work. The system uses multiple sources for recommendations, which is multi-source recommendation, adding another layer of categorization.

I should also consider the aspects like improving search capabilities in STEM fields, so maybe Semantic Search as a separate category. Additionally, since they&#39;re helping users by suggesting annotations automatically, that&#39;s automated annotation.

Putting it all together, I think these categories cover the article well without being too narrow or too broad. They provide enough context for users to find the article relevant under different search criteria.
&lt;/think&gt;
