Title: Adversarial Sleeping Bandit Problems with Multiple Plays: Algorithm and Ranking Application
Abstract:
This paper presents an efficient algorithm to solve the sleeping bandit with multiple plays problem in the context of an online recommendation system. The problem involves bounded, adversarial loss and unknown i.i.d. distributions for arm availability. The proposed algorithm extends the sleeping bandit algorithm for single arm selection and is guaranteed to achieve theoretical performance with regret upper bounded by $\bigO(kN^2\sqrt{T\log T})$, where $k$ is the number of arms selected per time step, $N$ is the total number of arms, and $T$ is the time horizon.

Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: &#34;Adversarial Sleeping Bandit Problems with Multiple Plays: Algorithm and Ranking Application.&#34; The key terms here are adversarial sleeping bandit, multiple plays, algorithm, and ranking application. So I know this is about a specific type of bandit problem in machine learning, particularly dealing with adversarial environments and multiple selections at each time step.

Now the abstract mentions an efficient algorithm for solving sleeping bandits with multiple plays in online recommendation systems. It talks about bounded adversarial loss and unknown i.i.d. distributions for arm availability. The proposed algorithm extends a single-arm selection method and has a regret bound of O(kN²√(T log T)).

So, I need to map this into categories. Let&#39;s start with the family of algorithms. Since it&#39;s about bandits, specifically sleeping bandits, that&#39;s one category. Multi-armed bandits is another because it involves multiple arms (options) and selection strategies. The use of adversarial loss suggests an adversarial approach in machine learning.

The problem domain here is online recommendation systems, so that&#39;s a clear category. But since the application is ranking within recommendations, I should include both &#34;Recommendation&#34; and &#34;Ranking.&#34;

Looking at aspects like evaluation, the paper mentions regret bounds and theoretical performance. So &#34;Regret Analysis&#34; and &#34;Theoretical Analysis&#34; are relevant.

The problem involves multiple plays per time step, so &#34;Multiple Plays&#34; is another category. It&#39;s an adversarial setting, so &#34;Adversarial Machine Learning&#34; fits here too.

Considering real-world applications, the paper talks about online recommendation systems and ranking, which indicates practical implementations beyond just theory. So &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; should be included.

I also think about the scalability aspect because the algorithm is efficient for a large number of arms (N), so &#34;Scalability&#34; makes sense. Since it&#39;s dealing with multiple options or items being selected each time, &#34;Multi-Item Selection&#34; is another category.

Now, to ensure coverage across different angles without overlapping too much: I have bandit algorithms, recommendation systems, ranking, adversarial methods, regret analysis, scalability, real applications, and multi-item selection. That gives me a comprehensive set of categories that should help users find this article when exploring related topics.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to figure out how to categorize this research article. The title is &#34;Adversarial Sleeping Bandit Problems with Multiple Plays: Algorithm and Ranking Application.&#34; The abstract mentions it&#39;s about an efficient algorithm for a sleeping bandit problem in an online recommendation system. It deals with bounded adversarial loss and unknown i.i.d distributions for arm availability. The proposed algorithm extends the single-arm selection method and has a specific regret upper bound.

First, I&#39;ll break down the key elements from the title and abstract. The main topics seem to revolve around bandit algorithms, specifically the sleeping bandit variant with multiple plays. Since it&#39;s about recommendation systems, that&#39;s another category. The algorithm handles adversarial losses, which falls under robustness or adversarial settings in machine learning.

Looking at the categories provided as examples: Family of algorithm (e.g., Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits), Domain of problem (e.g., Healthcare, Education), Specific aspects in recommendation space (e.g., Cold Start), Evaluation aspects (e.g., Diversity), and real-world applications like A/B Testing or User Surveys.

Applying these to the current article:

1. **Family of Algorithm**: Multi-Armed Bandits is a clear fit since the paper deals with bandit problems.
2. **Domain of Problem**: Online recommendation systems, so Recommendation Systems fits here.
3. **Specific Aspect in Recommendation Space**: The problem involves multiple plays, which implies selecting more than one arm per step, so that&#39;s Multiple Plays.
4. **Evaluation Aspects**: It mentions regret upper bounds, which relates to the theoretical performance and evaluation metrics like Regret Analysis.
5. **Real-World Applications**: Since it&#39;s applied in an online recommendation system, Ranking Application is relevant as part of its application area.

I should also consider if there are other aspects. The problem is adversarial, so maybe something related to Adversarial Settings or Robustness. However, the user provided categories didn&#39;t list these explicitly, but the existing ones seem sufficient.

Another thought: Is there anything about scalability? The paper mentions efficiency but doesn&#39;t specify scalability in terms of computational resources, so maybe it&#39;s not necessary here. Similarly, aspects like diversity or beyond accuracy aren&#39;t highlighted unless they&#39;re part of the evaluation framework, which isn&#39;t clear from the abstract.

So, sticking to the main points: Multi-Armed Bandits as the algorithm family, Recommendation Systems and Ranking Application for domain and application, Multiple Plays for the specific bandit variant, and Regret Analysis for the evaluation aspect. Also, since it&#39;s an adversarial setting, maybe that could be another category, but I don&#39;t recall seeing that in the examples given.

Wait, the user&#39;s example included categories like Scalability, Web Systems, etc., so perhaps Adversarial Settings is a valid category too, as the problem deals with adversarial loss. But if I stick strictly to the example categories provided earlier, maybe it&#39;s better not to include unless it&#39;s necessary. However, in the output, the user asked for just the list of keywords without explanation.

So, to recap, the categories would be:

- Multi-Armed Bandits (algorithm family)
- Online Recommendation Systems (domain)
- Multiple Plays (specific bandit problem)
- Regret Analysis (evaluation aspect)
- Ranking Application (application area)

I think that&#39;s five categories. The user suggested 8-12, but based on the example given, sometimes fewer are used as well. Since I don&#39;t see more obvious categories from the abstract, these should suffice.
&lt;/think&gt;
