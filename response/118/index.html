        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Asymmetric Recommendations: The Interacting Effects of Social Ratings’ Direction and Strength on Users’ Ratings
Abstract:
In social recommendation systems, users often publicly rate objects such as photos, news articles or consumer products. When they appear in aggregate, these ratings carry social signals such as the direction and strength of the raters’ average opinion about the product. Using a controlled experiment we manipulated two central social signals – the direction and strength of social ratings of five popular consumer products – and examined their interacting effects on users’ ratings. The results show an asymmetric user behavior, where the direction of perceived social rating has a negative effect on users’ ratings if the direction of perceived social rating is negative, but no effect if the direction is positive. The strength of perceived social ratings did not have a significant effect on users’ ratings. The findings highlight the potential for cascading adverse effects of small number of negative user ratings on subsequent users’ opinions.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its content and user-centric design principles. Let&#39;s start by analyzing the title and abstract provided.

The title is &#34;Asymmetric Recommendations: The Interacting Effects of Social Ratings’ Direction and Strength on Users’ Ratings.&#34; This suggests that the article discusses how social ratings impact user behavior in recommendation systems, particularly focusing on direction (positive vs. negative) and strength (how many or how strong those ratings are). The word &#34;asymmetric&#34; indicates that there&#39;s a difference in effect depending on whether the social signal is positive or negative.

Looking at the abstract: It mentions a controlled experiment manipulating two central social signals—direction and strength of social ratings—and examines their effects on users&#39; ratings. Key findings include an asymmetric user behavior where negative perceived social ratings have a negative effect, but positive ones don&#39;t significantly influence users. The study also points out potential cascading adverse effects from a small number of negative ratings.

Now, I&#39;ll map these elements to possible categories:

1. **Social Recommendation Systems**: Directly related since the article discusses how social signals (ratings) affect recommendations.
2. **User Behavior Analysis**: Focuses on how users react to social signals, which is about their behavior in the system.
3. **Rating Behavior**: Deals with how users assign ratings and how these are influenced by others.
4. **Social Signals**: Central to the study as it manipulates direction and strength of these signals.
5. **Controlled Experiments**: The research uses a controlled setting, which is an important method in evaluation.
6. **Recommendation Algorithms**: While not explicitly detailed, understanding how social signals affect recommendations ties into algorithm design considerations.
7. **Negative Ratings Impact**: Highlights the asymmetric effect where negative ratings have a stronger impact than positive ones.
8. **Asymmetric Effects**: The core finding about asymmetry should be its own category.
9. **User Influence in Recommendations**: Deals with how users influence each other&#39;s opinions through ratings.

I considered whether to include more specific terms like &#34;Cascading Effects&#34; but it might be too narrow. Instead, capturing the broader impact under &#34;Negative Ratings Impact&#34; seems sufficient. Also, ensuring categories are user-friendly and relevant for navigation is key, so avoiding overly technical jargon unless necessary.

Finally, I need to ensure that each category is clear and descriptive without being too vague or too specific, balancing discoverability with ease of use.
