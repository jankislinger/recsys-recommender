        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Towards Understanding The Gaps of Offline And Online Evaluation Metrics: Impact of Series vs. Movie Recommendations
Abstract:
In the realm of recommender systems research, offline evaluation metrics like NDCG, Recall, or Precision are often used to measure the impact. On the other hand, common industry practices suggest evaluating new ideas/models through A/B tests where decisions are made based on business metrics like the overall engagement of users. A new model may show improvement in offline metrics but performance loss in online metrics. One reason that leads to this phenomenon is the counterfactual nature of the recommendation problem which can be addressed by off-policy evaluation methods. Another reason is the degree of causal connection between offline evaluation metrics and observed online metrics. In this work, we will share our learnings from two sets of A/B tests that we conducted at Max1 where we observed a mismatch between online and offline metrics due to a weak causal connection between online and offline metrics. Thanks to learnings from A/B tests, we discovered and quantified the impact of series to movie ratio at recommendations. Our experiments show that there is an optimal amount of series to movies ratio that provides the best possible results for user engagement

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by understanding what the article is about.

The title mentions &#34;Towards Understanding The Gaps of Offline And Online Evaluation Metrics: Impact of Series vs. Movie Recommendations.&#34; So it&#39;s comparing offline metrics like NDCG, Recall, Precision with online metrics from A/B tests. It also talks about series versus movie recommendations, which indicates a focus on content types within recommendation systems.

Looking at the abstract, they conducted A/B tests at Max1 and found mismatches between online and offline metrics due to weak causal connections. They discovered an optimal ratio of series to movies for user engagement. So this is about evaluation methods in recommender systems, specifically comparing how offline testing (like using standard metrics) differs from real-world testing through A/B experiments.

Now, I need to assign categories according to the guidelines: at least 8-12 categories, clear and relevant labels. Let&#39;s brainstorm possible categories:

1. **Evaluation Metrics**: Since the article discusses both offline and online evaluation methods.
2. **Offline Evaluation**: Focused on metrics like NDCG, Recall, Precision.
3. **Online Evaluation**: Refers to A/B testing in real-world settings.
4. **Recommender Systems**: The main domain of study here.
5. **A/B Testing**: Mentioned as a key method used in the research.
6. **User Engagement**: The outcome measured in their experiments.
7. **Content Types**: Specifically deals with series vs. movies, so content types are relevant.
8. **Causal Inference**: Talks about causal connections between metrics.
9. **Business Metrics**: Since A/B tests use business outcomes like engagement.
10. **Movie Recommendations**: Directly related to the case study in the abstract.
11. **Series Recommendations**: Similarly, it&#39;s a specific content type they tested.
12. **Optimal Content Ratio**: They found an optimal series-to-movies ratio.

Wait, some of these might overlap or be too specific. Let me check:

- &#34;Content Types&#34; is broad enough to cover both movies and series.
- &#34;Movie Recommendations&#34; and &#34;Series Recommendations&#34; could be separate if they are distinct categories, but maybe combining them under a broader category like &#34;Media Type Recommendations&#34; would make sense. However, since the article specifically contrasts them, it&#39;s better to keep them as separate categories for clarity.

I should ensure that each category is distinct and accurately reflects the content. Let me list them again:

1. **Evaluation Metrics**: Covers both offline and online metrics.
2. **Offline Evaluation**: Specifics on NDCG, Recall, Precision.
3. **Online Evaluation**: Focuses on A/B testing results.
4. **Recommender Systems**: The main area of study.
5. **A/B Testing**: Key methodology used.
6. **User Engagement**: Primary metric measured.
7. **Content Types**: Encompassing both movies and series.
8. **Causal Inference**: Discusses causal connections between metrics.
9. **Business Metrics**: As A/B tests use business outcomes.
10. **Movie Recommendations**: Specific content type analysis.
11. **Series Recommendations**: Another specific content type.

I think that&#39;s 11 categories, which fits the guideline of 8-12. I should ensure each category is clear and relevant without being too narrow or overlapping excessively.

Double-checking the example output provided earlier: &#34;Evaluation Metrics, Offline Evaluation, Online Evaluation, Recommender Systems, A/B Testing, User Engagement, Content Types, Causal Inference, Business Metrics, Movie Recommendations, Series Recommendations.&#34; That looks comprehensive and adheres to the guidelines.
&lt;/think&gt;

Evaluation Metrics, Offline Evaluation, Online Evaluation, Recommender Systems, A/B Testing, User Engagement, Content Types, Causal Inference, Business Metrics, Movie Recommendations, Series Recommendations</code></pre>
