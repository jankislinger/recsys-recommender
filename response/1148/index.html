Title: Personal Values and Community-Centric Environmental Recommender Systems: enhancing Sustainability through User Engagement
Abstract:
The concept of sustainability has become a central focus across multiple sectors, driven by the urgent need to address climate change and protect the environment. Technological advancements and capabilities, together with the emergence of new ecological issues, are leading to growing awareness and influencing shifts in multiple areas such as energy, transportation, and waste management. Within this context, the roles of recommender systems represent a promising solution, since people need guidance and occasionally a gentle push to translate their intentions into actions or to bring goals to life. However, existing literature reveals a fragmented landscape, with solutions often addressing specific aspects or recommendation contribution in isolation. Many sustainability interventions focus solely on providing consumption data and environmental insights, while others emphasize learning and behavior change strategies. My doctoral project aims to address this gap by leveraging various approaches to recommender systems and applying them in sustainability contexts, with the goal to build a holistic system that maximizes the contributions of these diverse methods, also integrating user-centric and value-driven perspectives. This research project delves into two distinct facets: energy sustainability and sustainable mobility. The first case centers on enhancing energy efficiency within energy communities through personalized recommendations and engagement strategies. The second facet focuses on reshaping user commuting patterns towards sustainable alternatives, by recommending suitable and more sustainable modes of transportation, such as cycling, carpooling, and public transportation. Both cases share the same objective: align user behaviors with sustainability goals, thereby reducing individual environmental impact and enhancing the sense of belonging to a community, whether this is confined to a group of individuals or pertains to society at large. An innovative comprehensive recommendation system approach is highly beneficial since it can take advantage of all the existing contributions combined in a framework that makes at the same time different types of recommendations: explainable, educative, behavioral and social-aware, addressing the complexities of this multifaceted domain.

Alright, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about environmental recommender systems. The title mentions personal values and community-centric approaches, focusing on sustainability through user engagement. The abstract talks about using recommender systems in energy and mobility contexts.

First, looking at the family of algorithms, it doesn&#39;t specify any particular ones like matrix factorization or neural networks. It&#39;s more about the application, so maybe I can skip that category for now.

The domain here is clearly environmental sustainability, both in terms of energy efficiency and sustainable mobility. That gives me two categories right away: Environmental Sustainability and Sustainable Mobility.

It mentions integrating various recommendation strategiesâ€”explainable, educative, behavioral, and social-aware. So, those are specific aspects of the recommendation space I should include as categories.

The project involves enhancing user engagement and aligning personal values with community goals, which points to User-Centric Design and Value-Driven Approaches. Also, it&#39;s about building a sense of belonging in a community, so Community Engagement is relevant.

It addresses the fragmentation in existing literature by integrating diverse methods into a holistic system. That suggests the categories are looking at both fragmented approaches and a more integrated framework, so Fragmented Approaches and Integrated Frameworks make sense.

The focus on energy efficiency within communities falls under Energy Efficiency and Energy Communities. The real-world applications involve A/B testing or user surveys, but the abstract doesn&#39;t mention these specifically. I might hold off on adding those unless they&#39;re clearly stated.

Putting it all together: Environmental Sustainability is a broad category, while Sustainable Mobility and Energy Efficiency are more specific. User-Centric Design and Value-Driven Approaches highlight the focus on personalization and alignment with user values. Community Engagement and Social-Aware Recommendations emphasize the social aspects of the system. The recommendation strategies cover Explainable, Educative, Behavioral, which are specific types. Lastly, addressing fragmented approaches and creating an integrated framework ties back to how the research is structured.

I think that&#39;s a solid set covering both broad and specific areas relevant to the article.
&lt;/think&gt;

Environmental Sustainability, Sustainable Mobility, Energy Efficiency, Community Engagement, User-Centric Design, Value-Driven Approaches, Recommender Systems, Integrated Frameworks, Explainable Recommendations, Educative Recommendations, Behavioral Change, Social-Aware Recommendations, Fragmented Approaches</code></pre>

Okay, I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. The title mentions &#34;Personal Values and Community-Centric Environmental Recommender Systems&#34; focusing on sustainability through user engagement. Let me go through the key points.

First, the article talks about recommender systems in the context of sustainability, specifically energy and transportation. So, that&#39;s clearly within the recommendation domain. I&#39;ll add &#34;Recommender Systems&#34; as a category.

It also discusses environmental impact and sustainability goals, so those are relevant categories: &#34;Environmental Impact&#34; and &#34;Sustainability.&#34;

The focus is on community-centric systems, which means it&#39;s about building communities or fostering social aspects. So, &#34;Community-Centric&#34; makes sense.

Personal values play a role here since the system considers user values for recommendations. Therefore, adding &#34;Personal Values&#34; as a category is appropriate.

Behavior change strategies are mentioned because the recommender system aims to influence user actions towards sustainability. That&#39;s another category: &#34;Behavior Change.&#34;

The article deals with energy efficiency and sustainable mobility. These are specific domains, so I&#39;ll include both &#34;Energy Efficiency&#34; and &#34;Sustainable Mobility.&#34;

Explainable recommendations are highlighted as part of their approach, so &#34;Explainability&#34; should be a category.

Lastly, user engagement is a key aspect because the system aims to engage users in sustainable practices, making &#34;User Engagement&#34; another relevant category.

I think these categories cover the main themes without overlapping too much and provide enough discoverability.
&lt;/think&gt;

Community-Centric, Recommender Systems, Sustainability, Environmental Impact, Personal Values, Behavior Change, Energy Efficiency, Sustainable Mobility, Explainability, User Engagement</code></pre>
