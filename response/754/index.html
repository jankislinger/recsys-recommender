        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Don’t recommend the obvious: estimate probability ratios
Abstract:
Sequential recommender systems are becoming widespread in the online retail and streaming industry. These systems are often trained to predict the next item given a sequence of a user’s recent actions, and standard evaluation metrics reward systems that can identify the most probable items that might appear next. However, some recent papers instead evaluate recommendation systems with popularity-sampled metrics, which measure how well the model can find a user’s next item when hidden amongst generally-popular items. We argue that these popularity-sampled metrics are more appropriate for recommender systems, because the most probable items for a user often include generally-popular items. If the probability that a customer will watch Toy Story is not much more probable than for the average customer, then the movie isn’t especially relevant for them and we should not recommend it. This paper shows that optimizing popularity-sampled metrics is closely related to estimating point-wise mutual information (PMI). We propose and compare two techniques to fit PMI directly, which both improve popularity-sampled metrics for state-of-the-art recommender systems. The improvements are large compared to differences between recently-proposed model architectures.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its content and the guidelines provided. Let me start by carefully reading through the title and abstract.

The title is &#34;Don’t recommend the obvious: estimate probability ratios.&#34; The abstract discusses sequential recommender systems used in online retail and streaming. It mentions that these systems predict the next item a user might take, but current evaluation metrics reward identifying highly probable items. However, the paper argues that using popularity-sampled metrics is better because sometimes the most probable items are just popular ones, not necessarily relevant to the specific user.

The authors propose evaluating how well a model can find a user&#39;s next item when it&#39;s hidden among popular ones. They argue that if an item isn&#39;t much more probable for a user than average, it shouldn&#39;t be recommended. The paper connects optimizing these metrics to estimating point-wise mutual information (PMI) and proposes two techniques to fit PMI directly, which improves the recommendation systems&#39; performance significantly.

Now, I&#39;ll break down the key elements from the article:

1. **Sequential Recommender Systems**: This is a specific type of recommendation system that uses user&#39;s recent actions to predict next items.
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: The paper discusses traditional metrics and introduces popularity-sampled metrics as better alternatives.
3. **Popularity-Sampled Metrics**: A method for evaluating recommendations by considering popular items, ensuring the recommended items are genuinely relevant.
4. **Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI)**: A statistical measure used to assess the strength of the relationship between two events. Here, it&#39;s applied to improve recommendation quality.
5. **Recommendation Algorithms**: The paper proposes techniques to fit PMI directly, which affects how recommendations are generated and evaluated.

Considering these points, I&#39;ll map them to relevant categories:

- **Sequential Recommender Systems**: This is a specific category as the article focuses on this type of system.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The discussion on different metrics used to assess recommendation systems fits here.
- **Popularity-Sampled Metrics**: A new or specific metric discussed in the paper, important for evaluation.
- **Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI)**: A technique used within the recommendation algorithm.
- **Recommendation Algorithms**: The core area where these techniques are applied.

Additionally, considering other aspects:

- **Recommender Systems**: Broad category that encompasses all recommendations, which this article is about.
- **Algorithm Design**: Since they&#39;re proposing new methods to fit PMI, this relates to how the algorithms are designed.
- **Beyond Accuracy**: The paper goes beyond just accuracy in evaluation by considering relevance and popularity.

Putting it all together, the categories should cover both broad areas (like Recommender Systems) and specific techniques or aspects discussed (like Sequential Recommender Systems, Evaluation Metrics, Popularity-Sampled Metrics). Including terms like Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI), Algorithm Design, and Beyond Accuracy ensures that the categorization is comprehensive and useful for users looking into specific evaluation methods or algorithmic approaches.
