        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Less is More: Towards Sustainability-Aware Persuasive Explanations in Recommender Systems
Abstract:
Recommender systems play an important role in supporting the achievement of the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs). In recommender systems, explanations can support different goals, such as increasing a user’s trust in a recommendation, persuading a user to purchase specific items, or increasing the understanding of the reasons behind a recommendation. In this paper, we discuss the concept of “sustainability-aware persuasive explanations” which we regard as a major concept to support the achievement of the mentioned SDGs. Such explanations are orthogonal to most existing explanation approaches since they focus on a “less is more” principle, which per se is not included in existing e-commerce platforms. Based on a user study in three item domains, we analyze the potential impacts of sustainability-aware persuasive explanations. The study results are promising regarding user acceptance and the potential impacts of such explanations.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories as per the guidelines provided. Let&#39;s start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Less is More: Towards Sustainability-Aware Persuasive Explanations in Recommender Systems.&#34; The focus seems to be on how explanations within recommender systems can promote sustainability, aligning with the United Nations&#39; SDGs.

Looking at the abstract, it mentions that explanations in recommender systems serve various purposes like increasing user trust and persuasion. The article introduces &#34;sustainability-aware persuasive explanations&#34; which follow a &#34;less is more&#34; principle, something not commonly found in e-commerce platforms. They conducted a user study across three domains to assess the impact on user acceptance.

Now, I&#39;ll map this to possible categories:

1. **Sustainability**: This is central as the paper discusses using recommendations to support SDGs.
2. **Recommender Systems**: The primary focus area of the research.
3. **User Trust**: Explanations aim to increase trust in recommendations.
4. **Persuasion**: They&#39;re exploring how explanations persuade users towards sustainable choices.
5. **Explanation Methods**: The article discusses specific types of explanations, so this is relevant.
6. **User Studies**: Since they conducted a study across three domains.
7. **Ethical Considerations**: The integration of sustainability could fall under ethics in tech.
8. **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**: Directly mentioned as the target of their approach.
9. **Human-Computer Interaction**: Focuses on how users interact with recommendation systems.
10. **Impact Analysis**: They analyze the impact of their explanations on user acceptance.

I should ensure these categories are clear and relevant. Each category should be distinct but overlapping where necessary to enhance discoverability. I also need to make sure not to create too narrow or too broad categories, balancing distribution as per guidelines.
&lt;/think&gt;
