        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Modeling Two-Way Selection Preference for Person-Job Fit
Abstract:
Person-job fit is the core technique of online recruitment platforms, which can improve the efficiency of recruitment by accurately matching the job positions with the job seekers. Existing works mainly focus on modeling the unidirectional process or overall matching. However, recruitment is a two-way selection process, which means that both candidate and employer involved in the interaction should meet the expectation of each other, instead of unilateral satisfaction. In this paper, we propose a dual-perspective graph representation learning approach to model directed interactions between candidates and jobs. To model the two-way selection preference from the dual-perspective of job seekers and employers, we incorporate two different nodes for each candidate (or job) and characterize both successful matching and failed matching via a unified dual-perspective interaction graph. To learn dual-perspective node representations effectively, we design an effective optimization algorithm, which involves a quadruple-based loss and a dual-perspective contrastive learning loss. Extensive experiments on three large real-world recruitment datasets have shown the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/DPGNN .

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Modeling Two-Way Selection Preference for Person-Job Fit.&#34; That immediately tells me it&#39;s about matching people with jobs, which falls under recommendation systems but in the context of recruitment. So I&#39;ll note that as a primary category.

Looking at the abstract, the article discusses person-job fit, which is crucial for online recruitment platforms. They mention existing works focus on unidirectional processes or overall matching. The authors propose a dual-perspective graph representation learning approach to model directed interactions between candidates and jobs. This indicates they&#39;re using graph-based methods, which is another category.

They incorporate two different nodes for each candidate or job and use a unified dual-perspective interaction graph. So this involves graph theory in their methodology.

The approach uses an optimization algorithm with quadruple-based loss and dual-perspective contrastive learning loss. That points towards loss functions as a category since they&#39;re discussing the specific techniques used in training their model.

The experiments are conducted on three large real-world recruitment datasets, showing effectiveness. This means the article has real-world applications, so that&#39;s another category.

They also mention extensive experiments, which relates to evaluation methods because they&#39;re assessing their approach&#39;s performance.

Since the focus is on two-way selection preferences, it&#39;s not just a one-sided recommendation but mutual matching. So mutual recommendation makes sense as a category here.

The dual-perspective aspect suggests a multi-view learning approach, where different perspectives are considered for each entity involved (candidates and jobs). That adds another layer to their methodology.

Additionally, since the study is about improving recruitment efficiency by accurately matching both sides, it&#39;s an application of recommendation systems in the domain of recruitment. So that&#39;s another category.

They also discuss directed interactions, which might be a specific aspect of how they model the relationships between candidates and jobs. But I&#39;m not sure if &#34;Directed Interactions&#34; is a common enough category to include; perhaps it&#39;s too niche.

Considering all these points, I should assign categories that cover both the methodology (graph-based methods, loss functions, multi-view learning), the application (recommendation systems in recruitment), the evaluation aspect, real-world applications, and specific techniques like dual-perspective modeling.

I think the main categories here are Graph-Based Methods, Recommendation Systems, Recruitment, Real-World Applications, Evaluation Methods, Mutual Recommendations, Loss Functions, Dual-Perspective Modeling, Multi-View Learning. I might also consider aspects like Two-Way Selection or Interaction Modeling if those are standard categories, but given the guidelines, I should stick to more established terms.
&lt;/think&gt;

Graph-Based Methods, Recommendation Systems, Recruitment, Real-World Applications, Evaluation Methods, Mutual Recommendations, Loss Functions, Dual-Perspective Modeling, Multi-View Learning.</code></pre>
