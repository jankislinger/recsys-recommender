Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.

Title: Exploring the longitudinal effect of nudging on users’ genre exploration behavior and listening preference
Abstract:
Previous studies on exploration have shown that users can be nudged to explore further away from their current preferences. However, these effects were shown in a single session study, while it often takes time to explore new tastes and develop new preferences. In this work, we present a longitudinal study on users’ exploration behavior and behavior change over time after they have used a music genre exploration tool for four sessions in six weeks. We test two relevant nudges to help them explore more: the starting point (the personalization of the default initial playlist) and the visualization of users’ previous position(s). Our results show that the personalization level of the default initial playlist in the first session influences the preferred personalization level users set in the second session but fades away in later sessions as users start exploring in different directions. Visualization of users’ previous positions did not anchor users to stay closer to the initial defaults. Over time, users perceived the playlist to be more personalized to their tastes and helpful to explore the genre. Perceived helpfulness increased more when users explored further away from their current preferences. Apart from differences in self-reported measures, we also find some objective evidence for preference change in users’ top tracks from their Spotify profile, that over the period of 6 weeks moved somewhat closer to the genre that users selected to explore with the tool.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about nudging and user exploration behavior. Let&#39;s start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Exploring the longitudinal effect of nudging on users’ genre exploration behavior and listening preference.&#34; Hmm, that tells me it&#39;s looking at how nudges affect users over time in terms of exploring music genres and their preferences. 

Looking at the abstract: They mention a longitudinal study over four sessions in six weeks. So this isn&#39;t just a quick experiment; they&#39;re tracking changes over time. The focus is on two nudges: starting point personalization and visualization of previous positions. Interesting, so it&#39;s about how these interventions influence user behavior.

The results show that the initial playlist&#39;s personalization affects users&#39; settings in the next session but fades later as they explore more. Visualization didn&#39;t keep them anchored to defaults. Over time, users felt the playlists were more personalized and helpful when exploring further from their preferences. There was also some objective evidence of preference change through Spotify data.

Now, I need to assign categories based on this content. Let me go through the guidelines and examples provided.

First, think about family of algorithms or methods. They used nudges, which might be considered as part of behavioral interventions or recommendation strategies. So maybe &#34;Behavioral Interventions&#34; could be a category.

The domain here is music, so &#34;Music&#34; would definitely be relevant. Also, since it&#39;s about user exploration and preferences, &#34;User Behavior&#34; seems appropriate. The study looks at how users&#39; preferences change over time, which ties into &#34;Preference Evolution.&#34;

They&#39;re using a recommendation tool to explore genres, so that falls under &#34;Recommendation Systems.&#34; The nudges are designed to encourage exploration, specifically in the context of genre exploration, so adding &#34;Genre Exploration&#34; makes sense.

The article discusses longitudinal effects, meaning it&#39;s tracking changes over an extended period. So categories like &#34;Longitudinal Study&#34; and &#34;User Preferences Over Time&#34; would capture that aspect.

They mention A/B testing with different nudges, which is a method used in experiments. So including &#34;A/B Testing&#34; as a category fits here. The study also evaluates the impact on users&#39; behavior through both self-reported measures and objective data from Spotify, so &#34;Evaluation Methods&#34; is another relevant category.

The visualization of previous positions is one of the nudges tested. This could fall under &#34;Interface Design,&#34; as it&#39;s about how the tool&#39;s interface influences user interaction. Additionally, since they&#39;re exploring beyond just initial preferences, &#34;Exploration Beyond Preferences&#34; would be a good specific recommendation category.

Putting it all together, I think these categories cover the main aspects of the study: the methods used (behavioral interventions, A/B testing), the domain (music), the focus on user behavior and preferences, the longitudinal nature of the research, and the evaluation techniques employed.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task step by step. I need to assign the given research article to multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract.

First, I&#39;ll read through the title and abstract carefully. The title mentions &#34;longitudinal effect of nudging&#34; and focuses on users&#39; genre exploration behavior and listening preferences in music. So it&#39;s about how nudges influence users over time regarding their musical tastes.

The abstract explains that this is a longitudinal study (six weeks) testing two nudges: starting point personalization and visualization of previous positions. The results show that initial personalization affects the next session but fades, while visualization doesn&#39;t anchor users. Users perceive playlists as more personalized and helpful when exploring genres further from their preferences. There&#39;s also evidence of preference change in Spotify data.

Now, considering the categories I need to assign:

1. **Nudging**: Directly mentioned in the title and discussed throughout the study.
2. **Exploration (User Behavior)**: The study is about how users explore new genres, which falls under this category.
3. **Personalization**: The article discusses personalizing playlists and default initial settings, so this is relevant.
4. **Longitudinal Study**: It&#39;s a six-week study tracking behavior over time, fitting here.
5. **MusicRecommendations**: Since the context is music genre exploration, this category applies.
6. **Behavior Change**: The study examines how nudges lead to changes in user behavior and preferences.
7. **Visualization**: One of the tested nudges involves visualizing previous positions, so this is included.
8. **User Preferences**: The article discusses how users&#39; preferences evolve over time.
9. **Genre Exploration**: Specifically focuses on exploring different music genres.

I should ensure each category is distinct and relevant without overlap. I think these nine categories cover all aspects mentioned in the abstract and title effectively. They are specific enough to be useful but broad enough to allow for a balanced distribution of articles.

Double-checking, none of the categories seem redundant or too narrow. Each captures a key aspect of the study&#39;s focus on nudging, exploration, personalization, and long-term behavior change in music preferences.
&lt;/think&gt;
