Title: Context-Aware Event Recommendation in Event-based Social Networks
Abstract:
The Web has grown into one of the most important channels to communicate social events nowadays. However, the sheer volume of events available in event-based social networks (EBSNs) often undermines the users’ ability to choose the events that best fit their interests. Recommender systems appear as a natural solution for this problem, but differently from classic recommendation scenarios (e.g. movies, books), the event recommendation problem is intrinsically cold-start. Indeed, events published in EBSNs are typically short-lived and, by definition, are always in the future, having little or no trace of historical attendance. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit several contextual signals available from EBSNs. In particular, besides content-based signals based on the events’ description and collaborative signals derived from users’ RSVPs, we exploit social signals based on group memberships, location signals based on the users’ geographical preferences, and temporal signals derived from the users’ time preferences. Moreover, we combine the proposed signals for learning to rank events for personalized recommendation. Thorough experiments using a large crawl of Meetup.com demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed contextual learning approach in contrast to state-of-the-art event recommenders from the literature.

Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about Context-Aware Event Recommendation in EBSNs. Let me go through it step by step.

First, looking at the title: it&#39;s about event recommendations in social networks that are event-based, like Meetup. So right away, I know it&#39;s related to recommendation systems but specifically for events. That makes me think categories like &#34;Event Recommendation&#34; and maybe &#34;Social Networks&#34; would fit here.

The abstract mentions that they&#39;re dealing with a cold-start problem, which is common in recommendation systems where new items have little historical data. Since events are short-lived and future-oriented, this fits the cold-start scenario perfectly. So &#34;Cold Start&#34; should definitely be one of the categories.

They talk about using various contextual signals: content-based (like event descriptions), collaborative (from RSVPs), social signals (group memberships), location signals (geographical preferences), and temporal signals (time preferences). Each of these is a specific aspect they&#39;re addressing, so I should include each as a separate category. That gives me &#34;Content-Based Signals,&#34; &#34;Collaborative Filtering,&#34; &#34;Social Signals,&#34; &#34;Location-Based Recommendations,&#34; and &#34;Temporal Signals.&#34;

The article also discusses how they combine these signals using learning to rank for personalized recommendations. So &#34;Learning to Rank&#34; is another key category here.

They evaluated their approach against state-of-the-art methods, so &#34;Evaluation of Recommendation Systems&#34; is relevant. Additionally, the fact that they used a large dataset from Meetup.com suggests real-world application, which ties into &#34;Real-World Applications.&#34;

Putting this all together, I need to make sure each category is clear and user-friendly. The categories should cover both specific aspects like the types of signals used and broader topics like recommendation systems in general. Also, ensuring that there are enough categories without overcrowding any single one.

I think these categories capture the essence of the article and align well with what users might be interested in when exploring similar research.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Context-Aware Event Recommendation in Event-based Social Networks.&#34; The user provided the title and abstract, so I&#39;ll start by reading through that carefully.

The abstract mentions that the Web is a key channel for social events, but EBSNs have too many events, making it hard for users to find what they like. Recommender systems are proposed as a solution, but unlike movies or books, event recommendations are cold-start because events are short-lived and future-oriented with little historical data.

They propose using various contextual signals: content-based (event descriptions), collaborative (users&#39; RSVPs), social (group memberships), location-based (geographical preferences), and temporal (time preferences). They combine these signals to learn how to rank events for personalized recommendations. Experiments on Meetup.com show their approach is effective.

Now, I need to assign this article to multiple categories based on the guidelines provided. The categories should be relevant, user-friendly, and ensure each gets enough articles without overcrowding.

Starting with the family of algorithms: They mention a learning-to-rank approach, which falls under Machine Learning and Collaborative Filtering. So that&#39;s two categories.

Domain-wise, it&#39;s clearly about Events and Social Networks, so those are essential.

Looking at specific recommendation aspects, Cold Start is a big one because they address this challenge. Context-Aware Recommendation is another since they use various contextual signals.

Evaluation aspects: They talk about effectiveness through experiments, which relates to Evaluation Metrics and Effectiveness. Also, since they compare with state-of-the-art methods, that&#39;s Performance Comparison.

Real-world applications are mentioned with Meetup.com, so Real-World Applications and A/B Testing (though the abstract doesn&#39;t explicitly mention A/B testing, but it&#39;s a common real-world evaluation method).

Other relevant categories include Personalization because it&#39;s about personalized recommendations. Scalability might be implied since they handle large datasets, as seen in their experiments using a large crawl.

Putting it all together, I think these categories cover the necessary aspects without being too specific or too broad. They should help users navigate and discover content effectively.
&lt;/think&gt;
