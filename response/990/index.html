Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.

Title: Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit for Email Layout Recommendation
Abstract:
We present the use of a contextual multi-armed bandit approach to improve the personalization of marketing emails sent to Wayfair’s customers. Emails are a critical outreach tool as they economically unlock a significant amount of revenue. We describe how we formulated our problem of selecting the optimal personalized email layout to use as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem. We also explain how we approximated a solution with an Epsilon-greedy strategy. We detail the thorough evaluations we ran, including offline experiments, an off-policy evaluation, and an online A/B test. Our results demonstrate that our approach is able to select personalized email layouts that lead to significant gains in topline business metrics including engagement and conversion rates.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on the guidelines provided. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit for Email Layout Recommendation.&#34; That immediately tells me it&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically using a multi-armed bandit approach in a contextual setting. The application here is email layouts for marketing purposes at Wayfair.

Looking at the abstract, they mention improving personalization of marketing emails, which ties into customer engagement and conversion rates. They describe their problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem, so that&#39;s another key point. They used an Epsilon-greedy strategy to approximate a solution. Evaluation methods included offline experiments, off-policy evaluation, and online A/B testing. The results showed significant gains in business metrics like engagement and conversion.

Now, I need to map this into categories based on the examples provided: family of algorithm, domain of problem, specific recommendation aspects, evaluation aspects, real-world applications, etc.

First, the algorithm used is a contextual multi-armed bandit, so that&#39;s one category. The application is email layouts in marketing, which falls under Marketing and maybe Email as a more specific domain. Since it&#39;s about recommendations, the broader category of Recommendation Systems applies.

The problem involves personalization, so Personalization is another relevant category. They used real-world applications like A/B testing and user surveys (though the abstract mentions A/AB tests but not user surveys specifically). However, since they did an online A/B test, that&#39;s a real-world application point.

Looking at evaluation aspects, they performed offline experiments, off-policy evaluation, and online A/B testing. So Evaluation Methods is a category. Also, because they&#39;re looking beyond just accuracy metrics like engagement and conversion rates, Beyond Accuracy makes sense here.

Additionally, since the context involves customer interactions with emails, that&#39;s about user behavior. The system was implemented in a production environment (Wayfair), so Production Systems could be another category.

So compiling all these points: Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits as the algorithm, Marketing and Email as domains, Recommendation Systems and Personalization for specific recommendation aspects, Evaluation Methods, Beyond Accuracy for evaluation metrics, A/B Test for real-world application, User Behavior, and Production Systems where it was applied.

I should ensure I&#39;m covering at least 8-12 categories. Let me count: Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits (1), Marketing (2), Email (3), Recommendation Systems (4), Personalization (5), Evaluation Methods (6), Beyond Accuracy (7), A/B Test (8), User Behavior (9), Production Systems (10). That&#39;s 10 categories, which fits within the guidelines.

I should also make sure that these categories are clear and user-friendly. For example, &#34;Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits&#34; is specific but accurate. &#34;Email&#34; might be too broad, but given the domain is marketing emails, it makes sense. Alternatively, if there&#39;s a more specific category like Email Marketing, that could work too, but based on the examples provided, I think &#34;Email&#34; is acceptable.

I don&#39;t see any need to create overly specific categories beyond what&#39;s listed because each should be broad enough for discoverability without being too niche. Also, maintaining consistency across categorizations ensures a cohesive user experience.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit for Email Layout Recommendation.&#34; Let&#39;s start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The article uses a contextual multi-armed bandit approach for email layout recommendations. That immediately makes me think of the algorithm family involved here—multi-armed bandits. So that should be one category. 

Next, the application domain is marketing emails, specifically for Wayfair. This falls under E-commerce since it&#39;s about improving customer outreach and revenue through personalized emails. I&#39;ll add E-commerce as a category.

Looking at the problem formulation, they mention personalization of email layouts. Personalization in recommendation systems is a key aspect, so that&#39;s another relevant category.

The approach involves using an epsilon-greedy strategy to approximate the solution. This ties into the bandit algorithm family and also touches on exploration vs exploitation strategies. So both Epsilon-Greedy and Exploration/Exploitation are categories to include.

The evaluation methods mentioned include offline experiments, off-policy evaluations, and online A/B testing. Real-world application aspects like A/B Testing should be another category, as it shows the practical implementation of their approach.

Additionally, since the article focuses on improving business metrics such as engagement and conversion rates through personalization, Business Impact is a fitting category. 

I should make sure I cover all relevant areas without overcomplicating. Let me list them out: Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit, E-commerce, Personalization, Epsilon-Greedy, Exploration/Exploitation, A/B Testing, and Business Impact.

Wait, do I need to add any more categories? The problem is applied in a real-world setting with specific metrics, so maybe &#34;Real-World Application&#34; could be another category. Hmm, but since it&#39;s already covered under A/B Testing and Business Impact, perhaps it&#39;s redundant. No, I think the current list covers all necessary aspects without overlap.
&lt;/think&gt;

Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit, E-commerce, Personalization, Epsilon-Greedy, Exploration/Exploitation, A/B Test, Business Impact</code></pre>
