        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Counterfactual learning for recommender system
Abstract:
Most commercial industrial recommender systems have built their closed feedback loops. Though it is helpful in item recommendation and model training, the closed feedback loop may lead to the so-called bias problems, including the position bias, selection bias and popularity bias. The recommendation models trained with biased may hurt the user experiences by recommending homogenous items. How to control the biases in the closed feedback loop has become one of major challenges in modern recommender systems. This talk discusses the counterfactual learning technologies for tackling the bias problem in recommendation.
The talk consists of four parts.
The first part, briefly introduces the counterfactual learning with two cases from the academic perspective [4, 5].
The second part illustrates the position bias and selection bias based on two real examples. These examples inspire us to study “How to use counterfactual technology for recommender system?” from the industry perspective.
In the third part, we firstly encourage the audiences to think an important question: “What kind of data can learn an unbiased model?” After that, we propose four counterfactual learning approaches and related studies, as shown in Figure1.
Approach 1: Learn from counterfactual data. We need to learn full-information model with partial observed information data. The full-information model is an unbiased model, which is trained by both observed data and unobserved data (including counterfactual data), but how to model unobserved data? One common approach is direct method [2]. In this talk, we introduce a novel counterfactual learning framework [8], first, an imputation model can by learned by a small amount of unbiased uniform data, then the imputation model can be used to predict labels of all counterfactual samples, finally, we train a counterfactual recommendation model with both observed and counterfactual samples.
Approach 2: Correct biased observed data. Inverse propensity score (IPS) is a widely studied method and relatively easy to be deployed for real products. IPS is defined as the conditional probability of receiving the treatment given pre-treatment covariates by Rosenbaum and Rubin [7]. But IPS method should satisfy two assumptions: (1) overlap, and (2) unconfoundedness. Inspired by the sample reweighting work for robust deep learning [6], we proposed a novel influence function based method to reweight training samples directly.
Approach 3: Doubly robust method. The doubly robust methods [7] have two parts: IPS method part and direct method part. John Langford etc. prove that either one part of them can debias, the doubly robust method can debias. But both of the propensity and imputation model are not easy to learn, so we present a novel propensity free doubly robust method [8] for click-through-rate (CTR) prediction task. In order to solve the efficiency of full samples (including both unobserved and observed sample) learning problem, we proposed block coordinate descend and conjugate gradient method, which can reduce the time complexity of optimization from O(m*n) to O(m+n).
Approach 4: Joint learning unbiased data and biased data. In recommender system, unbiased data is collected through randomly recommendation approach. The unbiased data is less, and its collection process is expensive. Through online A/B testing, the performance of the model trained with biased data and unbiased data together is superior to the performance of the model trained with only biased data. Causal embedding [1] method is another method to learn both biased data and unbiased data for improving the accuracy of prediction model. We also propose a general knowledge distillation framework for counterfactual recommendation via uniform data [3], which propose a general framework about how to use unbiased data with four distillation methods: label distillation, sample distillation, feature distillation and model structure distillation.
We also summarize the advantages and challenges of the above approaches.
The last part emphasizes that counterfactual learning is a rich research area, and discuss several important research topics, such as optimization for counterfactual learning, counterfactual meta learning, stable learning, fairness, unbiased learning to rank, offline policy evaluation.

Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this article about Counterfactual Learning in Recommender Systems. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, looking at the title: it mentions &#34;Counterfactual Learning for Recommender System.&#34; So that&#39;s a specific technique within recommendation systems. I should note that as a category.

The abstract talks about bias problems in recommender systems, like position bias, selection bias, and popularity bias. These are specific issues within recommendation systems, so each of these could be their own categories.

It also mentions the closed feedback loop leading to biased models, which affects user experience by recommending homogeneous items. This relates to model training and user experience. So maybe &#34;Model Training&#34; and &#34;User Experience&#34; as categories.

The article discusses four approaches: learning from counterfactual data, correcting biased observed data using IPS, doubly robust methods, and joint learning of unbiased and biased data. These are all specific techniques or methods used in recommendation systems. I&#39;ll add each approach as a category.

It also talks about real-world applications like A/B testing and user surveys, so &#34;A/B Test&#34; should be included. The evaluation aspects mentioned include diversity and beyond accuracy metrics, which ties into how the recommendations are assessed. So &#34;Diversity of Recommendations&#34; and &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; would fit here.

The abstract mentions both academic and industry perspectives, so adding &#34;Academic Perspective&#34; and &#34;Industry Perspective&#34; makes sense.

Looking at specific algorithms or methods discussed, like inverse propensity score (IPS), influence function-based methods, causal embedding, and knowledge distillation. Each of these could be their own categories since they are distinct techniques within the broader counterfactual learning framework.

The article also touches on challenges in optimization for counterfactual learning, which relates to algorithm scalability. So &#34;Algorithm Scalability&#34; is another category.

Finally, it discusses topics like offline policy evaluation and fairness, which tie into more general aspects of recommendation systems and machine learning ethics. These can be broader categories as well.

Putting this all together, I need to ensure that each article is placed in at least 8-12 relevant categories without overcrowding any single category. The goal is to make the interface user-friendly and intuitive for those exploring these articles.
&lt;/think&gt;
