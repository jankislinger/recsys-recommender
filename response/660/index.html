Title: Semi-Supervised Visual Representation Learning for Fashion Compatibility
Abstract:
We consider the problem of complementary fashion prediction. Existing approaches focus on learning an embedding space where fashion items from different categories that are visually compatible are closer to each other. However, creating such labeled outfits is intensive and also not feasible to generate all possible outfit combinations, especially with large fashion catalogs. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach where we leverage large unlabeled fashion corpus to create pseudo positive and negative outfits on the fly during training. For each labeled outfit in a training batch, we obtain a pseudo-outfit by matching each item in the labeled outfit with unlabeled items. Additionally, we introduce consistency regularization to ensure that representation of the original images and their transformations are consistent to implicitly incorporate colour and other important attributes through self-supervision. We conduct extensive experiments on Polyvore, Polyvore-D and our newly created large-scale Fashion Outfits datasets, and show that our approach with only a fraction of labeled examples performs on-par with completely supervised methods.

Alright, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Semi-Supervised Visual Representation Learning for Fashion Compatibility.&#34; Hmm, that suggests it&#39;s about using machine learning techniques, specifically semi-supervised methods, in the fashion domain. The focus seems to be on how different fashion items can be compatible with each other visually.

Looking at the abstract: They mention complementary fashion prediction and creating an embedding space where compatible items are closer together. Existing approaches rely on labeled outfits, but that&#39;s intensive and not scalable because there are too many possible combinations. So their solution is a semi-supervised approach using unlabeled data to create pseudo-outfits during training.

They also talk about consistency regularization for image representations, which helps incorporate color and other attributes through self-supervision. The experiments were conducted on Polyvore datasets and a new large-scale dataset they created. Results show that with less labeled data, their method performs as well as fully supervised methods.

Now, thinking about the categories. The main areas here are machine learning techniques like semi-supervised learning and visual representation learning. Since it&#39;s about fashion compatibility, the domain is definitely fashion and style. They use datasets for evaluation, so dataset creation and evaluation metrics would be relevant.

The approach includes self-supervision through consistency regularization, which ties into unsupervised learning methods as well. There are real-world applications since they&#39;re dealing with outfit combinations, which can apply to e-commerce or personal styling tools.

They also discuss scalability because their method works with a fraction of labeled data, making it more practical for large datasets. The experiments involve transfer learning and image processing, so those categories make sense too.

I should also consider specific recommendation aspects like item compatibility and visual similarity since that&#39;s the core of the problem they&#39;re addressing. Their work impacts how recommendations are generated in fashion, so recommendation systems is another key category.

Putting it all together, I need to list at least 8-12 relevant categories. Let me make sure each captures an important aspect without being too niche or overlapping too much.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Semi-Supervised Visual Representation Learning for Fashion Compatibility.&#34; Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.

The paper discusses complementary fashion prediction. The main goal is to create an embedding space where compatible fashion items are close together. They mention that existing methods require labeled outfits, which can be intensive and not feasible due to the large number of possible combinations.

So, they propose a semi-supervised approach. Instead of relying solely on labeled data, they use a large unlabeled corpus to generate pseudo-outfits during training. For each labeled outfit, they match items with unlabeled ones to create these pseudo examples. They also introduce consistency regularization to ensure that image representations are consistent even when transformed, incorporating attributes like color through self-supervision.

They test their method on existing datasets (Polyvore, Polyvore-D) and a new large-scale dataset they created. The results show that their semi-supervised approach performs similarly to fully supervised methods but with much less labeled data.

Now, I&#39;ll map this content to relevant categories based on the guidelines provided.

1. **Family of Algorithm**: Since they&#39;re using semi-supervised learning techniques, including self-supervision (consistency regularization), and leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, this falls under Semi-Supervised Learning. They might also be using deep learning models for representation learning, so Deep Learning is another category.

2. **Domain of the Problem**: The application is clearly in Fashion recommendation, specifically dealing with compatibility between items. So, Fashion is a primary domain here.

3. **Specific Aspect in Recommendation Space**: The paper focuses on complementary fashion prediction, which is a specific aspect within the broader recommendation space. Therefore, Complementary Recommendations fits as a category.

4. **Evaluation Aspects**: They mention evaluating their method using standard benchmarks (Polyvore datasets) and a new large-scale dataset they created. Additionally, since their approach deals with multiple items in an outfit, it touches on aspects like Diversity of Recommendations because compatibility implies diverse item combinations.

5. **Real-World Applications**: The paper highlights the practical aspect of reducing reliance on labeled data, which makes it scalable for real-world fashion recommendation systems. Thus, Scalability is a relevant category.

6. **Other Relevant Categories**: Since they&#39;re dealing with visual representations and using images, Computer Vision is another key area. Also, their approach involves creating pseudo-labels from unlabeled data, which relates to Self-Supervised Learning techniques.

Putting it all together, the categories should reflect both the methodological aspects (semi-supervised, deep learning), application domain (fashion), specific recommendation focus (complementary), evaluation metrics (diversity), scalability, and other relevant technical areas like computer vision and self-supervision.
