        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: A Multi-Stakeholder Recommender System for Rewards Recommendations
Abstract:
Australiaâ€™s largest bank, Commonwealth Bank (CBA) has a large data and analytics function that focuses on building a brighter future for all using data and decision science. In this work, we focus on creating better services for CBA customers by developing a next generation recommender system that brings the most relevant merchant reward offers that can help customers save money. Our recommender provides CBA cardholders with cashback offers from merchants, who have different objectives when they create offers. This work describes a multi-stakeholder, multi-objective problem in the context of CommBank Rewards (CBR) and describes how we developed a system that balances the objectives of the bank, its customers, and the many objectives from merchants into a single recommender system.

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about a multi-stakeholder recommender system for rewards recommendations. Let&#39;s see... The title mentions it&#39;s for a bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which is their largest. So the domain here is clearly banking and finance because it&#39;s about customer rewards in that context.

The abstract talks about a next-gen recommender system that provides cashback offers from merchants. So this involves recommendation systems specifically tailored for financial services or banks. That makes me think of categories like Banking &amp; Finance and Financial Services.

They mention that the system balances objectives between the bank, customers, and merchants. That&#39;s a multi-stakeholder approach, so I should include Multi-Stakeholder Systems. Also, since it&#39;s balancing multiple goals (saving money for customers, merchant objectives), it&#39;s a multi-objective optimization problem. So Multi-Objective Optimization is another category.

The recommender system part is pretty clear, but they also mention real-world applications because they&#39;re implementing this at CBA with A/B testing and user surveys to evaluate effectiveness. That points towards Real-World Applications, A/B Testing, and User Surveys as evaluation methods.

Looking at aspects of evaluation beyond just accuracy, the article focuses on how effective the recommendations are in saving money and whether users find them useful. So Beyond Accuracy makes sense because they&#39;re considering other metrics besides traditional recommendation performance measures.

The system uses data analytics to create these services, so Data Analytics is relevant. It&#39;s a case study within the financial sector, so Case Study could be another category. 

I should also consider if there are any specific algorithms mentioned, but the abstract doesn&#39;t go into that detail, so I won&#39;t include algorithm-specific categories unless it&#39;s clearly stated.

Putting it all together, the main areas are recommendation systems in banking, handling multiple stakeholders and objectives, real-world implementation with testing methods, evaluation beyond accuracy, and using data analytics in a case study context.
&lt;/think&gt;

Banking &amp; Finance, Financial Services, Recommendation Systems, Multi-Stakeholder Systems, Real-World Applications, A/B Testing, User Surveys, Case Study, Data Analytics, Multi-Objective Optimization, Beyond Accuracy</code></pre>
