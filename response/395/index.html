Title: EXTRA: Explaining Team Recommendation in Networks
Abstract:
State-of-the-art in network science of teams offers effective recommendation methods to answer questions like who is the best replacement, what is the best team expansion strategy, but lacks intuitive ways to explain why the optimization algorithm gives the specific recommendation for a given team optimization scenario. To tackle this problem, we develop an interactive prototype system, Extra, as the first step towards addressing such a sense-making challenge, through the lens of the underlying network where teams embed, to explain the team recommendation results. The main advantages are (1) Algorithm efficacy: we propose an effective and fast algorithm to explain random walk graph kernel, the central technique for networked team recommendation; (2) Intuitive visual explanation: we present intuitive visual analysis of the recommendation results, which can help users better understand the rationality of the underlying team recommendation algorithm.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article about explaining team recommendations in networks. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;EXTRA: Explaining Team Recommendation in Networks.&#34; The abstract talks about how current network science methods are good at recommending team replacements or expansions but lack ways to explain why these recommendations happen. They developed a system called Extra to help users understand these recommendations better through visual analysis and an efficient algorithm.

So, the main themes here seem to be team recommendation, explanation mechanisms, and visualization. It&#39;s about making sure that when teams are recommended changes, there&#39;s a clear way for people to see why those suggestions were made. That involves both explaining the algorithms (maybe using something like graph kernels) and presenting this information visually.

Looking at the categories provided earlier, I think &#34;Team Recommendation&#34; is directly mentioned in the title. Since they&#39;re working on explaining these recommendations, &#34;Recommendation Explanation&#34; would be another key category. They also focus on visual explanations, so &#34;Visualization&#34; makes sense.

The system they built, Extra, involves an algorithm that explains a random walk graph kernel. So, &#34;Algorithmic Transparency&#34; is important here because it&#39;s about making the algorithm&#39;s decisions clear. Also, their work ties into network analysis since teams are embedded in networks, so &#34;Network Analysis&#34; should be included.

I notice they mention optimization algorithms and how Extra helps explain why certain optimizations were chosen. So, &#34;Optimization Algorithms&#34; could be another category. The system itself is a tool for sense-making, so perhaps &#34;Sense-Making Tools.&#34; They might also be dealing with how users interact with these recommendations, which ties into &#34;User Interaction.&#34;

Thinking about broader categories, this falls under the umbrella of recommendation systems in general and human-computer interaction since it&#39;s about making algorithms understandable to users. So, adding &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; and &#34;Human-Computer Interaction&#34; would be beneficial.

I should also consider if there are any domain-specific terms here. It doesn&#39;t seem tied to a specific industry like healthcare or education but is more about the methods themselves. However, since they mention teams in networks, maybe &#34;Collaborative Systems&#34; could fit, as it deals with how people work together.

So, putting it all together: Team Recommendation, Recommendation Explanation, Visualization, Algorithmic Transparency, Network Analysis, Optimization Algorithms, Sense-Making Tools, User Interaction, Human-Computer Interaction, Collaborative Systems. That gives me 10 categories, which fits the requirement of 8-12.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I&#39;m looking at this article titled &#34;EXTRA: Explaining Team Recommendation in Networks.&#34; The abstract mentions that it addresses the lack of intuitive explanations for why certain team recommendations are made by algorithms. They developed a system called Extra to help explain these recommendations through network visualization.

First, the key themes here seem to be around recommendation systems and network science. Since they&#39;re talking about teams, this likely falls under the &#34;Teams&#34; category in terms of domain. The focus is on explaining how team recommendations work, so that relates to explanation methods or interpretability in machine learning.

They mention using an interactive prototype system, which suggests that user interaction and visualizations are important aspects. So categories like Visual Explanation, Interactive Systems, and maybe User Experience would be relevant here.

The article also talks about the algorithm&#39;s efficacy and speed, specifically mentioning random walk graph kernels. That points to specific algorithms or techniques in network science, so Algorithm Efficacy and Random Walk Graph Kernel should be included.

Since it&#39;s about explaining recommendations, it ties into general recommendation systems. Additionally, the interactive system they developed could relate to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) because it involves user interaction for better understanding.

Putting this all together, I think the categories would cover both the technical aspects (like algorithms and specific kernels) and the more applied areas like visualization and HCI. It&#39;s also about explaining complex systems to users, so Explanation Methods in ML is another fit.
&lt;/think&gt;
