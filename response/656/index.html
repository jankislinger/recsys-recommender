        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Recommendation on Live-Streaming Platforms: Dynamic Availability and Repeat Consumption
Abstract:
Live-streaming platforms broadcast user-generated video in real-time. Recommendation on these platforms shares similarities with traditional settings, such as a large volume of heterogeneous content and highly skewed interaction distributions. However, several challenges must be overcome to adapt recommendation algorithms to live-streaming platforms: first, content availability is dynamic which restricts users to choose from only a subset of items at any given time; during training and inference we must carefully handle this factor in order to properly account for such signals, where ‘non-interactions’ reflect availability as much as implicit preference. Streamers are also fundamentally different from ‘items’ in traditional settings: repeat consumption of specific channels plays a significant role, though the content itself is fundamentally ephemeral. In this work, we study recommendation in this setting of a dynamically evolving set of available items. We propose LiveRec, a self-attentive model that personalizes item ranking based on both historical interactions and current availability. We also show that carefully modelling repeat consumption plays a significant role in model performance. To validate our approach, and to inspire further research on this setting, we release a dataset containing 475M user interactions on Twitch over a 43-day period. We evaluate our approach on a recommendation task and show our method to outperform various strong baselines in ranking the currently available content.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about recommendations on live-streaming platforms. The title mentions &#34;Recommendation on Live-Streaming Platforms: Dynamic Availability and Repeat Consumption.&#34; So, first off, it&#39;s definitely related to recommendation systems.

The abstract talks about the challenges of dynamic availability—content that&#39;s only available for a short time. This is different from traditional recommendations where items are static. So I should include categories like &#34;Dynamic Availability&#34; and maybe &#34;Live Streaming.&#34;

It also mentions repeat consumption, which is about users revisiting specific channels or content multiple times. That makes me think of &#34;Repeat Consumption.&#34; The model they propose, LiveRec, uses self-attention, so &#34;Self-Attention Models&#34; is another category.

The dataset they used has 475M interactions on Twitch over 43 days. That&#39;s a real-world application, so I should add categories like &#34;Real World Application,&#34; &#34;User Interaction Data,&#34; and maybe &#34;Streaming Platforms.&#34;

They evaluated their approach against strong baselines, which falls under &#34;Model Evaluation.&#34; The focus is on ranking available content, so &#34;Ranking Algorithms&#34; makes sense.

The content being ephemeral—meaning it&#39;s only available for a short time—is another key point, so &#34;Ephemeral Content&#34; should be included. Since Twitch is mentioned, &#34;Twitch&#34; as a specific platform category would help users interested in that context.

The problem domain here is live-streaming platforms, so categories like &#34;Live-Streaming Platforms,&#34; &#34;Real-Time Systems,&#34; and perhaps &#34;Video Streaming&#34; are relevant.

They discuss how non-interactions can be due to availability rather than preference, which ties into handling such signals. So maybe &#34;Signal Processing&#34; or something related could fit, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the best fit here.

Also, considering aspects of evaluation beyond accuracy, like diversity and personalization, might be another angle, but the abstract doesn&#39;t delve deeply into that. Maybe focusing more on what they actually measured is better.

I need to make sure each category is clear and user-friendly. Also, avoiding too many similar categories. For example, &#34;Live Streaming&#34; and &#34;Video Streaming&#34; are quite close, so perhaps choosing one or being specific with Twitch might be better.

Overall, the main areas are recommendation systems, live-streaming dynamics, model specifics, real-world application, evaluation, and dataset aspects. I should aim for about 8-12 categories that cover these points without overlap.
&lt;/think&gt;
