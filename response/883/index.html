        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Reciprocal Sequential Recommendation
Abstract:
Reciprocal recommender system (RRS), considering a two-way matching between two parties, has been widely applied in online platforms like online dating and recruitment. Existing RRS models mainly capture static user preferences, which have neglected the evolving user tastes and the dynamic matching relation between the two parties. Although dynamic user modeling has been well-studied in sequential recommender systems, existing solutions are developed in a user-oriented manner. Therefore, it is non-trivial to adapt sequential recommendation algorithms to reciprocal recommendation. In this paper, we formulate RRS as a distinctive sequence matching task, and further propose a new approach ReSeq for RRS, which is short for Reciprocal Sequential recommendation. To capture duel-perspective matching, we propose to learn fine-grained sequence similarities by co-attention mechanism across different time steps. Further, to improve the inference efficiency, we introduce the self-distillation technique to distill knowledge from the fine-grained matching module into the more efficient student module. In the deployment stage, only the efficient student module is used, greatly speeding up the similarity computation. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets from two scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task step by step. The article in question is titled &#34;Reciprocal Sequential Recommendation&#34; with an abstract that discusses a new approach for reciprocal recommender systems (RRS). 

First, I&#39;ll break down the key components of the title and abstract to identify core themes:

1. **Title Analysis**: &#34;Reciprocal Sequential Recommendation&#34; suggests it&#39;s about recommendation systems where both parties are considered reciprocally. The term &#34;sequential&#34; indicates a focus on time-series or evolving data.

2. **Abstract Breakdown**:
   - RRS (reciprocal recommender system) is used in platforms like dating and recruitment, which are specific domains.
   - It addresses the limitation of static user preferences and focuses on dynamic modeling for both parties over time.
   - Introduces a new approach called ReSeq, utilizing co-attention mechanisms and self-distillation for efficiency.

3. **Mapping to Categories**:
   - **Algorithm Family**: The article uses techniques like co-attention mechanism and self-distillation, which are part of attention-based models.
   - **Domain Specific**: It applies to online dating and recruitment, so under domain categories, &#34;Dating&#34; and &#34;Recruitment&#34; fit.
   - **Recommendation Types**: Reciprocal recommendations imply mutual matching, so this is a specific aspect in recommendation space.
   - **Sequential Recommendation** is explicitly mentioned, focusing on dynamic user modeling over time.
   - **Efficiency Aspects**: The use of self-distillation for inference efficiency ties into scalable algorithms and efficient computation techniques.

4. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Real-world applications are addressed through experiments on datasets from dating and recruitment scenarios.
   - Evaluation aspects include effectiveness and efficiency, which relate to assessing recommendation systems beyond just accuracy.
   - The problem is a variation in sequential recommendation, so &#34;Variation of Sequential Recommendation&#34; makes sense.

5. **Ensuring Clarity and User-Centric Design**:
   - Categories should be clear enough for users searching by these terms. For example, someone interested in dating apps might search under &#34;Dating,&#34; while another looking into efficiency might look under &#34;Inference Efficiency.&#34;

6. **Avoid Overcrowding**:
   - By assigning a mix of broad (e.g., Sequential Recommendation) and specific categories (e.g., Dating, Recruitment), we ensure a balanced distribution without overwhelming any single category.

7. **Consistency Check**:
   - All categorizations align with the article&#39;s focus on reciprocal dynamics in sequential recommendation, efficient methods, and real-world application domains.

I need to make sure each assigned category is relevant and that there are at least 8-12 categories as per guidelines. The list should cover all aspects without redundancy, ensuring discoverability for various user interests.

Alright, I&#39;m looking at this research article titled &#34;Reciprocal Sequential Recommendation.&#34; The abstract mentions that reciprocal recommender systems are used in online platforms like dating and recruitment. It talks about how existing models focus on static user preferences but neglect evolving tastes and dynamic matching between two parties.

The paper formulates RRS as a sequence matching task and proposes ReSeq, using co-attention mechanisms for fine-grained similarities and self-distillation for efficiency. They tested it on five datasets across two scenarios and found it effective.

So, to categorize this article:

1. **Reciprocal Recommender Systems**: Directly relevant since the paper focuses on RRS.
2. **Sequential Recommendation**: As the proposed method is sequential.
3. **User Modeling**: It deals with evolving user preferences.
4. **Attention Mechanism**: Co-attention is a key technique used.
5. **Efficiency and Scalability**: The self-distillation improves inference efficiency, so scalability is relevant here.
6. **Real-World Applications**: They tested on real datasets from two scenarios, indicating practical applications.
7. **Duel-Perspective Matching**: Since it captures both parties&#39; matching.
8. **Evaluation Metrics**: Although not explicitly mentioned, the experiments show effectiveness, which relates to evaluation.

I think these categories cover the main aspects of the article without being too narrow or too broad, ensuring a good balance for user navigation.
&lt;/think&gt;
