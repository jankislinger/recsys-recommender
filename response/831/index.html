        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Dynamic Surrogate Switching: Sample-Efficient Search for Factorization Machine Configurations in Online Recommendations
Abstract:
Hyperparameter optimization is the process of identifying the appropriate hyperparameter configuration of a given machine learning model with regard to a given learning task. For smaller data sets, an exhaustive search is possible; However, when the data size and model complexity increase, the number of configuration evaluations becomes the main computational bottleneck. A promising paradigm for tackling this type of problem is surrogate-based optimization. The main idea underlying this paradigm considers an incrementally updated model of the relation between the hyperparameter space and the output (target) space; the data for this model are obtained by evaluating the main learning engine, which is, for example, a factorization machine-based model. By learning to approximate the hyperparameter-target relation, the surrogate (machine learning) model can be used to score large amounts of hyperparameter configurations, exploring parts of the configuration space beyond the reach of direct machine learning engine evaluation. Commonly, a surrogate is selected prior to optimization initialization and remains the same during the search. We investigated whether dynamic switching of surrogates during the optimization itself is a sensible idea of practical relevance for selecting the most appropriate factorization machine-based models for large-scale online recommendation. We conducted benchmarks on data sets containing hundreds of millions of instances against established baselines such as Random Forest- and Gaussian process-based surrogates. The results indicate that surrogate switching can offer good performance while considering fewer learning engine evaluations.

Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about Dynamic Surrogate Switching for Factorization Machine Configurations in Online Recommendations. Let&#39;s break down the key points from the title and abstract.

First, the title mentions &#34;Dynamic Surrogate Switching&#34; which sounds like a method or algorithm used for optimizing hyperparameters. The context is factorization machines, which I know are a type of recommendation system model. So that gives me categories related to algorithms: Factorization Machines definitely fit here. Since it&#39;s about hyperparameter optimization, Hyperparameter Optimization should be another category.

The abstract talks about using surrogate models during the optimization process. Surrogate-based optimization is a strategy in machine learning where an approximate model (surrogate) is used to guide the search for optimal parameters because evaluating the actual model can be computationally expensive. So Surrogate Models makes sense as a category.

They mention comparing against Random Forest and Gaussian Process surrogates, which are specific types of algorithms. Including these will help users interested in those particular methods find the article.

The problem domain is online recommendations, so that&#39;s another clear category. It&#39;s specifically about large-scale systems, hence Large-Scale Recommendations would be appropriate.

Looking at the evaluation aspects, they conducted benchmarks with hundreds of millions of instances. Evaluation Metrics would cover how performance was measured. Since hyperparameter optimization affects model accuracy and efficiency, Beyond Accuracy is relevant because it implies considering other factors beyond just prediction correctness, like computational cost or scalability.

The study&#39;s aim is to improve sample efficiency by using dynamic surrogate switching, which reduces the number of evaluations needed. So Sample Efficiency is a key point here. It also relates to search strategies in optimization, so Search Strategies should be included.

They tested their approach against established baselines, which ties into Benchmarking. The application is real-world, specifically in online recommendation systems, so Real-World Applications fits well.

Putting it all together, the categories cover the specific algorithm (Factorization Machines), the method (Hyperparameter Optimization), the strategies and models used (Surrogate Models, Random Forest, Gaussian Process), the domain (Online Recommendations), evaluation aspects (Evaluation Metrics, Beyond Accuracy), efficiency improvements (Sample Efficiency), methodology (Search Strategies, Benchmarking), and application context (Real-World Applications).

I should make sure each category is clear and relevant. I think this covers the necessary ground without being too granular, ensuring users can easily navigate to find related articles.
&lt;/think&gt;
