Title: Leveraging Large Language Models for Sequential Recommendation
Abstract:
Sequential recommendation problems have received increasing attention in research during the past few years, leading to the inception of a large variety of algorithmic approaches. In this work, we explore how large language models (LLMs), which are nowadays introducing disruptive effects in many AI-based applications, can be used to build or improve sequential recommendation approaches. Specifically, we devise and evaluate three approaches to leverage the power of LLMs in different ways. Our results from experiments on two datasets show that initializing the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation model BERT4Rec with embeddings obtained from an LLM improves NDCG by 15-20% compared to the vanilla BERT4Rec model. Furthermore, we find that a simple approach that leverages LLM embeddings for producing recommendations, can provide competitive performance by highlighting semantically related items. We publicly share the code and data of our experiments to ensure reproducibility.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article about leveraging large language models for sequential recommendation. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Leveraging Large Language Models for Sequential Recommendation.&#34; So right away, I can note down &#34;Large Language Models&#34; and &#34;Sequential Recommendation.&#34;

Looking at the abstract, it talks about sequential recommendation problems and algorithmic approaches. They explore using LLMs in different ways to improve these recommendations. That gives me a few more categories: &#34;Algorithmic Approaches,&#34; &#34;Recommendation Systems,&#34; and perhaps &#34;Natural Language Processing&#34; since they&#39;re using language models.

The work evaluates three approaches and shares code/data for reproducibility. So &#34;Evaluation Methods,&#34; &#34;Reproducibility,&#34; and maybe &#34;Research Methods&#34; could be relevant here.

They mention experiments on two datasets, so &#34;Datasets&#34; is another category. They discuss initializing a state-of-the-art model (BERT4Rec) with embeddings from LLMs, which improved NDCG by 15-20%. This suggests categories like &#34;Performance Improvement,&#34; &#34;Embeddings,&#34; and maybe something related to specific models or techniques like &#34;Pre-trained Models.&#34;

They also talk about competitive performance by leveraging semantically related items, so &#34;Semantic Analysis&#34; seems appropriate.

Putting it all together, I should assign the article to categories that reflect both its methods (like LLMs, embeddings), its focus areas (sequential recommendation, recommendation systems), and aspects of evaluation and reproducibility. I need at least 8-12 categories, so let me make sure each one is relevant.

I might also consider if there are broader categories like &#34;Machine Learning&#34; or specific techniques like &#34;Transfer Learning,&#34; but based on the given examples, perhaps sticking to more specific terms related to recommendation systems and LLMs would be better. 

Wait, does the article mention any real-world applications? The abstract doesn&#39;t specify A/B tests or user surveys, so maybe skip that for now.

So my categories would include: Large Language Models, Sequential Recommendation, Algorithmic Approaches, Recommendation Systems, Evaluation Methods, Natural Language Processing, Performance Improvement, Embeddings, Reproducibility, Datasets, and perhaps &#34;Research Methods.&#34;

I think that&#39;s a solid set. Let me make sure each category is clear and user-friendly.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Leveraging Large Language Models for Sequential Recommendation.&#34; Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title suggests that the article is about using large language models (LLMs) in sequential recommendation. So, first thing that comes to mind is that it&#39;s related to recommendation systems, specifically sequential ones. That makes sense because sequential recommendations are all about predicting what a user will like next based on their interaction history.

Looking at the abstract, they mention that LLMs are being used to build or improve sequential recommendation approaches. They evaluated three different methods and tested them on two datasets. The results showed significant improvements in metrics like NDCG when using LLM embeddings with BERT4Rec, which is a state-of-the-art model.

So, key points from the abstract: they&#39;re using LLMs for sequential recommendations, comparing different approaches, and evaluating performance metrics. They also highlight the semantic aspects because they mention that the LLM helps in highlighting semantically related items.

Now, mapping this to the categories:

1. **Family of Algorithm**: The article talks about BERT4Rec and uses embeddings from LLMs. So, BERT4Rec is a Transformer-based model, which falls under the Transformer family. Also, since they&#39;re using LLMs, that&#39;s another algorithmic approach.

2. **Domain of the Problem**: Sequential recommendation is specifically mentioned, so that&#39;s a primary category. They didn&#39;t specify any particular domain like movies or books, but it&#39;s general sequential recommendations, so just &#34;Sequential Recommendation.&#34;

3. **Recommendation Space Specificity**: The abstract mentions leveraging LLMs in different ways and evaluating their impact on performance. This seems to be about improving existing models rather than addressing a specific challenge like cold start or diversity.

4. **Evaluation Aspects**: They used NDCG as a metric, which is a common evaluation metric for recommendation systems. Additionally, they talk about competitive performance, so &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; might apply since it&#39;s not just about getting recommendations right but also about the quality and relevance of those recommendations.

5. **Real-World Applications**: The article mentions sharing code and data publicly for reproducibility, which suggests that there is an intention towards real-world applications or at least practical implementation.

6. **Other Relevant Categories**: Since they&#39;re using LLMs, that&#39;s another key aspect. Also, the focus on semantics indicates that semantic understanding plays a role in their recommendations.

Putting it all together, I&#39;ll list out the categories: Sequential Recommendation, Transformer, Large Language Models (LLMs), Evaluation Metrics, Performance Improvement, Semantic Understanding, Real-World Applications, and Public Code Sharing.
&lt;/think&gt;

Sequential Recommendation, Transformer, Large Language Models, Evaluation Metrics, Performance Improvement, Semantic Understanding, Real-World Applications, Public Code Sharing</code></pre>
