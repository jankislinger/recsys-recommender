Title: Recommending for a Multi-Sided Marketplace with Heterogeneous Contents
Abstract:
Many online personalization platforms today are recommending heterogeneous contents in a multi-sided marketplace consisting of consumers, merchants and other partners. For a recommender system to be successful in these contexts, it faces two main challenges. First, each side in the marketplace has different and potentially conflicting utilities. Recommending for a multi-sided marketplace therefore entails jointly optimizing multiple objectives with trade-offs. Second, the off-the-shelf recommendation algorithms are not applicable to the heterogeneous content space, where a recommendation item could be an aggregation of other recommendation items. In this work, we develop a general framework for recommender systems in a multi-sided marketplace with heterogeneous and hierarchical contents. We propose a constrained optimization framework with machine learning models for each objective as inputs, and a probabilistic structural model for users’ engagement patterns on heterogeneous contents. Our proposed structural modeling approach ensures consistent user experience across different levels of aggregation of the contents, and provides levels of transparency to the merchants and content providers. We further develop an efficient optimization solution for ranking and recommendation in large-scale online systems in real time. We implement the framework at Uber Eats, one of the largest online food delivery platforms in the world and a three-sided marketplace consisting of eaters, restaurant partners and delivery partners. Online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in ranking heterogeneous contents and optimizing for the three sides in the marketplace. Our framework has been deployed globally as the recommendation algorithm for Uber Eats’ homepage.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about Recommending for a Multi-Sided Marketplace with Heterogeneous Contents. The goal is to assign it to multiple relevant categories based on its content. Let me break down what the article is about.

First, the title mentions &#34;Multi- Sided Marketplace&#34; which suggests that it&#39;s dealing with platforms where there are different types of users or entities involved, like consumers and merchants. That makes me think of e-commerce platforms or services like Uber Eats, as mentioned in the abstract. So categories related to multi-sided marketplaces would definitely be relevant.

The abstract talks about heterogeneous contents, meaning the recommendation system deals with various types of items, not just one kind. This could include different products, services, or aggregated content. So a category for Heterogeneous Content makes sense here.

It also mentions that each side in the marketplace has different utilities which might conflict. The recommender system needs to optimize multiple objectives with trade-offs. This brings up the idea of Multi-Objective Optimization as another key category.

The article proposes a constrained optimization framework using machine learning models for each objective. So categories like Constrained Optimization and Machine Learning Models are important here.

There&#39;s a focus on user engagement patterns, specifically with heterogeneous contents, so User Engagement is another relevant category. The framework ensures consistent user experience across different content aggregations, which ties into User Experience as well.

Transparency to merchants and content providers is mentioned, indicating that the system provides some level of insight or control for these stakeholders. So Transparency could be a suitable category.

The article also discusses real-world applications since they implemented the framework at Uber Eats and conducted online experiments. This points towards categories like Real-World Application and A/B Testing (since they ran experiments to test effectiveness).

Additionally, the abstract mentions that this is applied in a food delivery platform, so Food Delivery Platforms would be another specific category. The framework was deployed globally, which might relate to Global Applications.

Looking at other aspects, since it&#39;s about recommendation systems optimizing for multiple sides and heterogeneous content, categories like Marketplace Optimization and Aggregated Content could also apply.

I should ensure that each article is placed in at least 8-12 categories, so I&#39;ll compile all these points into the required number of relevant categories without overcrowding any.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. The title is &#34;Recommending for a Multi-Sided Marketplace with Heterogeneous Contents.&#34; It sounds like it&#39;s about recommendation systems in environments where there are multiple stakeholders involved, not just one.

The abstract mentions that the platform involves consumers, merchants, and other partners. So this is definitely a multi-sided marketplace scenario. The challenges here include optimizing multiple objectives because each side has different utilities which might conflict. That means the recommender system has to balance various goals, which adds complexity.

Another key point in the abstract is the mention of heterogeneous contents. This refers to diverse types of items being recommended, not just one type. So the recommendation system needs to handle a variety of content, which isn&#39;t straightforward with traditional algorithms. The paper talks about developing a general framework for such systems and proposes specific models like constrained optimization and probabilistic structural modeling.

They also implemented this framework at Uber Eats, which is a three-sided marketplace involving eaters, restaurants, and delivery partners. The experiments show effectiveness in ranking and recommendation, so real-world application is a big part of this research.

Looking at the categories provided in the guidelines, I should think about family of algorithms, domains, specific aspects in recommendations, evaluation aspects, real-world applications, etc.

1. **Multi-Sided Marketplace**: Directly related to the context described.
2. **Heterogeneous Contents**: Since they deal with diverse recommendation items.
3. **Recommender Systems**: Core topic of the paper.
4. **Algorithm Design**: As they propose a new framework and optimization solution.
5. **Real-World Applications**: They applied it at Uber Eats, so this is relevant.
6. **Optimization**: The paper discusses efficient optimization solutions.
7. **User Experience**: They talk about consistent user experience across different content aggregations.
8. **Evaluation Metrics**: Although not explicitly mentioned, the experiments in real-world settings imply evaluation aspects.

I think these categories capture the essence of the article and align with the guidelines provided. Each category is relevant and should help users navigate the research effectively.
&lt;/think&gt;
