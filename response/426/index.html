Title: Adversarial Attacks on an Oblivious Recommender
Abstract:
Can machine learning models be easily fooled? Despite the recent surge of interest in  learned adversarial attacks in other domains, in the context of recommendation systems this question has mainly been answered using hand-engineered fake user profiles. This paper attempts to reduce this gap. We provide a formulation for learning to attack a recommender as a repeated general-sum game between two players, i.e., an adversary and a recommender oblivious to the adversary’s existence. We consider the challenging case of poisoning attacks, which focus on the training phase of the recommender model. We generate adversarial user profiles targeting subsets of users or items, or generally the top-K recommendation quality. Moreover, we ensure that the adversarial user profiles remain unnoticeable by preserving proximity of the real user rating/ interaction distribution to the adversarial fake user distribution. To cope with the challenge of the adversary not having access to the gradient of the recommender’s objective with respect to the fake user profiles, we provide a non-trivial algorithm building upon zero-order optimization techniques. We offer a wide range of experiments, instantiating the proposed method for the case of the classic popular approach of a low-rank recommender, and illustrating the extent of the recommender’s vulnerability to a variety of adversarial intents. These results can serve as a motivating point for more research into recommender defense strategies against machine learned attacks.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Okay, so I need to categorize this article titled &#34;Adversarial Attacks on an Oblivious Recommender&#34; and its abstract into multiple relevant categories based on the guidelines provided. Let me break down the process step by step.

First, I&#39;ll read through the title and abstract carefully to understand the core themes and content of the article. The title mentions adversarial attacks on a recommender system, so that&#39;s my starting point. The abstract explains that machine learning models can be fooled, but in recommendation systems, this has been addressed mainly with hand-engineered fake user profiles. This paper introduces a formulation where an adversary and a recommender engage in a repeated general-sum game. It specifically looks at poisoning attacks during the training phase, targeting subsets of users or items, and ensuring that adversarial user profiles remain unnoticeable by preserving distribution proximity.

The abstract also mentions using zero-order optimization techniques because the adversary doesn&#39;t have access to the gradient of the recommender&#39;s objective. Experiments are conducted with a low-rank recommender model, showing vulnerability to various adversarial intents, suggesting the need for defense strategies.

Now, considering the guidelines, I need to assign at least 8-12 categories. Let me start by identifying key elements from the title and abstract:

1. **Adversarial Attacks**: The primary focus is on how machine learning models in recommendation systems can be attacked adversarially.
2. **Recommender Systems**: Clearly, this is about recommendation systems.
3. **Machine Learning**: Since the attacks are machine learning-based.
4. **Game Theory**: The interaction between adversary and recommender is framed as a game.
5. **Poisoning Attacks**: A specific type of adversarial attack focused on the training phase.
6. **User Profiling**: Creating fake user profiles to attack the system.
7. **Distribution Preservation**: Ensuring adversarial profiles aren&#39;t detectable by maintaining distribution proximity.
8. **Zero-Order Optimization**: The method used due to lack of gradient access.
9. **Low-Rank Recommenders**: A classic approach used in experiments.
10. **Defense Mechanisms**: The paper suggests the need for defending against such attacks.

Now, mapping these elements into categories:

- Adversarial Attacks: Directly from the title and abstract.
- Recommender Systems: Core domain.
- Machine Learning: Underlying technology.
- Game Theory: Framework used to model interactions.
- Poisoning Attacks: Specific attack type.
- User Profiling: Technique used in attacks.
- Distribution Preservation: Methodology aspect.
- Zero-Order Optimization: Technical method discussed.
- Low-Rank Recommenders: Example of the system attacked.
- Security and Defense: Broader category that encompasses defense mechanisms.

I need to ensure these categories are clear, descriptive, and useful for navigation. Let me check if each category is distinct and relevant:

- Adversarial Attacks: Yes, central theme.
- Recommender Systems: Correct domain.
- Machine Learning: Applicable as the system uses ML models.
- Game Theory: Fits because of the game framework between adversary and recommender.
- Poisoning Attacks: Specific attack type addressed.
- User Profiling: Technique used in creating attacks.
- Distribution Preservation: A method to make attacks undetectable.
- Zero-Order Optimization: Technical approach for adversarial examples without gradients.
- Low-Rank Recommenders: Classic example, so it&#39;s a specific category.
- Security and Defense: Broader category that covers defense aspects.

I think these cover the key points. I might consider adding &#34;Training Phase&#34; as another category since the attacks target the training phase, but looking at the guidelines, perhaps &#34;Poisoning Attacks&#34; already encapsulates that aspect. Alternatively, &#34;Defense Mechanisms&#34; is more specific than just security, but in the output, the user used &#34;Security and Defense,&#34; so maybe I should stick with that broader term.

Another thought: since the paper discusses both attacks and defense needs, including &#34;Defense Mechanisms&#34; might be beneficial to highlight that aspect for users interested in protection strategies. However, based on the example provided, they included more specific terms like &#34;Cold Start&#34; or &#34;A/B Test,&#34; but here it&#39;s about security, so perhaps combining into one category is better.

I should also ensure each category is user-friendly and not too technical unless necessary. For instance, &#34;Zero-Order Optimization&#34; is a bit technical but relevant because it&#39;s a specific method used in the paper.

Let me see if I can think of any other categories that might fit:

- Real-world Applications: The paper doesn&#39;t mention real applications; it&#39;s more about theoretical attacks.
- Evaluation Aspects: While they do experiments, the categories like &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; or &#34;Diversity&#34; aren&#39;t directly addressed here. The focus is on attack methods and system vulnerabilities.

So sticking with the initial list seems appropriate. Now, compiling them into a comma-separated list without using any markdown formatting as per instructions.

Alright, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this article titled &#34;Adversarial Attacks on an Oblivious Recommender.&#34; Let me read through the abstract carefully to understand what it&#39;s about.

The paper discusses how machine learning models can be fooled in recommendation systems. It mentions that while adversarial attacks are a hot topic elsewhere, in recommendations, they&#39;ve mainly been tested with fake user profiles. Here, they&#39;re taking a different approach by formulating these attacks as a game between two players: the adversary and the recommender.

They specifically look at poisoning attacks during the training phase of the recommender model. The adversarial users create fake profiles that target specific subsets of users or items, or even aim to lower the quality of top-K recommendations. To make these fake profiles believable, they maintain similarity between real user distributions and the fake ones.

The challenge here is that the adversary doesn&#39;t have access to the gradient of the recommender&#39;s objective with respect to the fake profiles. So, they&#39;re using a zero-order optimization algorithm to overcome this limitation.

They test their method on low-rank recommenders, showing how vulnerable these systems are to various adversarial intents. This research is meant to highlight the need for better defense strategies in recommendation models.

Now, I need to assign multiple categories to this article. Let&#39;s break it down:

1. **Adversarial Attacks**: The core topic is about creating and testing these attacks on recommenders.
2. **Recommender Systems**: It&#39;s all about recommendation systems, so that&#39;s a primary category.
3. **Poisoning Attacks**: They specifically talk about poisoning the training data with adversarial examples.
4. **Robustness**: This relates to how vulnerable the system is and the need for defense strategies.
5. **Zero-Order Optimization**: The paper introduces an algorithm using this technique, so it&#39;s relevant here.
6. **Low-Rank Models**: They test their method on low-rank recommenders, which is a specific model type.
7. **Game Theory**: The adversarial scenario is framed as a game between two players.
8. **User Profiling**: Since they create fake user profiles to attack the system, this category fits.
9. **Security**: It&#39;s about securing recommendation systems against attacks.

I should also consider if there are any other aspects that fit. They mention evaluation but it&#39;s more about adversarial intents rather than general evaluation metrics. So maybe sticking with the above categories is better.

I think these categories cover all the key points from the abstract and title, ensuring the article is discoverable under relevant topics.
&lt;/think&gt;
