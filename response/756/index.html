        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: EANA: Reducing Privacy Risk on Large-scale Recommendation Models
Abstract:
Embedding-based deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in large-scale recommendation systems. Differentially-private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) provides a way to enable personalized experiences while preserving user privacy by injecting noise into every model parameter during the training process. However, it is challenging to apply DP-SGD to large-scale embedding-based DNNs due to its effect on training speed. This happens because the noise added by DP-SGD causes normally sparse gradients to become dense, introducing a large communication overhead between workers and parameter servers in a typical distributed training framework. This paper proposes embedding-aware noise addition (EANA) to mitigate the communication overhead, making training a large-scale embedding-based DNN possible. We examine the privacy benefit of EANA both analytically and empirically using secret sharer techniques. We demonstrate that training with EANA can achieve reasonable model precision while providing good practical privacy protection as measured by the secret sharer tests. Experiments on a real-world, large-scale dataset and model show that EANA is much faster than standard DP-SGD, improving the training speed by 54X and unblocking the training of a large-scale embedding-based DNN with reduced privacy risk.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;EANA: Reducing Privacy Risk on Large-scale Recommendation Models.&#34; Let&#39;s start by reading through the title and abstract to understand the main themes.

The title mentions reducing privacy risks in large-scale recommendation models, so that immediately points me towards categories related to privacy, recommendation systems, and scalability. The abstract goes into more detail about embedding-based deep neural networks (DNNs) and how they&#39;re used in recommendation systems. That tells me that the family of algorithms here includes DNNs and embeddings.

The paper talks about differentially-private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), which is a method to add privacy while training models. They mention challenges with DP-SGD in large-scale settings because it slows down training by making gradients dense, leading to communication overhead between workers and parameter servers. So the problem domain here is large-scale recommendation systems, and they&#39;re addressing scalability issues.

The proposed solution is EANA (Embedding-aware noise addition), which aims to mitigate communication overhead while maintaining privacy. This means the article focuses on optimization techniques specific to embeddings in recommendation systems. The experiments show significant improvements in training speed, so efficiency is a key aspect here.

Looking at evaluation aspects, they use secret sharer techniques for both analytical and empirical assessments of privacy benefits. They also demonstrate practical privacy protection through these tests, which ties back into the evaluation metrics around privacy and performance.

Real-world applications are mentioned with experiments on large datasets, showing how EANA can be applied in actual recommendation systems. This brings in categories related to real-world applications and A/B testing since they&#39;re comparing their method against standard DP-SGD.

Putting it all together, the categories should cover both the technical aspects (like DNNs, embeddings, privacy-preserving methods), the problem areas (large-scale recommendation, scalability, communication efficiency), evaluation metrics (privacy protection, model precision), and real-world application contexts.
&lt;/think&gt;
