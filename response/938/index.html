        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Multiple Connectivity Views for Session-based Recommendation
Abstract:
Session-based recommendation (SBR), which makes the next-item recommendation based on previous anonymous actions, has drawn increasing attention. The last decade has seen multiple deep learning-based modeling choices applied on SBR successfully, e.g., recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and each modeling choice has its intrinsic superiority and limitation. We argue that these modeling choices differentiate from each other by (1) the way they capture the interactions between items within a session and (2) the operators they adopt for composing the neural network, e.g., convolutional operator or self-attention operator. In this work, we dive deep into the former as it is relatively unique to the SBR scenario, while the latter is shared by general neural network modeling techniques. We first introduce the concept of connectivity view to describe the different item interaction patterns at the input level. Then, we develop the Multiple Connectivity Views for Session-based Recommendation (MCV-SBR), a unified framework that incorporates different modeling choices in a single model through the lens of connectivity view. In addition, MCV-SBR allows us to effectively and efficiently explore the search space of the combinations of connectivity views by the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator Approach (TPE) algorithm. Finally, on three widely used SBR datasets, we verify the superiority of MCV-SBR by comparing the searched models with state-of-the-art baselines. We also conduct a series of studies to demonstrate the efficacy and practicability of the proposed connectivity view search algorithm, as well as other components in MCV-SBR.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

The title is &#34;Multiple Connectivity Views for Session-based Recommendation,&#34; which suggests it&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically focusing on session-based recommendations. The abstract mentions that session-based recommendation (SBR) uses anonymous actions to recommend the next item. It also discusses various deep learning models like RNNs, CNNs, and GNNs applied to SBR.

The authors argue that these models differ in how they capture interactions between items within a session and the operators used for composing neural networks. They introduce the concept of &#34;connectivity view&#34; to describe different item interaction patterns at the input level. The article presents MCV-SBR, a unified framework that incorporates various modeling choices through connectivity views and uses TPE algorithm for exploring combinations.

Now, I&#39;ll identify key elements from this:

1. **Session-based recommendation**: Directly mentioned in both title and abstract.
2. **Deep learning models**: They discuss RNNs, CNNs, GNNs, so &#34;Neural Networks&#34; is relevant.
3. **Connectivity views**: This seems like a specific concept introduced by the authors, so it should be a category.
4. **Modeling choices in SBR**: Since they compare different models and their effectiveness.
5. **Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)**: An algorithm used for hyperparameter optimization here.
6. **Unsupervised learning**: The article deals with anonymous actions, which might fall under unsupervised methods.
7. **Evaluation studies**: They conducted experiments on datasets and compared models.
8. **Recommendation algorithms**: Broad category covering recommendation systems.

I should ensure each category is clear and relevant. &#34;Session-based Recommendation&#34; captures the specific focus. &#34;Neural Networks&#34; covers the deep learning aspect. &#34;Connectivity Views&#34; is a unique contribution here. &#34;Modeling Choices in SBR&#34; helps users interested in different approaches within session recommendations.

Including &#34;Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)&#34; makes sense because it&#39;s a key part of their method for exploring model combinations. &#34;Unsupervised Learning&#34; fits since the data is based on anonymous actions without labeled outcomes. &#34;Evaluation Studies&#34; highlights that they tested their framework against existing methods.

I need to avoid creating too narrow categories but also ensure each category is specific enough to be useful. For example, instead of just saying &#34;deep learning,&#34; breaking it down into &#34;Neural Networks&#34; and &#34;Recommendation Algorithms&#34; provides more granularity for users searching in these areas.

Considering user-centric design, someone looking into session-based recommendations would benefit from finding this under that specific category as well as broader recommendation algorithm categories. Also, including the evaluation aspect helps those interested in how effective such frameworks are.

I think I&#39;ve covered all necessary aspects without overlapping too much. Now, I&#39;ll list these categories ensuring they are clear and concise.
&lt;/think&gt;
