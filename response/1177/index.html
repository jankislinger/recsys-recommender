        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Taming the One-Epoch Phenomenon in Online Recommendation System by Two-stage Contrastive ID Pre-training
Abstract:
ID-based embeddings are widely used in web-scale online recommendation systems. However, their susceptibility to overfitting, particularly due to the long-tail nature of data distributions, often limits training to a single epoch, a phenomenon known as the “one-epoch problem.” This challenge has driven research efforts to optimize performance within the first epoch by enhancing convergence speed or feature sparsity. In this study, we introduce a novel two-stage training strategy that incorporates a pre-training phase using a minimal model with contrastive loss, enabling broader data coverage for the embedding system. Our offline experiments demonstrate that multi-epoch training during the pre-training phase does not lead to overfitting, and the resulting embeddings improve online generalization when fine-tuned for more complex downstream recommendation tasks. We deployed the proposed system in live traffic at Pinterest, achieving significant site-wide engagement gains.

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on the guidelines provided. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Taming the One-Epoch Phenomenon in Online Recommendation System by Two-stage Contrastive ID Pre-Training.&#34; From the title alone, it seems like the article is about recommendation systems, specifically addressing a phenomenon called the one-epoch problem. It mentions using a two-stage contrastive pre-training method to tackle this issue.

Looking at the abstract, the authors discuss how ID-based embeddings are used in web-scale online recommendation systems but face overfitting issues due to long-tail data distributions. This leads to training being limited to just one epoch, which is referred to as the &#34;one-epoch problem.&#34; They propose a two-stage training strategy with a pre-training phase using a minimal model and contrastive loss to improve convergence speed and feature sparsity. Their experiments show that multi-epoch training doesn&#39;t cause overfitting and enhances online generalization. The system was deployed at Pinterest, leading to increased engagement.

Now, I need to break down the key elements here:

1. **Recommendation Systems**: Clearly, this is a core area as the article focuses on improving recommendation algorithms.
2. **Online Recommendation**: Since it&#39;s about real-time or live systems, &#34;Online&#34; is an important aspect.
3. **Web-Scale**: The application is in large-scale web environments, so that&#39;s another category.
4. **ID-Based Embeddings**: This refers to the method used for recommendations, which is a specific technique within recommendation systems.
5. **Overfitting and One-Epoch Problem**: These are challenges addressed in the article, so they should be included as categories.
6. **Contrastive Pre-training**: The method used to pre-train models, which is a key part of their solution.
7. **Two-Stage Training Strategy**: Another specific technique they employ.
8. **Feature Sparsity and Convergence Speed**: These are aspects related to model performance that the article addresses.
9. **Multi-Epoch Training**: This is part of their approach, contrasting with single epoch training.
10. **Generalization in Recommendations**: The improvement achieved through their method is about better generalization.
11. **Real-World Applications**: They applied this at Pinterest, so real-world application is relevant.
12. **Evaluation Methods**: They conducted offline experiments and online A/B tests to validate their approach.

I should also consider if there are other potential categories that fit the examples given. For instance, it touches on aspects like scalability since it&#39;s a web-scale system, but I think &#34;Web-Scale&#34; already covers that. It might also relate to evaluation metrics beyond accuracy because they mention generalization and feature sparsity, which go beyond traditional accuracy measures.

I should ensure each category is clear and user-friendly. Categories like &#34;ID-Based Embeddings&#34; or &#34;Contrastive Pre-training&#34; are specific enough but still meaningful. Also, ensuring that the categories align with what users might be interested in when searching for such articles.

Finally, I need to make sure there are at least 8-12 categories without overcrowding any single category. Let me list them out:

- Recommendation Systems: Core area.
- Online Recommendation: Specific application.
- Web-Scale: Indicates the system&#39;s scale.
- ID-Based Embeddings: Technique used.
- Overfitting: Challenge addressed.
- One-Epoch Problem: The specific issue tackled.
- Contrastive Pre-training: Method employed.
- Two-Stage Training Strategy: Approach taken.
- Feature Sparsity: Aspect of model performance.
- Convergence Speed: Another aspect of the model&#39;s efficiency.
- Multi-Epoch Training: Part of their solution.
- Generalization in Recommendations: Outcome achieved.
- Real-World Applications: Where it was applied.
- Evaluation Methods: How they tested their approach.

I think these 14 categories cover all aspects without being too granular. They balance between specific techniques, challenges addressed, outcomes, and application contexts, which should help users find the article based on different interests.
&lt;/think&gt;
