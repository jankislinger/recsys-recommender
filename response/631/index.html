Title: Black-Box Attacks on Sequential Recommenders via Data-Free Model Extraction
Abstract:
We investigate whether model extraction can be used to ‘steal’ the weights of sequential recommender systems, and the potential threats posed to victims of such attacks. This type of risk has attracted attention in image and text classification, but to our knowledge not in recommender systems. We argue that sequential recommender systems are subject to unique vulnerabilities due to the specific autoregressive regimes used to train them. Unlike many existing recommender attackers, which assume the dataset used to train the victim model is exposed to attackers, we consider a data-free setting, where training data are not accessible. Under this setting, we propose an API-based model extraction method via limited-budget synthetic data generation and knowledge distillation. We investigate state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendation and show their vulnerability under model extraction and downstream attacks. We perform attacks in two stages. (1) Model extraction: given different types of synthetic data and their labels retrieved from a black-box recommender, we extract the black-box model to a white-box model via distillation. (2) Downstream attacks: we attack the black-box model with adversarial samples generated by the white-box recommender. Experiments show the effectiveness of our data-free model extraction and downstream attacks on sequential recommenders in both profile pollution and data poisoning settings.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by understanding what the article is about.

The title is &#34;Black-Box Attacks on Sequential Recommenders via Data-Free Model Extraction.&#34; From that, it seems like the article discusses attacks on recommendation systems, specifically sequential ones, using a method that doesn&#39;t require access to training data—data-free model extraction.

Looking at the abstract, the authors explore whether model extraction can be used to steal the weights of sequential recommender systems. They mention that this risk has been studied in image and text classification but not in recommenders. Sequential recommenders have unique vulnerabilities because of their autoregressive training methods. The article considers a data-free setting where attackers don&#39;t have access to the training data, which is different from existing attacks that assume dataset exposure.

They propose an API-based model extraction method using synthetic data generation and knowledge distillation. They test this on state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendation and show they&#39;re vulnerable under these attacks. The attack has two stages: first extracting the black-box model to a white-box one, then using adversarial samples generated from the white-box model to attack the original black-box model.

Experiments demonstrate effectiveness in profile pollution and data poisoning scenarios.

So, what categories can this fall into? Let&#39;s break it down:

1. **Security &amp; Privacy**: Definitely relevant because it deals with attacks on recommendation systems and security vulnerabilities.
2. **Sequential Recommendation**: The article focuses specifically on sequential recommenders, so that&#39;s a key category.
3. **Model Extraction/Reverse Engineering**: Since the method involves extracting model weights without data, this is central to the topic.
4. **Adversarial Attacks**: Discussing attacks using adversarial samples makes sense here.
5. **Black-Box Models**: The attack targets black-box models, so this is another category.
6. **Recommendation Systems**: Broadly, it&#39;s about recommenders, so this should be included.
7. **Synthetic Data Generation**: They use synthetic data in their extraction method.
8. **Knowledge Distillation**: This technique is used for model extraction.
9. **Profile Pollution/Toxicity Attacks**: The experiments include profile pollution as an attack vector.
10. **Data Poisoning**: Another type of attack discussed.
11. **Autoregressive Models**: Since sequential recommenders use these, it&#39;s relevant.
12. **Evaluation &amp; Testing Methods**: They&#39;re evaluating the effectiveness of their attacks.

I should make sure each category is clear and user-friendly. I think all these categories are relevant without being too narrow or overlapping. This should help users find related articles easily.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me read through them carefully.

The title is &#34;Black-Box Attacks on Sequential Recommenders via Data-Free Model Extraction.&#34; It sounds like it&#39;s about attacking recommendation systems in a black-box setting without having access to the training data. 

Looking at the abstract, they discuss model extraction attacks on sequential recommenders. They mention that this type of risk hasn&#39;t been explored much in recommender systems before. The method involves using an API-based approach with synthetic data generation and knowledge distillation. They tested it against state-of-the-art models and found vulnerabilities.

So first, I need to identify the core themes here. It&#39;s definitely about model extraction attacks on recommendation systems, specifically sequential ones. That would fall under a family of algorithms like Sequential Recommenders or maybe Deep Learning if they&#39;re using neural networks.

The domain is recommendation systems, so that&#39;s another category. They are looking at security aspects, so Security &amp; Privacy is relevant too. The abstract mentions black-box attacks and API-based methods, which are specific techniques in the recommendation space—so Black-Box Attacks and API-Based Attacks would be good categories.

Since they&#39;re dealing with data-free settings and model extraction, those are important aspects as well. Also, the paper discusses downstream attacks using adversarial samples generated from a white-box model, so Adversarial Examples is another relevant category.

Evaluation-wise, they talk about effectiveness in profile pollution and data poisoning settings. So that could relate to Evaluation Metrics but maybe more specific categories like Model Robustness or Security Testing would be better.

Other aspects include Synthetic Data Generation and Knowledge Distillation as methods used in the paper. These are techniques within the recommendation space, so including them makes sense for discoverability.

Real-world applications might involve security audits or防御 strategies against such attacks, but since it&#39;s more of a theoretical contribution, maybe Real-World Applications isn&#39;t the best fit here.

So putting it all together, the categories should cover the family of algorithms (like Sequential Recommenders and possibly Deep Learning), domain-specific areas like Recommendation Systems and Security &amp; Privacy. Specific techniques used include Black-Box Attacks, API-Based Attacks, Model Extraction, Synthetic Data Generation, Knowledge Distillation, Adversarial Examples, and Downstream Attacks.

I need to make sure each category is clear and relevant without overlapping too much or being too vague. Also, ensuring that there are enough categories as per the guidelines (8-12). Let me list them out again: Sequential Recommenders, Model Extraction, Black-Box Attacks, API-Based Attacks, Synthetic Data Generation, Knowledge Distillation, Adversarial Examples, Security &amp; Privacy, Recommendation Systems, Downstream Attacks, Deep Learning, Model Robustness. That makes 12 categories.

Wait, does that cover everything? The paper is about data-free attacks, so maybe include Data-Free Extraction as a category too. Or perhaps it&#39;s covered under Synthetic Data Generation since they generated synthetic data in the absence of training data. Hmm, maybe better to keep it as is without adding more if possible.

I think I&#39;ve got a good list that covers all the necessary aspects and aligns with user interests in both security and recommendation systems.
&lt;/think&gt;

Sequential Recommenders, Model Extraction, Black-Box Attacks, API-Based Attacks, Synthetic Data Generation, Knowledge Distillation, Adversarial Examples, Security &amp; Privacy, Recommendation Systems, Downstream Attacks, Deep Learning</code></pre>
