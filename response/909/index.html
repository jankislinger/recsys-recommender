Title: Enhancing Transformers without Self-supervised Learning: A Loss Landscape Perspective in Sequential Recommendation
Abstract:
Transformers have become the favored model for sequential recommendation. However, previous studies rely on extensive data, such as massive pre-training or repeated data augmentation, leading to optimization-related problems, such as initialization sensitivity and large batch-size memory bottleneck. In this work, we examine Transformers’ loss geometry to improve the models’ data efficiency during training and generalization. By utilizing a newly introduced sharpness-aware optimizer to promote smoothness, we significantly enhance SASRec’s accuracy and robustness, a Transformer model, on various datasets. When trained on sequential data without significant pre-training or data augmentation, the resulting SASRec outperforms S3Rec and CL4Rec, both of which are of comparable size and throughput.

Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article into relevant categories based on the guidelines provided. Let&#39;s go through it step by step.

First, the title is &#34;Enhancing Transformers without Self-supervised Learning: A Loss Landscape Perspective in Sequential Recommendation.&#34; So right away, I can note that the main topics are Transformers and sequential recommendation. The focus seems to be on improving Transformers without relying on self-supervised learning methods.

Looking at the abstract, it mentions that Transformers have become popular for sequential recommendations but face issues with data efficiency and optimization problems. They examine the loss geometry of Transformers to improve their training efficiency and generalization. They use a sharpness-aware optimizer to make SASRec (a Transformer model) more accurate and robust on various datasets. This approach doesn&#39;t require significant pre-training or data augmentation, which is different from models like S3Rec and CL4Rec.

Now, thinking about the categories. The family of algorithm here is definitely Transformers. The problem domain is sequential recommendation, so that&#39;s another category. They discuss loss landscape analysis, so that should be a specific aspect. Since they&#39;re focusing on optimization techniques without self-supervised learning, that&#39;s another point—so Optimization and Initialization Sensitivity come into play.

They talk about data efficiency and generalization in recommendations, which are important aspects of evaluation beyond just accuracy. The use of a sharpness-aware optimizer is an algorithm modification aimed at improving recommendation systems. They mention scalability because they address issues like batch-size memory bottlenecks, so Scalability is relevant.

The article isn&#39;t focused on cold start or user behavior analysis, but it does relate to sequential recommendations and model improvements in that space. There&#39;s no real-world application mentioned beyond improved performance on datasets, so categories like A/B Test or User Survey don&#39;t apply here. 

Considering all these points, the main categories should cover the algorithm family (Transformers), the domain (sequential recommendation), aspects of evaluation (beyond accuracy and generalization), optimization techniques, loss landscape analysis, data efficiency, initialization sensitivity, and scalability.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about enhancing Transformers in sequential recommendation systems. The title is &#34;Enhancing Transformers without Self-supervised Learning: A Loss Landscape Perspective in Sequential Recommendation.&#34; Let me read through the abstract again to make sure I understand the key points.

The paper talks about how Transformers have become popular for sequential recommendations but face issues because they require a lot of data, like pre-training or augmentation. This leads to problems like sensitivity during initialization and high memory usage with large batches. The authors looked at the loss geometry from a perspective of optimization, using a sharpness-aware optimizer to make the model smoother. They applied this to SASRec and found improvements in accuracy and robustness without heavy pre-processing. It outperformed other models like S3Rec and CL4Rec.

Alright, so I need to assign categories based on the guidelines provided. Let me go through each category example given and see which ones fit.

1. Family of algorithm: The article mentions Transformers, specifically SASRec which is a Transformer-based model for sequential recommendation. So categories could include &#34;Transformers,&#34; maybe also &#34;Sequential Recommendation&#34; as it&#39;s part of the family.

2. Domain of the problem: It&#39;s focused on recommendation systems, so definitely &#34;Recommendation Systems.&#34; Maybe more specific like &#34;Sequential Recommendation.&#34;

3. Specific aspects in recommendation space: They talk about optimization and loss landscape, which are specific technical aspects, so maybe &#34;Optimization,&#34; &#34;Loss Functions,&#34; or &#34;Training Dynamics.&#34; Also, since they&#39;re discussing data efficiency, that&#39;s another aspect.

4. Evaluation aspects: The paper talks about accuracy and robustness, but not specifically about evaluation metrics beyond performance comparisons. So perhaps &#34;Accuracy&#34; as an evaluation metric is relevant.

5. Real-world applications: They mention training on sequential data without heavy pre-training, so maybe something like &#34;Efficient Training&#34; or &#34;Real-World Applications,&#34; though the latter might be too broad.

6. Other categories: Maybe things like &#34;Neural Networks&#34; since Transformers are a type of neural architecture. Also, since they&#39;re discussing optimizers (sharpness-aware), that could be another category like &#34;Optimizers.&#34;

Let me list out possible categories:

- Sequential Recommendation
- Transformers
- Loss Functions
- Optimization
- Training Dynamics
- SASRec
- S3Rec
- CL4Rec
- Efficient Training
- Accuracy
- Neural Networks
- Optimizers
- Data Efficiency

Wait, the guidelines suggest assigning 8-12 categories. I have more than that, but some might overlap or be too specific.

I should ensure each category is broad enough to be useful but specific enough to make sense for navigation. Also, need to avoid creating too narrow categories that won&#39;t have enough articles.

So, let&#39;s refine:

- Sequential Recommendation (domain)
- Transformers (algorithm family)
- Loss Functions (specific aspect in recommendation space)
- Optimization (evaluation aspect, as they improve accuracy and robustness)
- Training Dynamics (related to optimization)
- Efficient Training (as it&#39;s about data efficiency)
- Neural Networks (general category)
- Optimizers (since they introduced a new optimizer)

Maybe &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; as another broad category.

So putting that together: Sequential Recommendation, Transformers, Loss Functions, Optimization, Training Dynamics, Efficient Training, Neural Networks, Optimizers, and maybe Recommendation Systems. That&#39;s nine categories. Let me check if any more are applicable. The abstract also mentions avoiding pre-training, so perhaps &#34;No Pre-training&#34; as a category? But that might be too specific or not commonly used.

Alternatively, considering the model they improved is SASRec, including it in categories for models could be useful but might not be necessary unless many articles focus on different models.

I think I have enough categories. Let me make sure each is clear and relevant.
&lt;/think&gt;

Sequential Recommendation, Transformers, Loss Functions, Optimization, Training Dynamics, Efficient Training, Neural Networks, Optimizers, Recommendation Systems</code></pre>
