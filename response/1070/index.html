        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Towards Empathetic Conversational Recommender Systems
Abstract:
Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) are able to elicit user preferences through multi-turn dialogues. They typically incorporate external knowledge and pre-trained language models to capture the dialogue context. Most CRS approaches, trained on benchmark datasets, assume that the standard items and responses in these benchmarks are optimal. However, they overlook that users may express negative emotions with the standard items and may not feel emotionally engaged by the standard responses. This issue leads to a tendency to replicate the logic of recommenders in the dataset instead of aligning with user needs. To remedy this misalignment, we introduce empathy within a CRS. With empathy we refer to a system’s ability to capture and express emotions. We propose an empathetic conversational recommender (ECR) framework. ECR contains two main modules: emotion-aware item recommendation and emotion-aligned response generation. Specifically, we employ user emotions to refine user preference modeling for accurate recommendations. To generate human-like emotional responses, ECR applies retrieval-augmented prompts to fine-tune a pre-trained language model aligning with emotions and mitigating hallucination. To address the challenge of insufficient supervision labels, we enlarge our empathetic data using emotion labels annotated by large language models and emotional reviews collected from external resources. We propose novel evaluation metrics to capture user satisfaction in real-world CRS scenarios. Our experiments on the ReDial dataset validate the efficacy of our framework in enhancing recommendation accuracy and improving user satisfaction.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let&#39;s start by reading through both carefully.

The title is &#34;Towards Empathetic Conversational Recommender Systems.&#34; That gives me a good starting point—conversational recommender systems (CRS) and empathy are the main themes here.

Looking at the abstract, it mentions that CRSs use multi-turn dialogues to elicit user preferences. They incorporate external knowledge and pre-trained language models. The issue is that existing approaches don&#39;t account for negative emotions or emotional engagement from users. The article introduces an empathetic framework called ECR with two modules: emotion-aware item recommendation and emotion-aligned response generation.

So, breaking this down, the key elements are:

1. **Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS):** Clearly a main category here.
2. **Empathy:** This is a new angle introduced in the article.
3. **Emotion-Aware Recommendation:** Since they&#39;re using emotions to refine recommendations.
4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** They use language models, so this ties into NLP techniques.
5. **Multi-Turn Dialogues:** Important for understanding how interactions are structured.
6. **User Experience and Satisfaction:** The framework aims to improve these by considering emotions.
7. **Emotional Responses Generation:** This is a specific aspect of their approach.
8. **Human-Centered AI:** Since the focus is on aligning with user needs, this fits.
9. **Sentiment Analysis:** They talk about capturing user emotions, which relates to sentiment analysis.
10. **User Preference Modeling:** As they&#39;re refining models based on emotions.

I should also consider the evaluation metrics and real-world applications mentioned in the abstract. However, since the guidelines suggest sticking to 8-12 categories and avoiding too many, I&#39;ll focus on the most relevant ones.

Putting it all together, the categories should cover both the technical aspects (like NLP, emotion-aware recommendation) and the user-centric elements (empathy, user experience). Also, including broader areas like human-centered AI ties into the impact of the system.
&lt;/think&gt;
