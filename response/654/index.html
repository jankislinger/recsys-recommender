Title: Pessimistic Reward Models for Off-Policy Learning in Recommendation
Abstract:
Methods for bandit learning from user interactions often require a model of the reward a certain context-action pair will yield – for example, the probability of a click on a recommendation. This common machine learning task is highly non-trivial, as the data-generating process for contexts and actions is often skewed by the recommender system itself. Indeed, when the deployed recommendation policy at data collection time does not pick its actions uniformly-at-random, this leads to a selection bias that can impede effective reward modelling. This in turn makes off-policy learning – the typical setup in industry – particularly challenging.
In this work, we propose and validate a general pessimistic reward modelling approach for off-policy learning in recommendation. Bayesian uncertainty estimates allow us to express scepticism about our own reward model, which can in turn be used to generate a conservative decision rule. We show how it alleviates a well-known decision making phenomenon known as the Optimiser’s Curse, and draw parallels with existing work on pessimistic policy learning. Leveraging the available closed-form expressions for both the posterior mean and variance when a ridge regressor models the reward, we show how to apply pessimism effectively and efficiently to an off-policy recommendation use-case. Empirical observations in a wide range of environments show that being conservative in decision-making leads to a significant and robust increase in recommendation performance. The merits of our approach are most outspoken in realistic settings with limited logging randomisation, limited training samples, and larger action spaces.

Alright, so I need to categorize this research article about Pessimistic Reward Models for Off-Policy Learning in Recommendation. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I&#39;ll look at the title and abstract to understand what the article is about. The title mentions &#34;Pessimistic Reward Models&#34; and &#34;Off-Policy Learning.&#34; From my understanding, off-policy learning is a method used in reinforcement learning where we learn from data generated by a different policy than the one we&#39;re optimizing. This is common in recommendation systems because the system&#39;s actions (recommendations) influence the data it collects.

The abstract starts by talking about bandit learning and user interactions, which are definitely related to recommendation systems. It mentions that these methods require a reward model for context-action pairs, like click probabilities on recommendations. The problem arises when the data isn&#39;t collected uniformly at random because the recommender system itself influences what actions are taken, leading to selection bias. This makes off-policy learning challenging.

The authors propose a pessimistic approach using Bayesian uncertainty estimates to express skepticism about their reward models. They aim to create a conservative decision rule to avoid the Optimizer&#39;s Curse, which I remember is when an algorithm overestimates the value of an action because it selects based on maximum estimated values without considering uncertainty. This seems related to multi-armed bandits and policy learning.

They use ridge regression for modeling rewards and leverage closed-form expressions for posterior mean and variance. Empirical tests show that being conservative in decision-making improves recommendation performance, especially in realistic scenarios with limited data or large action spaces.

Now, I&#39;ll try to map this to the categories provided. Let me list out what seems relevant:

1. **Off-Policy Learning**: Clearly central to the article.
2. **Bandit Algorithms**: Since it&#39;s about bandit learning and multi-armed bandits are a type of recommendation approach.
3. **Reward Modeling**: The article focuses on modeling rewards accurately despite biases.
4. **Recommendation Systems**: Obviously, as this is about recommendations.
5. **Selection Bias**: Discussed in the context of non-uniform data collection.
6. **Uncertainty Estimation**: Using Bayesian methods to express uncertainty.
7. **Optimizers&#39; Curse**: A key concept addressed by their approach.
8. **Decision Making Under Uncertainty**: Since they&#39;re using conservative decision rules.
9. **Reinforcement Learning**: As off-policy learning is a part of RL.
10. **Bayesian Methods**: Used for uncertainty estimates.

I think these categories cover the main aspects of the article. I should ensure each category is clear and aligns with user interests, especially those in recommendation systems and machine learning.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, so I&#39;m trying to figure out how to categorize this research article about Pessimistic Reward Models for Off-Policy Learning in Recommendation. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Pessimistic Reward Models&#34; and it&#39;s focused on &#34;Off-Policy Learning in Recommendation.&#34; That gives me a hint that it&#39;s related to recommendation systems and bandit algorithms, which are used in reinforcement learning for making recommendations.

Looking at the abstract, the article talks about how methods for bandit learning require models to predict rewards based on context-action pairs. The challenge here is selection bias because the recommendation system itself influences the data collected. So when the deployed policy isn&#39;t randomizing actions uniformly, it causes a skew in the data, making off-policy learning tough.

The proposed solution is a pessimistic reward modeling approach using Bayesian uncertainty estimates to express skepticism about their own models. This leads to a conservative decision rule that helps alleviate the Optimizer&#39;s Curse. They use ridge regressors for modeling rewards and provide closed-form expressions for posterior mean and variance. The results show improved recommendation performance in various environments, especially under limited logging randomization and larger action spaces.

So, breaking this down, the key elements here are:

1. **Bandit Algorithms**: Since it&#39;s about off-policy learning in bandits.
2. **Recommendation Systems**: Clearly a focus area here.
3. **Off-Policy Learning**: The core of their approach.
4. **Selection Bias**: They address this issue in their method.
5. **Bayesian Methods**: Using Bayesian uncertainty estimates.
6. **Optimist&#39;s Curse**: This is a problem they solve with their pessimistic approach.
7. **Conservative Decision-Making**: Part of their solution strategy.
8. **Ridge Regression**: The specific model they use for rewards.

I should make sure these categories are relevant and cover all the main aspects discussed in the article. Each category needs to be clear and descriptive so users can easily navigate through related topics. Also, considering other examples provided, categories like &#34;Family of Algorithm&#34; and &#34;Domain of Problem&#34; seem appropriate here.
&lt;/think&gt;

The research article titled &#34;Pessimistic Reward Models for Off-Policy Learning in Recommendation&#34; is categorized as follows:

- Bandit Algorithms
- Recommendation Systems
- Off-Policy Learning
- Selection Bias
- Bayesian Methods
- Optimizer&#39;s Curse
- Conservative Decision-Making
- Ridge Regression</code></pre>
