Title: Pace My Race: Recommendations for Marathon Running
Abstract:
We propose marathon running as a novel domain for recommender systems and machine learning. Using high-resolution marathon performance data from multiple marathon races (n=7931), we build in-race recommendations for runners. We show that we can outperform the existing techniques which are currently employed for in-race finish-time prediction, and we demonstrate how such predictions may be used to make real time recommendations to runners. The recommendations are made at critical points in the race to provide personalised guidance so the runner can adjust their race strategy. Through the association of model features and the expert domain knowledge of marathon runners we generate explainable, adaptable pacing recommendations which can guide runners to their best possible finish time and help them avoid the potentially catastrophic effects of hitting the wall.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Pace My Race: Recommendations for Marathon Running.&#34; Let&#39;s start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions marathon running as a novel domain for recommender systems. So right away, I know that Recommender Systems is definitely one category. The abstract talks about using machine learning techniques in this context, so Machine Learning should be another category.

Looking at the problem domain, it&#39;s clearly related to Sports and Athletics since it&#39;s focused on marathon running. Health and Wellness also makes sense because it involves runner performance and health outcomes like avoiding hitting the wall.

The article discusses personalizing pacing strategies for runners, which falls under Personalization in recommendations. Real-time Recommendations are another key aspect because they provide guidance during the race.

The study uses high-resolution data from multiple races, indicating a focus on Data Analysis within the recommendation space. The abstract mentions outperforming existing techniques, so Technique Comparison should be included as well.

Since they&#39;re developing an application for runners, Real-World Applications is appropriate. They also discuss in-race finish-time prediction, which ties into Predictive Analytics.

Lastly, the recommendations are made at critical points to adapt strategies, so Adaptability is a relevant category here.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;Pace My Race: Recommendations for Marathon Running.&#34; Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The article introduces marathon running as a new domain for recommender systems. They used data from 7931 marathon runners to create in-race recommendations. Their method outperforms existing techniques and provides real-time advice at critical points, helping runners adjust their strategies. The recommendations are based on model features and expert knowledge, aiming to be explainable and adaptable. The goal is to help runners achieve better finish times and avoid hitting the wall.

Now, I need to assign this article to multiple relevant categories. Let me break it down:

1. **Family of Algorithm**: Since they&#39;re using machine learning for recommendations, but the abstract doesn&#39;t specify the exact algorithm. However, in recommendation systems, common families include Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization, etc. But since they mention real-time predictions and personalized guidance, maybe it&#39;s something like a session-based or time-aware model. Not entirely sure, so I&#39;ll note that.

2. **Domain of Problem**: Clearly, the domain is Sports/Health and Fitness, specifically Marathon Running.

3. **Recommendation Space Specifics**: The article focuses on in-race recommendations, which falls under Real-Time Recommendations. They also mention personalized pacing, so Personalized Recommendations makes sense.

4. **Evaluation Aspects**: They talk about performance metrics like finish time prediction accuracy, but they also emphasize the practical impact of avoiding hitting the wall and helping runners achieve their best times. This relates to both Performance Metrics and Impact Assessment in evaluation.

5. **Real-World Applications**: The system is applied in a real-world setting with actual marathon data, so Real World Applications. They might also be using A/B testing or user surveys for validation, but it&#39;s not explicitly stated, so I&#39;m less certain on that.

6. **Other Categories**: Since the recommendations are based on expert knowledge and aim to be explainable, Explanability is a good fit. Also, they mention helping runners avoid hitting the wall, which ties into Sports Medicine aspects.

Putting this together, possible categories could include:

- Domain: Sports/Health and Fitness
- Application: Real World Applications (maybe A/B Testing if used)
- Aspect: Personalized Recommendations, Real-Time Recommendations
- Evaluation: Performance Metrics, Impact Assessment
- Algorithm Family: Maybe Collaborative Filtering or something else, but not specified.
- Additional: Explanability, Sports Medicine

Wait, the guidelines mention categories like &#34;Real World Applications&#34; and &#34;A/B Test.&#34; Since it&#39;s not clear if A/B testing was used, maybe skip that. Instead, include Sports Medicine as a specific category.

So, finalizing the list:

1. **Sports/Health and Fitness**: Directly related to marathon running.
2. **Personalized Recommendations**: The recommendations are tailored to individual runners.
3. **Real-Time Recommendations**: The system provides advice during the race.
4. **In-Race Recommendations**: Specific to the event itself.
5. **Performance Metrics**: Evaluating based on finish times and accuracy.
6. **Impact Assessment**: Assessing how recommendations affect runner outcomes.
7. **Explanability**: Emphasizing understandable and adaptable pacing.
8. **Sports Medicine**: Relates to preventing physical issues like hitting the wall.

That gives me eight categories, which fits the requirement of 8-12. I think this covers both the content and user-centric design aspects effectively.
&lt;/think&gt;

Sports/Health and Fitness, Personalized Recommendations, Real-Time Recommendations, In-Race Recommendations, Performance Metrics, Impact Assessment, Explanability, Sports Medicine</code></pre>
