        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Investigating the effects of incremental training on neural ranking models
Abstract:
Recommender systems are an essential component of online systems, providing users with a personalized experience. Some recommendation scenarios such as social networks or news are very dynamic, with new items added continuously and the interest of users changing over time due to breaking news or popular events. Incremental training is a popular technique to keep recommender models up-to-date in those dynamic platforms. In this paper, we provide an empirical analysis of a large industry dataset from the Sharechat app MOJ, a social media platform for short videos, to answer relevant questions like – how often should I retrain the model? – do different models, features and dataset sizes benefit from incremental training? – Do all users and items benefit the same from incremental training?

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by understanding what the article is about.

The title is &#34;Investigating the effects of incremental training on neural ranking models.&#34; From that, I gather it&#39;s related to machine learning techniques, specifically neural networks, and how they&#39;re trained incrementally instead of from scratch each time.

Looking at the abstract, it talks about recommender systems in dynamic environments like social media or news platforms. They mention Sharechat app MOJ as a case study, which is a social media platform for short videos. The key points are:

- Recommender systems
- Dynamic environments with new items and changing user interests
- Incremental training to keep models updated
- Empirical analysis using large industry dataset

So the article discusses how incremental training affects neural ranking models in the context of recommendation systems, especially in fast-paced platforms where data changes frequently.

Now, I need to map this into relevant categories. Let me go through each guideline and example category:

1. **Family of Algorithm**: The paper talks about neural ranking models, which fall under machine learning. So &#34;Neural Networks&#34; is a good fit here.
2. **Domain of the Problem**: It&#39;s about recommendation systems applied in social media. So categories like &#34;Recommendation Systems,&#34; &#34;Social Media,&#34; and maybe &#34;Short Videos&#34; as that&#39;s specific to Sharechat.
3. **Specific Recommendation Aspects**: The paper deals with incremental training, so perhaps a category like &#34;Incremental Training.&#34; Also, since it looks at how often to retrain models, that relates to &#34;Model Update Frequency.&#34;
4. **Aspects of Evaluation**: They&#39;re analyzing different models and their benefits from incremental training, which touches on model evaluation. So &#34;Model Evaluation&#34; is relevant.
5. **Real-World Applications**: Since they used a real dataset from Sharechat, categories like &#34;Industry Dataset,&#34; &#34;A/B Testing&#34; (though I&#39;m not sure if A/B testing was mentioned), and maybe &#34;User Behavior Analysis&#34; since it&#39;s about how users&#39; interests change.

I should also consider other aspects like the dynamic nature of the data. Categories such as &#34;Dynamic Data,&#34; &#34;Online Learning,&#34; or even &#34;Scalability&#34; might fit because incremental training is a way to handle large, changing datasets efficiently without retraining everything each time.

Let me brainstorm some categories:

- Neural Networks
- Incremental Training
- Recommendation Systems
- Model Evaluation
- Dynamic Environments
- Social Media
- Online Learning
- Industry Dataset
- User Behavior Analysis
- Model Update Frequency

Wait, I think &#34;Dynamic Data&#34; is a better fit than &#34;Dynamic Environments.&#34; Also, &#34;Short Videos&#34; as a specific domain might be too narrow but relevant given the case study.

I need to ensure each category is clear and user-friendly. Let me cross-check:

Is &#34;Incremental Training&#34; a standard enough term? I think so, yes. &#34;Model Update Frequency&#34; could be another way to phrase how often models are retrained.

Considering all these points, here&#39;s my list of categories:

Neural Networks, Incremental Training, Recommendation Systems, Model Evaluation, Dynamic Data, Social Media, Online Learning, Industry Dataset, User Behavior Analysis, Short Videos
&lt;/think&gt;

Neural Networks, Incremental Training, Recommendation Systems, Model Evaluation, Dynamic Data, Social Media, Online Learning, Industry Dataset, User Behavior Analysis, Short Videos</code></pre>
