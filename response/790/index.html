Title: Measuring Commonality in Recommendation of Cultural Content: Recommender Systems to Enhance Cultural Citizenship
Abstract:
Recommender systems have become the dominant means of curating cultural content, significantly influencing the nature of individual cultural experience. While the majority of academic and industrial research on recommender systems optimizes for personalized user experience, this paradigm does not capture the ways that recommender systems impact cultural experience in the aggregate, across populations of users. Although existing novelty, diversity, and fairness studies probe how recommender systems relate to the broader social role of cultural content, they do not adequately center culture as a core concept and challenge. In this work, we introduce commonality as a new measure of recommender systems that reflects the degree to which recommendations familiarize a given user population with specified categories of cultural content. Our proposed commonality metric responds to a set of arguments developed through an interdisciplinary dialogue between researchers in computer science and the social sciences and humanities. With reference to principles underpinning non-profit, public service media (PSM) systems in democratic societies, we identify universality of address and content diversity in the service of strengthening cultural citizenship as particularly relevant goals for recommender systems delivering cultural content. Taking diversity in movie recommendation as a case study in enhancing pluralistic cultural experience, we empirically compare the performance of recommendation algorithms using commonality and existing utility, diversity, novelty, and fairness metrics. Our results demonstrate that commonality captures a property of system behavior complementary to existing metrics and suggest the need for alternative, non-personalized interventions in recommender systems oriented to strengthening cultural citizenship across populations of users. In this way, commonality contributes to a growing body of scholarship developing ‘public good’ rationales for digital media and machine learning systems.

Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about measuring commonality in recommendation systems for cultural content. Let me go through it step by step.

First, the title mentions &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; and &#34;Cultural Content,&#34; so that&#39;s a key point. The abstract talks about how recommender systems influence cultural experiences across populations, which suggests it&#39;s looking at societal impacts rather than just individual user experience. So categories like Recommender Systems and Cultural Recommendations seem obvious.

The article introduces a new metric called &#34;commonality.&#34; That term isn&#39;t standard in recommendation research, so I&#39;ll need to make sure that category is included. It also discusses how this metric relates to existing concepts like diversity and fairness, so those should be categories too.

Looking at the content, they mention interdisciplinary dialogue with social sciences and humanities, which implies a focus on societal implications. Therefore, Societal Implications makes sense as a category. They reference public service media (PSM) in democratic societies, aiming for cultural citizenship, so Public Service Media could be another relevant category.

The study uses movie recommendations as a case study, so including Movies as a domain is appropriate. The abstract also talks about evaluation aspects beyond just accuracy, touching on diversity and fairness metrics, which ties into Evaluation Metrics and maybe Beyond Accuracy.

Since they&#39;re proposing commonality as a new measure, that should be in Evaluation Metrics. Additionally, the focus on enhancing pluralistic cultural experiences points towards Cultural Diversity as another category.

I need to ensure I&#39;m hitting at least 8-12 categories without overlapping too much. Let me list them out:

- Recommender Systems (obvious)
- Cultural Recommendations (specific domain)
- Commonality (new metric introduced)
- Societal Implications (broader impact)
- Public Service Media (context of their study)
- Movies (case study)
- Evaluation Metrics (since they&#39;re introducing a new one and comparing with others)
- Diversity (existing concept related to commonality)
- Fairness (another existing evaluation aspect)
- Beyond Accuracy (emphasizing other aspects beyond traditional metrics)

Wait, that&#39;s 10 categories. I think I covered the main points from the abstract. Each category is relevant and aligns with user-centric needs, especially for those interested in recommendation systems&#39; societal impacts and new evaluation metrics.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommender Systems, Cultural Recommendations, Commonality, Societal Implications, Public Service Media, Movies, Evaluation Metrics, Diversity, Fairness, Beyond Accuracy</code></pre>

Okay, I&#39;m looking at this article titled &#34;Measuring Commonality in Recommendation of Cultural Content: Recommender Systems to Enhance Cultural Citizenship.&#34; The abstract talks about how recommender systems influence cultural experiences and introduces a new metric called commonality. It also discusses the impact on populations beyond just personalized user experience.

First, the main theme is clearly related to recommender systems, so that&#39;s a primary category. They&#39;re discussing cultural content specifically, like movies or books, so &#39;Cultural Content&#39; should be another category. The article introduces a new metric, commonality, which relates to how familiar users are with certain cultural categories. That makes me think of metrics in evaluation, so &#39;Evaluation Metrics&#39; is relevant here.

They mention collaboration between computer science and social sciences/humanities, indicating an interdisciplinary approach, so that&#39;s another category. Also, the focus on non-profit media and public service suggests a connection to public good, which ties into societal impact.

The abstract also touches on diversity in recommendations, which connects to &#39;Diversity of Recommendations.&#39; Additionally, they challenge traditional personalized approaches by suggesting non-personalized interventions, leading me to include &#39;Non-Personalized Recommendations.&#39;

Lastly, the discussion about cultural citizenship and pluralistic experiences points towards broader social aspects, so &#39;Social Impact&#39; is another fitting category.

I should make sure each category is clear and directly relates to the content. Also, since the guidelines suggest multiple categories, I&#39;m assigning eight here to meet the requirement.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommender Systems, Cultural Content, Evaluation Metrics, Interdisciplinary Collaboration, Commonality Metric, Public Good, Diversity of Recommendations, Non-Personalized Recommendations, Social Impact</code></pre>
