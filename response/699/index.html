Title: Sequence Adaptation via Reinforcement Learning in Recommender Systems
Abstract:
Accounting for the fact that users have different sequential patterns, the main drawback of state-of-the-art recommendation strategies is that a fixed sequence length of user-item interactions is required as input to train the models. This might limit the recommendation accuracy, as in practice users follow different trends on the sequential recommendations. Hence, baseline strategies might ignore important sequential interactions or add noise to the models with redundant interactions, depending on the variety of users’ sequential behaviours. To overcome this problem, in this study we propose the SAR model, which not only learns the sequential patterns but also adjusts the sequence length of user-item interactions in a personalized manner. We first design an actor-critic framework, where the RL agent tries to compute the optimal sequence length as an action, given the user’s state representation at a certain time step. In addition, we optimize a joint loss function to align the accuracy of the sequential recommendations with the expected cumulative rewards of the critic network, while at the same time we adapt the sequence length with the actor network in a personalized manner. Our experimental evaluation on four real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of our proposed model over several baseline approaches. Finally, we make our implementation publicly available at https://github.com/stefanosantaris/sar.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. The goal is to help users easily find the content they&#39;re interested in. Let me read through the information again.

The title is &#34;Sequence Adaptation via Reinforcement Learning in Recommender Systems.&#34; That tells me it&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically using reinforcement learning to adapt sequences. 

Looking at the abstract: They mention that current methods require a fixed sequence length of user-item interactions for training models. This can be limiting because users have different sequential behaviors. The authors propose the SAR model which adjusts the sequence length personalized for each user. They use an actor-critics framework with reinforcement learning, optimizing a joint loss function to balance recommendation accuracy and cumulative rewards.

So, the core themes are:
1. Recommender systems
2. Reinforcement Learning (since they&#39;re using RL to adjust sequences)
3. Sequence adaptation/personalization
4. Model optimization for better recommendations

Other points: They evaluated on real-world datasets and made their implementation public, so there&#39;s a practical application aspect.

Now, mapping this to possible categories:

- **Recommender Systems**: Directly mentioned in the title and abstract.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Central method used.
- **Sequence Modeling/Adaptation**: Focuses on adjusting sequences dynamically.
- **Personalization**: SAR model adapts sequence lengths per user.
- **Model Optimization**: They optimized a joint loss function.
- **Evaluation Methods**: They tested on real datasets, so evaluation is involved.
- **Practical Applications**: Implementation available publicly, indicating real-world application.

Additionally, the problem they&#39;re solving relates to improving recommendation accuracy by handling variable user behaviors. So categories like &#34;Recommendation Accuracy&#34; and &#34;Sequential Recommendations&#34; might fit. 

I should avoid making too many niche categories but ensure that each is relevant and useful for users looking into these areas. Maybe include broader categories like &#34;Machine Learning&#34; as well, since RL is a subset of ML.

Putting it all together, the categories could be:
Reinforcement Learning, Recommender Systems, Sequence Modeling, Personalization, Model Optimization, Recommendation Accuracy, Sequential Recommendations, Practical Applications, Evaluation Methods, Machine Learning

I think that covers the main aspects without being too granular. Each category should help users find the article if they&#39;re interested in any of these areas.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I need to categorize this research article about sequence adaptation via reinforcement learning in recommender systems. Let&#39;s break it down.

First, looking at the title: &#34;Sequence Adaptation via Reinforcement Learning in Recommender Systems.&#34; So, keywords here include Sequence Adaptation, Reinforcement Learning, and Recommender Systems.

The abstract talks about users having different sequential patterns and how current models require a fixed sequence length, which can be limiting. The proposed solution is the SAR model, using an actor-critic framework where the RL agent adjusts the sequence length based on user interactions. They also mention optimizing a joint loss function for recommendation accuracy and cumulative rewards.

So, categories to consider:

1. **Reinforcement Learning**: Since they use RL in their model.
2. **Sequence Models**: The article deals with sequences of user-item interactions.
3. **Adaptive Systems**: The SAR model adapts the sequence length dynamically.
4. **Personalization**: They adjust models based on individual users&#39; behaviors.
5. **Actor-Critic Framework**: This is a specific component they used in their approach.
6. **Recommendation Systems**: Core topic of the article.
7. **Dynamic Models**: Because the sequence length changes over time as per user behavior.
8. **Evaluation Metrics**: They mention optimizing for cumulative rewards and recommendation accuracy, which relates to evaluation aspects.

I think these cover both the specific techniques used (like reinforcement learning and actor-critic) and broader categories like personalization and dynamic models. Ensuring each category is relevant and useful for users looking into recommendation systems and machine learning techniques.
&lt;/think&gt;
