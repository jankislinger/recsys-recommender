        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Generative Next-Basket Recommendation
Abstract:
Next-basket Recommendation (NBR) refers to the task of predicting a set of items that a user will purchase in the next basket. However, most of existing works merely focus on the relevance between user preferences and predicted items, ignoring the essential relationships among items in the next basket, which often results in over-homogenization of items. In this work, we presents a novel Generative next-basket Recommendation model (GeRec), a new NBR paradigm that generates the recommended items one by one to form the next basket via an autoregressive decoder. This generative NBR paradigm contributes to capturing and considering item relationships inside each baskets in both training and serving. Moreover, we jointly consider user’s both item- and basket-level contextual information to better capture user’s multi-granularity preferences. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its content. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Generative Next-Basket Recommendation.&#34; So it&#39;s about recommendation systems specifically for predicting the next basket a user will purchase. The abstract mentions that existing works focus on relevance between user preferences and items but ignore relationships among items in the basket, leading to over-homogenization. They introduce GeRec, which generates recommendations one by one using an autoregressive decoder. This approach helps capture item relationships during training and serving. They also consider both item-level and basket-level context for multi-granularity preferences. The experiments are on real-world datasets.

Now, considering the guidelines: assign 8-12 categories that are user-friendly and cover the content accurately.

First category is obviously Recommendation Systems since it&#39;s about next-basket recommendations. Next, the approach uses a generative model, so Generative Models makes sense.

The problem domain is e-commerce because basket recommendation is common in online shopping contexts. The technique used is an autoregressive decoder, which falls under Autoregressive Techniques.

They focus on capturing item relationships, so Item Relationships should be a category. They also consider user&#39;s multi-granularity preferences at both item and basket levels, hence Multi-Granularity Preferences.

The model generates recommendations one by one, forming a basket, which ties into Basket Recommendations as a specific application within recommendation systems.

Since the experiments are on real-world datasets, it shows Real-World Applications. The approach improves upon existing methods by considering relationships that others ignore, so this is an Improvement over Existing Methods.

The work contributes to Next-Basket Prediction specifically, making that another category. They use contextual information at both item and basket levels, which points to Contextual Information.

Lastly, the approach allows capturing and considering item relationships within baskets during training and serving, highlighting Item Relationships in Baskets as a specific aspect.
&lt;/think&gt;
