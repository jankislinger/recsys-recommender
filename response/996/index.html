        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Learning From Negative User Feedback and Measuring Responsiveness for Sequential Recommenders
Abstract:
Sequential recommenders have been widely used in industry due to their strength in modeling user preferences. While these models excel at learning a user’s positive interests, less attention has been paid to learn from negative user feedback. Negative user feedback is an important lever of user control, and comes with an expectation that recommenders should respond quickly and reduce similar recommendations to the user. However, negative feedback signals are often ignored in the training objective of sequential recommenders, which primarily aim at predicting positive user interactions. In this work, we incorporate explicit and implicit negative user feedback into the training objective of sequential recommenders using a “not-to-recommend” loss function that optimizes for the log likelihood of not recommending items with negative feedback. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using live experiments on a large-scale industrial recommender system. Furthermore, we address a challenge in measuring recommender responsiveness to negative feedback by developing a counterfactual simulation framework to compare recommender responses between different user actions, showing improved responsiveness from the modeling change.

Alright, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. The goal is to make sure it&#39;s easily discoverable and navigable for users.

The title mentions &#34;Learning From Negative User Feedback&#34; and &#34;Sequential Recommenders.&#34; So right away, those are key points. Sequential recommenders relate to recommendation systems that consider the order of user interactions, like in a sequence. That makes me think of categories related to recommendation algorithms or systems.

Looking at the abstract, they talk about incorporating both explicit and implicit negative feedback into the training objective using a &#34;not-to-recommend&#34; loss function. This suggests it&#39;s about improving model performance by considering not just positive interactions but also negative ones. So categories like Negative Feedback, Model Training, Loss Functions come to mind.

They also mention live experiments on a large-scale industrial system, which indicates real-world applications and A/B testing. That points towards Real-World Applications and Evaluation Methods as relevant categories.

The abstract further discusses measuring responsiveness to negative feedback using a counterfactual simulation framework. This is about evaluation metrics beyond just accuracy, so aspects like Responsiveness, Beyond Accuracy, and Evaluation Metrics would be appropriate.

Additionally, since the article deals with recommendation systems in general, broader categories like Recommendation Systems are essential. They might also fall under Sequential Recommenders specifically, as that&#39;s a focus area.

I should ensure each category is both specific enough to capture the nuances but broad enough to fit within existing structures. I need at least 8-12 categories, so let me compile them:

1. Negative Feedback: Directly addresses the article&#39;s focus on handling negative user responses.
2. Sequential Recommenders: The type of recommendation system discussed.
3. Model Training: Involves modifying training objectives to include negative feedback.
4. Loss Functions: Uses a &#34;not-to-recommend&#34; loss function as mentioned.
5. User Feedback: Encompasses both positive and negative interactions.
6. Responsiveness: Evaluates how quickly recommenders adapt to feedback.
7. Real-World Applications: The application in an industrial setting.
8. Evaluation Methods: Discusses measuring effectiveness through experiments.
9. Beyond Accuracy: Focuses on more than just prediction accuracy, like responsiveness.
10. Recommendation Systems: The general category covering all recommendation topics.

I think these cover the main points without being too narrow or overlapping excessively. They should help users find the article when exploring different facets of recommendation systems and related areas.
&lt;/think&gt;
