        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Contextual User Browsing Bandits for Large-Scale Online Mobile Recommendation
Abstract:
Online recommendation services recommend multiple commodities to users. Nowadays, a considerable proportion of users visit e-commerce platforms by mobile devices. Due to the limited screen size of mobile devices, positions of items have a significant influence on clicks: 1) Higher positions lead to more clicks for one commodity. 2) The ‘pseudo-exposure’ issue: Only a few recommended items are shown at first glance and users need to slide the screen to browse other items. Therefore, some recommended items ranked behind are not viewed by users and it is not proper to treat this kind of items as negative samples. While many works model the online recommendation as contextual bandit problems, they rarely take the influence of positions into consideration and thus the estimation of the reward function may be biased. In this paper, we aim at addressing these two issues to improve the performance of online mobile recommendation. Our contributions are four-fold. First, since we concern the reward of a set of recommended items, we model the online recommendation as a contextual combinatorial bandit problem and define the reward of a recommended set. Second, we propose a novel contextual combinatorial bandit method called UBM-LinUCB to address two issues related to positions by adopting the User Browsing Model (UBM), a click model for web search. Third, we provide a formal regret analysis and prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret independent of the number of items. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on two real-world datasets by a novel unbiased estimator. An online experiment is also implemented in Taobao, one of the most popular e-commerce platforms in the world. Results on two CTR metrics show that our algorithm outperforms the other contextual bandit algorithms.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into relevant categories based on its content and title. The title is &#34;Contextual User Browsing Bandits for Large-Scale Online Mobile Recommendation,&#34; which immediately tells me it&#39;s about recommendation systems, specifically for mobile devices.

Looking at the abstract, the main issues addressed are the impact of item positions on clicks in mobile recommendations and the &#39;pseudo-exposure&#39; problem where items not viewed aren&#39;t treated as negative samples. The authors model this as a contextual combinatorial bandit problem and propose an algorithm called UBM-LinUCB. They also discuss regret analysis, evaluation with real-world datasets, and an online experiment on Taobao.

So breaking it down:

1. **Algorithm Family**: The paper uses a bandit approach, specifically contextual combinatorial bandits. So &#34;Multi-Armed Bandits&#34; is relevant.
2. **Domain/Problem Area**: It&#39;s about recommendations in e-commerce, particularly mobile. So categories like &#34;Mobile Recommendations,&#34; &#34;E-commerce,&#34; and maybe even &#34;Online Platforms.&#34;
3. **Recommendation Specifics**: The paper addresses cold start issues indirectly by handling exposed vs. unexposed items, so &#34;Cold Start&#34; is applicable. Also, it deals with click prediction, which ties into &#34;Click Prediction.&#34;
4. **Evaluation Aspects**: They discuss unbiased evaluation methods and metrics like CTR (Click-Through Rate), so categories like &#34;Beyond Accuracy,&#34; &#34;Unbiased Evaluation,&#34; and &#34;CTR Metrics.&#34;
5. **Real-World Applications**: They tested their algorithm on Taobao, an A/B test in a real-world setting, so &#34;A/B Test&#34; is relevant.
6. **Other Aspects**: The paper touches on user behavior modeling with the User Browsing Model (UBM), so &#34;User Modeling.&#34; It&#39;s also about large-scale applications, hence &#34;Scalability.&#34;
7. **General Areas**: Since it&#39;s a recommendation system, that&#39;s a primary category.

Putting this all together, I need to assign multiple categories ensuring coverage across algorithm type, problem domain, specific recommendation challenges, evaluation metrics, and real-world application.
&lt;/think&gt;
