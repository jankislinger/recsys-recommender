Title: Aligning Daily Activities with Personality: Towards A Recommender System for Improving Wellbeing
Abstract:
Recommender Systems have not been explored to a great extent for improving health and subjective wellbeing. Recent advances in mobile technologies and user modelling present the opportunity for delivering such systems, however the key issue is understanding the drivers of subjective wellbeing at an individual level. In this paper we propose a novel approach for deriving personalized activity recommendations to improve subjective wellbeing by maximizing the congruence between activities and personality traits. To evaluate the model, we leveraged a rich dataset collected in a smartphone study, which contains three weeks of daily activity probes, the Big-Five personality questionnaire and subjective wellbeing surveys. We show that the model correctly infers a range of activities that are ‘good’ or ‘bad’ (i.e. that are positively or negatively related to subjective wellbeing) for a given user and that the derived recommendations greatly match outcomes in the real-world. i&gt;Presentation: Monday Poster Lunch&lt;/i

Alright, let&#39;s tackle this categorization task step by step. I&#39;m looking at an article titled &#34;Aligning Daily Activities with Personality: Towards A Recommender System for Improving Wellbeing.&#34; The abstract mentions that it&#39;s about a recommender system aimed at improving health and subjective wellbeing. They use mobile technologies and user modeling to align activities with personality traits, using data from smartphone studies, personality questionnaires, and wellbeing surveys.

First, I&#39;ll identify the core themes. It&#39;s definitely in the realm of Recommender Systems since that&#39;s explicitly mentioned. The focus is on Personalization because they&#39;re tailoring recommendations based on individual personalities. So, those two categories are a given.

Next, the domain here isn&#39;t traditional like Movies or Books; it&#39;s more about Health and Wellness since the goal is to improve wellbeing. That adds another category. Personality Traits come into play as a key aspect of user modeling, so that&#39;s essential too.

The study uses datasets from smartphone interactions, which falls under Mobile Technologies. They also mention using surveys for evaluation, specifically Subjective Wellbeing Surveys, so that should be included as well. 

Looking at the methods, they&#39;re leveraging machine learning models to infer activity recommendations. So, Machine Learning is another category. The approach aligns activities with personality, which ties into Activity Recommendations.

The research contributes to User Modeling since it involves understanding individual traits and behaviors. The evaluation shows real-world applicability, suggesting there&#39;s a Real-World Application aspect here.

They talk about maximizing the congruence between activities and personalities, which relates to Psychological Constructs. Additionally, their approach is personalized at an individual level, so Individualization fits in.

I should make sure these categories cover both specific aspects like Personality Traits and broader areas like Recommender Systems. Each category should be relevant enough to help users find related content easily without being too narrow or too broad.

Alright, so I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. The title is &#34;Aligning Daily Activities with Personality: Towards A Recommender System for Improving Wellbeing.&#34; From that, it sounds like it&#39;s about recommender systems in the context of health and wellbeing.

Looking at the abstract, they talk about how recommender systems haven&#39;t been widely used to improve health and subjective wellbeing. They mention mobile technologies and user modeling as key areas. The approach involves maximizing the alignment between daily activities and personality traits to suggest personalized recommendations. They used a dataset from a smartphone study that includes activity data, Big Five personality traits, and wellbeing surveys.

So, first, I should identify the main themes here. It&#39;s definitely about recommender systems, so &#34;Recommender Systems&#34; is a primary category. The focus is on health and wellbeing, which seems specific, so maybe &#34;Health &amp; Wellbeing&#34; as another category.

They&#39;re looking at personality traits, specifically using the Big Five model. That points to &#34;Personality Analysis&#34; or something similar. Also, since they mention maximizing congruence between activities and traits, that&#39;s probably about personalization, so &#34;Personalized Recommendations.&#34;

The dataset is collected through mobile technology, which ties into &#34;Mobile Computing.&#34; The evaluation aspect also comes up, discussing how the model infers good or bad activities, so &#34;Evaluation Metrics&#34; might be relevant.

They&#39;re aiming to improve subjective wellbeing, which relates to user behavior and experience. So maybe &#34;User Behavior &amp; Experience.&#34;

Since they&#39;re using a smartphone dataset, it&#39;s likely part of a larger context of technology usage, but I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a more specific category for that. The approach involves understanding individual drivers of wellbeing, so perhaps something related to psychological aspects, like &#34;Psychology in Recommender Systems&#34; or &#34;User Psychology.&#34;

Wait, the user provided some examples of categories: Family of algorithm (like Matrix Factorization), Domain of problem (Books, Movies, Healthcare), specific recommendation aspects (Cold Start), evaluation aspects (Diversity of Recommendations), real-world applications (A/B Test, User Survey). 

In this case, the family of algorithms isn&#39;t specified, but since they&#39;re using personality traits and mobile data, maybe &#34;User Modeling&#34; or &#34;Personality-Based Recommenders.&#34; The domain is health and wellbeing, so that&#39;s a category. They&#39;re not focusing on cold start; instead, it&#39;s about aligning activities with personality.

Evaluation focuses on whether activities are good or bad for wellbeing, which relates to how effective the recommendations are. So perhaps &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; since it&#39;s about outcomes beyond just accuracy metrics.

They also mention real-world applications like user surveys and data collected from a smartphone study, so maybe include something like &#34;A/B Testing&#34; or &#34;User Surveys,&#34; but I&#39;m not sure if those were specific enough.

Another angle is that they&#39;re dealing with activities, which are more dynamic and can change based on the day. So maybe &#34;Dynamic Recommendations.&#34;

Putting it all together, considering the guidelines to assign at least 8-12 categories, I should list relevant ones without overcrowding any category. Let me see:

1. Recommender Systems
2. Health &amp; Wellbeing
3. Personality Analysis
4. Personalized Recommendations
5. Mobile Computing
6. Evaluation Metrics (specifically about effectiveness in improving wellbeing)
7. User Behavior &amp; Experience
8. Psychology in Recommender Systems (or maybe just &#34;Psychology&#34;)
9. User Modeling
10. Beyond Accuracy (evaluation aspect beyond traditional metrics)
11. Real-World Applications (since they used a smartphone study and real data)
12. Dynamic Recommendations

Wait, that&#39;s 12 categories, which meets the guideline. Let me check if any are redundant or too broad. &#34;Recommender Systems&#34; is too general, but necessary as a base category. &#34;Health &amp; Wellbeing&#34; is specific enough. &#34;Personality Analysis&#34; seems right because they focus on personality traits.

I think that&#39;s solid. I&#39;ll go with these categories.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommender Systems, Health &amp; Wellbeing, Personality Analysis, Personalized Recommendations, Mobile Computing, Evaluation Metrics, User Behavior &amp; Experience, Psychology, User Modeling, Beyond Accuracy, Real-World Applications, Dynamic Recommendations</code></pre>
