        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Fair Ranking Metrics
Abstract:
Information access systems such as search engines and recommender systems often display results in a sorted ranked list based on their relevance. Fairness of these ranked list has received attention as an important evaluation criteria along with traditional metrics such as utility or accuracy. Fairness broadly involves both provider and consumer side fairness at both group and individual levels. Several fair ranking metrics have been proposed to measure group fairness for providers based on various “sensitive attributes”. These metrics differ in their fairness goal, assumptions, and implementations. Although there are several fair ranking metrics to measure group fairness, multiple open challenges still exist in this area to consider.
In my thesis, I work on the area of fair ranking metrics for provider-side group fairness. I am interested in understanding the fairness concepts and practical applications of these metrics to identify their strength and limitations to aid the researchers and practitioner by pointing out the gaps. Moreover, I will contribute to this research area by focusing on some of the limitations like considering different browsing models and bias in relevance information.

Okay, so I need to categorize this article titled &#34;Fair Ranking Metrics&#34; based on its abstract. The goal is to assign it to multiple relevant categories for better discoverability. Let me read through the abstract carefully.

The title suggests it&#39;s about fairness in ranking metrics, which immediately makes me think of evaluation criteria and fairness in recommendation systems or search engines. The abstract mentions that these systems display results in ranked lists and that fairness has become an important metric alongside traditional ones like utility or accuracy.

So, I should consider categories related to fairness and evaluation. The article discusses both provider-side and consumer-side fairness at group and individual levels. This indicates it&#39;s about algorithmic fairness, so adding &#34;Algorithmic Fairness&#34; makes sense. It also talks about recommendation systems since that&#39;s a common application area for ranking metrics.

The abstract mentions several fair ranking metrics aimed at measuring group fairness for providers based on sensitive attributes. So categories like &#34;Group Fairness,&#34; &#34;Sensitive Attributes,&#34; and &#34;Provider-Side Fairness&#34; come to mind. These are specific aspects within the broader fairness topic.

Evaluation aspects are another key part, so including &#34;Evaluation Criteria&#34; is appropriate. The author&#39;s focus on understanding concepts and practical applications suggests a research methodology angle, hence &#34;Research Methodology.&#34; They also discuss challenges in areas like different browsing models and bias in relevance information, which points to specific application areas within ranking systems.

Additionally, the article addresses both theory and practice, so &#34;Theory and Practice&#34; is a good fit. Lastly, since it&#39;s about metrics used to evaluate fairness, adding &#34;Fairness Metrics&#34; as a category will help users find it easily.

Putting this all together, I&#39;ll list these categories ensuring they cover both broad and specific areas relevant to the article.
&lt;/think&gt;
