Title: History-Augmented Collaborative Filtering for Financial Recommendations
Abstract:
In many businesses, and particularly in finance, the behavior of a client might drastically change over time. It is consequently crucial for recommender systems used in such environments to be able to adapt to these changes. In this study, we propose a novel collaborative filtering algorithm that captures the temporal context of a user-item interaction through the users’ and items’ recent interaction histories to provide dynamic recommendations. The algorithm, designed with issues specific to the financial world in mind, uses a custom neural network architecture that tackles the non-stationarity of users’ and items’ behaviors. The performance and properties of the algorithm are monitored in a series of experiments on a G10 bond request for quotation proprietary database from BNP Paribas Corporate and Institutional Banking.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its content. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;History-Augmented Collaborative Filtering for Financial Recommendations.&#34; Hmm, so it&#39;s about a recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering but with some added history component. The focus seems to be on financial recommendations, which suggests it&#39;s tailored for applications in banking or finance.

Looking at the abstract, it mentions that client behavior can change drastically over time, especially in finance. Therefore, the recommender system needs to adapt. They propose a novel algorithm that captures temporal context using recent interaction histories of users and items. The algorithm uses a custom neural network architecture to handle non-stationarity, which I think refers to how user/item behaviors don&#39;t remain constant over time.

They tested this on a G10 bond database from BNP Paribas, which is a real-world application. So the article has practical implications in the financial domain.

Now, thinking about the categories. The first obvious one is the algorithm family. It&#39;s using collaborative filtering with some history augmentation, so maybe &#34;Collaborative Filtering&#34; as a primary category. Since it involves neural networks, perhaps &#34;Neural Networks&#34; should be another category.

The problem domain here is finance, specifically banking or financial recommendations. So categories like &#34;Finance,&#34; &#34;Banking,&#34; and &#34;Financial Recommendations&#34; make sense.

The abstract talks about handling changes over time, which relates to temporal aspects. So &#34;Temporal Context&#34; could be a relevant category. They&#39;re dealing with non-stationarity in behaviors, so maybe another category like that or something related to dynamic recommendations.

They mention experiments on a real dataset from BNP Paribas, indicating real-world application. That suggests categories such as &#34;Real-World Applications,&#34; &#34;Industry Applications,&#34; and perhaps &#34;A/B Testing&#34; if they ran any tests, though I don&#39;t see explicit mention of A/B testing here.

The system adapts to changing user behavior, so maybe a category like &#34;Adaptive Systems&#34; or &#34;Dynamic Adaptation.&#34; Also, since it&#39;s about financial products like bonds, including specific domains like &#34;Bonds&#34; could be useful for users interested in that area.

Looking at the guidelines, each article should go into 8-12 categories. I have:

1. Collaborative Filtering
2. Neural Networks
3. Finance
4. Banking
5. Financial Recommendations
6. Temporal Context
7. Non-stationarity
8. Real-World Applications
9. Industry Applications
10. Adaptive Systems

That&#39;s ten categories, which fits within the 8-12 range. I need to make sure these are clear and user-friendly. Maybe &#34;Non-stationarity&#34; could be phrased differently, but it accurately reflects the content.

I should also consider if any other specific aspects apply. The abstract mentions experiments on a bond database, so perhaps adding &#34;Bonds&#34; as another category would help users interested in that financial instrument find this article easily.

So, adding &#34;Bonds&#34; gives me an 11th category. That seems comprehensive without being too granular. Let me check if all these categories make sense and are user-centric. Users looking for finance-related recommendation systems or neural network applications in banking would likely search under these categories, making the interface more navigable.

I think this covers the key aspects of the article: algorithm type, problem domain, specific financial instruments, temporal handling, real-world testing, and system adaptability.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;History-Augmented Collaborative Filtering for Financial Recommendations.&#34; Let me read through it carefully.

The title mentions collaborative filtering and financial recommendations. The abstract talks about how user behavior changes over time in finance, which is important for recommender systems. They propose a new algorithm that uses recent interaction histories to adapt dynamically. It&#39;s tailored for the financial sector with a custom neural network to handle non-stationarity. They tested it on bond data from BNP Paribas.

So, starting with categories. The main method here is collaborative filtering, and they&#39;ve augmented it with history, so that&#39;s definitely one. It&#39;s in the finance domain, so &#34;Financial Recommendations&#34; fits. Since they&#39;re dealing with time-based changes in user behavior, temporal dynamics should be another category. They mention a custom neural network architecture, which relates to model design or neural networks.

Looking at aspects of recommendation space, cold start isn&#39;t directly mentioned, but it&#39;s about adapting to changing behaviors, so maybe not. Evaluation aspects like diversity aren&#39;t highlighted, but they did experiments on their own data, which is more about real-world application—so A/B Test or User Survey might fit if they tested with user feedback, but the abstract says they used a proprietary database without explicit mention of user surveys. Maybe stick to Real-World Applications as it was tested in a financial setting.

They also address non-stationarity, so that&#39;s another category. The dataset is specific to bonds and a financial institution, which ties into domain-specific datasets.

Putting it all together: Collaborative Filtering, Financial Recommendations, Temporal Dynamics, Neural Networks, Model Architecture, Non-Stationarity, Real-World Applications, Domain-Specific Datasets.
