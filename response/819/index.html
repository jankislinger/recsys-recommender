        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Evaluation Framework for Cold-Start Techniques in Large-Scale Production Settings
Abstract:
In recommender systems, cold-start issues are situations where no previous events (e.g., ratings), are known for certain users or items. Mitigating cold-start situations is a fundamental problem in almost any recommender system [3, 5]. In real-life, large-scale production systems, the challenge of optimizing the cold-start strategy is even greater. We present an end-to-end framework for evaluating and comparing different cold-start strategies. By applying this framework in Outbrain’s recommender system, we were able to reduce our cold-start costs by half, while supporting both offline and online settings. Our framework solves the pain of benchmarking numerous cold-start techniques using surrogate accuracy metrics on offline datasets - coupled with an extensive, cost-controlled online A/B test. In this abstract, We’ll start with a short introduction to the cold-start challenge in recommender systems. Next, we will explain the motivation for a framework for cold-start techniques. Lastly, we will then describe - step by step - how we used the framework to reduce our exploration by more than 50%.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about an evaluation framework for cold-start techniques in large-scale production settings. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract again.

The title mentions &#34;Evaluation Framework&#34; and &#34;Cold-Start Techniques,&#34; so that&#39;s a clear indicator of one category: Cold Start. The abstract goes into detail about how cold-start issues occur when there are no previous events for certain users or items, which is fundamental in recommender systems. So, Recommender Systems should definitely be another category.

The article talks about optimizing cold-start strategies in large-scale production settings, specifically mentioning Outbrain&#39;s system. This suggests that Large-Scale Production is relevant. They also mention reducing costs by half using an end-to-end framework, so Cost Optimization fits here too.

They implemented this framework in a real-world application, which ties into Real-World Applications and Case Studies. The abstract emphasizes the importance of evaluating cold-start techniques, pointing towards Evaluation Frameworks as another category.

The method used includes both offline datasets and online A/B tests. So, Offline vs Online is appropriate because it differentiates between testing environments. They also mention using surrogate accuracy metrics for benchmarking various techniques, which brings up Surrogate Metrics.

This framework helps in reducing exploration costs, so Optimization of Exploration is a key point. The study aims to improve recommendation strategies, indicating that it&#39;s about Recommendation Strategies.

Lastly, the approach involved an extensive online A/B test with controlled costs, which falls under Controlled Online Experiments. 

Putting this all together, I think these categories cover the article comprehensively without overlapping too much and ensure it&#39;s discoverable through various user interests.
&lt;/think&gt;

Cold Start, Recommender Systems, Evaluation Frameworks, Large-Scale Production, Real-World Applications, Case Studies, Cost Optimization, Offline vs Online, Surrogate Metrics, Optimization of Exploration, Recommendation Strategies, Controlled Online Experiments</code></pre>
