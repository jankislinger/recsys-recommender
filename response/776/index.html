Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.

Title: Modeling User Repeat Consumption Behavior for Online Novel Recommendation
Abstract:
Given a user’s historical interaction sequence, online novel recommendation suggests the next novel the user may be interested in. Online novel recommendation is important but underexplored. In this paper, we concentrate on recommending online novels to new users of an online novel reading platform, whose first visits to the platform occurred in the last seven days. We have two observations about online novel recommendation for new users. First, repeat novel consumption of new users is a common phenomenon. Second, interactions between users and novels are informative. To accurately predict whether a user will reconsume a novel, it is crucial to characterize each interaction at a fine-grained level. Based on these two observations, we propose a neural network for online novel recommendation, called NovelNet. NovelNet can recommend the next novel from both the user’s consumed novels and new novels simultaneously. Specifically, an interaction encoder is used to obtain accurate interaction representation considering fine-grained attributes of interaction, and a pointer network with a pointwise loss is incorporated into NovelNet to recommend previously-consumed novels. Moreover, an online novel recommendation dataset is built from a well-known online novel reading platform and is released for public use as a benchmark. Experimental results on the dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of NovelNet 1.

Okay, so I need to help categorize this research article about online novel recommendations for new users. Let&#39;s see what the title and abstract say.

The title mentions &#34;Modeling User Repeat Consumption Behavior&#34; which suggests it&#39;s looking at how users consume content again. So that makes me think of categories related to user behavior, maybe something like Repeat Consumption or Consumption Patterns.

Looking at the domain, it&#39;s about online novels, so I should categorize under Books. But since it&#39;s specifically for an online platform, maybe Online Platforms as well.

The paper is focused on new users who just joined in the last seven days. That sounds like a Cold Start problem because they have limited interaction history. So Cold Start should be one of the categories.

They talk about predicting whether a user will reconsume a novel, which involves recommendation accuracy and personalization. So categories like Recommendation Accuracy and Personalization could fit here.

The authors propose a neural network called NovelNet. Neural Networks is a broad category, but they also mention using an interaction encoder and a pointer network with pointwise loss. That&#39;s more specific, so I&#39;ll include Interaction Encoding and Pointer Network as separate categories.

They built a dataset from an online platform and released it as a benchmark. So Data Collection, Dataset Construction, and Benchmarking are relevant here.

The study involves experiments to test their model&#39;s effectiveness. Therefore, Experimental Analysis is another category.

Since the recommendation happens on an online platform, Web Systems makes sense too.

Putting it all together, I should list these categories ensuring each one accurately reflects a key aspect of the article without overlapping too much. Let me make sure they cover both specific and broader themes to help users find the article easily.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I&#39;m looking at this article about modeling user repeat consumption behavior for online novel recommendations. The title tells me it&#39;s focused on recommending novels to new users based on their interaction history.

First, the domain is clearly online novels, so that&#39;s a key category. They&#39;re dealing with new users who have only been visiting recently, so &#34;New Users&#34; makes sense as another category.

The paper talks about repeat consumption, which ties into user behavior patterns. That points me towards adding &#34;User Behavior Patterns.&#34; Since they&#39;re predicting whether a user will read again, it&#39;s about predicting repeat behaviors.

They mention using a neural network model called NovelNet, which is specific to online novels, so I&#39;ll include that under models. They also use an interaction encoder and pointer network with pointwise loss—those are specific techniques, so &#34;Neural Networks&#34; and maybe &#34;Interaction Encoder.&#34;

The dataset they built is from a known platform, and since it&#39;s used for benchmarking, &#34;Benchmark Dataset&#34; should be another category. The evaluation aspect is important, so I&#39;ll note that under Evaluation.

Since the focus is on repeat consumption, that&#39;s another direct category: &#34;Repeat Consumption.&#34; Additionally, recommendation systems in general apply here, so &#34;Recommendation Systems.&#34;

I think I&#39;ve covered all the aspects mentioned in the abstract and title, ensuring each category accurately reflects a key part of the article.
&lt;/think&gt;
