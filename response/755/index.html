        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Dynamic Global Sensitivity for Differentially Private Contextual Bandits
Abstract:
Bandit algorithms have become a reference solution for interactive recommendation. However, as such algorithms directly interact with users for improved recommendations, serious privacy concerns have been raised regarding its practical use. In this work, we propose a differentially private linear contextual bandit algorithm, via a tree-based mechanism to add Laplace or Gaussian noise to model parameters. Our key insight is that as the model converges during online update, the global sensitivity of its parameters shrinks over time (thus named dynamic global sensitivity). Compared with existing solutions, our dynamic global sensitivity analysis allows us to inject less noise to obtain (ϵ, δ)-differential privacy with added regret caused by noise injection in . We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis over the amount of noise added via dynamic global sensitivity and the corresponding upper regret bound of our proposed algorithm. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets confirmed the algorithm’s advantage against existing solutions.

Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about dynamic global sensitivity for differentially private contextual bandits. Let me break down what the article is about.

The title mentions &#34;Differentially Private Contextual Bandits,&#34; so that&#39;s a primary category right there. The abstract talks about bandit algorithms being used for interactive recommendations, which ties into recommendation systems. So I&#39;ll add that as another category.

Privacy concerns are central here, especially in the context of recommendation systems, so privacy is definitely relevant. They mention using Laplace or Gaussian noise with a tree-based mechanism, which relates to algorithm mechanisms and differential privacy techniques.

The article discusses online updates and how the model converges over time, leading me to think about online learning as another category. The analysis involves regret bounds and theoretical aspects, so both theoretical analysis and regret analysis should be included.

They tested their approach on synthetic and real-world datasets, which means they have experimental validation and empirical evaluation in their work. This also falls under evaluation metrics since they&#39;re measuring performance against existing solutions.

The fact that the algorithm dynamically adjusts its sensitivity over time points to dynamic adaptation. The context in contextual bandits implies a focus on context-aware recommendations.

So putting it all together, I&#39;ll categorize this article into the following areas: Differentially Private Contextual Bandits, Privacy, Recommendation Systems, Algorithm Mechanisms, Differential Privacy Techniques, Online Learning, Theoretical Analysis, Regret Analysis, Experimental Validation, Empirical Evaluation, Evaluation Metrics, and Dynamic Adaptation. Additionally, since it&#39;s about context-aware approaches, Context-Aware Recommendations should also be included.
&lt;/think&gt;
