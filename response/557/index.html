        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Towards Safety and Sustainability: Designing Local Recommendations for Post-pandemic World
Abstract:
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it paramount to maintain social distance to limit the viral transmission probability. At the same time, local businesses (e.g., restaurants, cafes, stores, malls) need to operate to ensure their economic sustainability. Considering the wide usage of local recommendation platforms like Google Local and Yelp by customers to choose local businesses, we propose to design local recommendation systems which can help in achieving both safety and sustainability goals. Our investigation of existing local recommendation systems shows that they can lead to overcrowding at some businesses compromising customer safety, and very low footfall at other places threatening their economic sustainability. On the other hand, naive ways of ensuring safety and sustainability can cause significant loss in recommendation utility for the customers. Thus, we formally express the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and solve by innovatively mapping it to a bipartite matching problem with polynomial time solutions. Extensive experiments over multiple real-world datasets reveal the efficacy of our approach along with the three-way control over sustainability, safety, and utility goals.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into 8-12 relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Towards Safety and Sustainability: Designing Local Recommendations for Post-pandemic World.&#34; The abstract mentions that COVID-19 has made social distancing important, but local businesses like restaurants and cafes need to stay open economically. They propose a recommendation system that helps achieve both safety and sustainability goals. 

They discuss existing systems causing overcrowding or low footfall, leading to issues with customer safety and economic sustainability. Their approach is multi-objective optimization mapped to a bipartite matching problem with polynomial solutions. They tested this using real-world datasets.

So the key themes here are recommendation systems, post-pandemic, local businesses, social distancing, economic sustainability, multi-objective optimization, bipartite matching, and experiments on real data.

I should map these into categories:

1. Recommendation Systems - obvious from title.
2. Local Recommendations - since it&#39;s about local businesses.
3. Social Distancing - a key factor addressed.
4. Economic Sustainability - ensuring businesses survive.
5. Post-pandemic World - context of COVID-19.
6. Multi-objective Optimization - the approach used.
7. Bipartite Matching - technique applied.
8. Real-world Applications - experiments with real data.
9. Business Management - relates to managing local businesses.
10. Crowd Control - dealing with overcrowding as a safety issue.
11. Sustainability - more general than economic, but relevant.

I think that&#39;s 11 categories. Maybe I can include one more if needed, like System Design or something related, but the list seems comprehensive enough.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommendation Systems, Local Recommendations, Social Distancing, Economic Sustainability, Post-pandemic World, Multi-objective Optimization, Bipartite Matching, Real-world Applications, Business Management, Crowd Control, Sustainability</code></pre>
