Title: Towards Psychologically Grounded Dynamic Preference Models
Abstract:
Designing recommendation systems that serve content aligned with time varying preferences requires proper accounting of the feedback effects of recommendations on human behavior and psychological condition. We argue that modeling the influence of recommendations on people’s preferences must be grounded in psychologically plausible models. We contribute a methodology for developing grounded dynamic preference models. We demonstrate this method with models that capture three classic effects from the psychology literature: Mere-Exposure, Operant Conditioning, and Hedonic Adaptation. We conduct simulation-based studies to show that the psychological models manifest distinct behaviors that can inform system design. Our study has two direct implications for dynamic user modeling in recommendation systems. First, the methodology we outline is broadly applicable for psychologically grounding dynamic preference models. It allows us to critique recent contributions based on their limited discussion of psychological foundation and their implausible predictions. Second, we discuss implications of dynamic preference models for recommendation systems evaluation and design. In an example, we show that engagement and diversity metrics may be unable to capture desirable recommendation system performance.

Alright, let me try to figure out how to categorize this article. The title is &#34;Towards Psychologically Grounded Dynamic Preference Models,&#34; which suggests it&#39;s about recommendation systems and psychology. The abstract mentions feedback effects of recommendations on human behavior and psychological conditions, so that&#39;s a key point.

They talk about modeling the influence of recommendations on people’s preferences using psychologically plausible models. They use three classic psychological effects: Mere-Exposure, Operant Conditioning, and Hedonic Adaptation. So these are specific concepts from psychology that should be included as categories.

The article contributes a methodology for developing these grounded dynamic preference models. It also mentions simulation-based studies to show how the psychological models can inform system design. This means it&#39;s not just theoretical but has practical applications in designing recommendation systems.

The implications discussed include evaluation metrics like engagement and diversity, which are important aspects of recommendation systems. They argue that traditional metrics might not capture performance well when using dynamic preference models.

So, for categorization, I should cover the main areas: recommendation systems, psychology, user modeling, feedback effects, simulation studies. Also, specific psychological terms like Mere-Exposure and Operant Conditioning are important. The methodology part can be another category. Evaluation aspects like engagement and diversity metrics also need to be included.

I think including &#34;Psychological Models&#34; as a main category makes sense since that&#39;s central to the article. &#34;Dynamic User Modeling&#34; is another key area because it&#39;s about how preferences change over time.

Putting this together, I&#39;ll list these categories making sure each relevant aspect is covered. Also, considering the guidelines, each category should be clear and help users find related articles easily.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about psychodynamically grounded preference models in recommendation systems. The title is &#34;Towards Psychologically Grounded Dynamic Preference Models,&#34; which immediately tells me the focus is on psychology and dynamic preferences.

Looking at the abstract, it talks about designing recommendation systems that adapt to time-varying user preferences. It mentions feedback effects of recommendations on human behavior and psychological conditions. So, this ties into how users interact with推荐系统 over time and how their preferences change based on what they&#39;re recommended.

The article specifically references three psychological effects: Mere-Exposure, Operant Conditioning, and Hedonic Adaptation. These are all well-known concepts in psychology, so the paper is definitely grounding its models in psychological theory. That makes me think about categories related to user modeling that incorporate psychological aspects or behavioral insights.

They also mention conducting simulation-based studies to show how these psychological models behave differently. So simulations are part of their methodology, which might be a category like Simulation-Based Studies or something similar.

The abstract notes implications for dynamic user modeling in recommendation systems, evaluation metrics, and system design. They point out that traditional engagement and diversity metrics might not capture all desirable performance aspects. This suggests the paper is discussing evaluation methods and possibly critiquing existing approaches.

Additionally, the article proposes a methodology for developing grounded models, which could be useful for other researchers. This indicates it&#39;s contributing to the field of user modeling and recommendation systems, making me think about categories like User Modeling, Recommendation Systems, and maybe even Evaluation Metrics.

Since they&#39;re talking about dynamic preferences, that implies time-varying or changing user interests over time, so Dynamic Preferences is a relevant category.

Putting this all together, I should come up with 8-12 categories. Let&#39;s list them:

1. **Psychological Modeling**: Because the paper grounds its models in psychology.
2. **Dynamic Preferences**: As the title suggests, preferences change over time.
3. **User Behavior**: Since it&#39;s about how recommendations affect user behavior.
4. **Recommendation Systems**: Core topic area.
5. **Feedback Effects**: The influence of recommendations on users.
6. **Simulation-Based Studies**: They used simulations to test their models.
7. **Evaluation Metrics**: They discuss the limitations of current metrics like engagement and diversity.
8. **User Modeling**: The paper contributes to how we model users dynamically.

I think that&#39;s a solid set, but maybe I can add more specific ones. For example, since they reference specific psychological concepts like Mere-Exposure, maybe there&#39;s a category for those. But the guidelines mention using broader categories if possible. So perhaps sticking with Psychological Modeling is better than listing each effect separately.

Another point: the paper discusses implications for system design and evaluation, so System Design and Evaluation could be separate categories. That would make sense.

So adding those, I now have:

1. Psychological Modeling
2. Dynamic Preferences
3. User Behavior
4. Recommendation Systems
5. Feedback Effects
6. Simulation-Based Studies
7. Evaluation Metrics
8. System Design
9. User Modeling

Hmm, that&#39;s nine categories. Maybe a few more? Let me think about the content again.

They talk about methodology for developing models, which is part of User Modeling and contributes to the field of Recommendation Systems. They also discuss real-world applications or implications, perhaps in terms of practical system design. Since they mention diversity and engagement metrics not being sufficient, that&#39;s related to Evaluation Metrics but maybe there&#39;s another angle like Beyond Accuracy in evaluation.

Wait, looking back at the examples provided, one category was &#34;Beyond Accuracy,&#34; which is part of evaluation aspects beyond traditional metrics. So yes, I can include that as a separate category.

Also, the paper is about modeling human behavior and psychological effects, so Behavioral Insights might be another category.

So adding Beyond Accuracy and Behavioral Insights brings it to eleven categories. Let me see:

1. Psychological Modeling
2. Dynamic Preferences
3. User Behavior
4. Recommendation Systems
5. Feedback Effects
6. Simulation-Based Studies
7. Evaluation Metrics
8. System Design
9. User Modeling
10. Beyond Accuracy
11. Behavioral Insights

That&#39;s eleven, but I could go up to twelve if necessary. Maybe also include something about the methodology they used or the specific psychological theories applied. But &#34;Psychological Modeling&#34; already covers that.

I think these categories should make the article discoverable for users interested in how psychology affects recommendation systems, dynamic user preferences, system design considerations, and evaluation beyond traditional metrics.
&lt;/think&gt;

The research article is categorized into the following 12 relevant categories to enhance discoverability and align with user interests:

1. Psychological Modeling
2. Dynamic Preferences
3. User Behavior
4. Recommendation Systems
5. Feedback Effects
6. Simulation-Based Studies
7. Evaluation Metrics
8. System Design
9. User Modeling
10. Beyond Accuracy
11. Behavioral Insights
12. Grounded Theory

These categories ensure the article is accessible to users exploring psychological influences, dynamic user modeling, and evaluation in recommendation systems.</code></pre>
