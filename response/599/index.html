Title: Recommender-Systems.com: A Central Platform for the Recommender-System Community
Abstract:
We introduce Recommender-Systems.com (RS_c) as a central platform for the recommender-systems community. RS_c provides regular news on important events in the community as well as curated lists of recommender-system resources including datasets, algorithms, jobs, software, and learning materials. Based on a survey with 28 participants – mostly authors at the RecSys 2019 conference – 91% agree that RS_c could be a major contribution to the community. Participants consider it currently particularly difficult to find best practice guidelines (45%); researchers, freelancers and employers (45%); and curated lists of state-of-the-art algorithms, software, and datasets (36%). Notably, only 19% consider it (very) easy to find material relating to diversity, equality and anti-discrimination.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Alright, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about Recommender-Systems.com. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Recommender-Systems. com: A Central Platform for the Recommender-System Community.&#34; So it&#39;s introducing a platform that serves as a hub for the recommender systems community. That gives me an idea that this article might be about community resources, platforms, or maybe even community building in the field of recommendation systems.

Looking at the abstract, they mention that RS_c provides news, curated lists of resources like datasets, algorithms, jobs, software, and learning materials. They also conducted a survey with 28 participants from RecSys 2019. The findings highlight that finding best practices, researchers/jobs, and state-of-the-art resources is difficult for many. Also, there&#39;s a notable challenge in finding material related to diversity, equality, and anti-discrimination.

So, breaking this down, the article discusses a platform aimed at centralizing information for the recommender systems community. It&#39;s about resource curation, which could relate to datasets or algorithms. The survey part might touch on community needs or challenges, so maybe categories like Community Needs, Challenges in Recommendation.

The fact that it&#39;s targeting researchers, freelancers, and employers suggests an aspect of job market or career resources within the recommendation field. Also, the emphasis on diversity and equality points towards ethical considerations or anti-discrimination measures in recommendations.

Given all this, I need to assign multiple categories. Let me think about each guideline:

1. **Categorization Accuracy**: The article is about a community platform providing resources, so categories like Community Resources, Resource Curation make sense. It&#39;s also about the challenges faced by the community, so maybe Challenges in Recommendation.

2. **Category Utility**: These categories should be broad enough to include other articles but specific enough to be useful. For example, Platform Development is specific but could cover similar studies on platforms for recommendation systems.

3. **User-Centric Design**: Users looking for resources or surveys about the community would find these categories helpful.

4. **Consistency**: Using terms like Community Needs and Job Market keeps it consistent with other potential articles in similar areas.

Other possible categories include Dataset Curation, Algorithm Repository since the platform provides curated lists of those. The survey aspect points to User Surveys as a category.

Additionally, considering diversity aspects, Anti-Discrimination is relevant. It&#39;s also about improving the community&#39;s access to resources, so maybe Community Development or something similar.

I need to make sure each article goes into at least 8-12 categories. Let me list possible ones:

- Recommender Systems (general category)
- Community Resources
- Resource Curation
- Dataset Curation
- Algorithm Repository
- Platform Development
- Community Needs
- Challenges in Recommendation
- User Surveys
- Job Market
- Anti-Discrimination
- Ethical Considerations

Wait, some of these might overlap. For example, &#34;Ethical Considerations&#34; and &#34;Anti-Discrimination&#34; are related but distinct enough to be separate categories.

Alternatively, considering the guidelines, it&#39;s better to have specific categories that accurately reflect the content without being too vague or overlapping excessively.

So, finalizing the list:

1. Recommender Systems (as a general category)
2. Community Resources
3. Resource Curation
4. Dataset Curation
5. Algorithm Repository
6. Platform Development
7. Community Needs
8. Challenges in Recommendation
9. User Surveys
10. Job Market
11. Anti-Discrimination

That&#39;s 11 categories, which fits within the 8-12 range.

I think these cover the main aspects of the article: it&#39;s about a platform (Platform Development) that curates resources (Resource Curation, Dataset Curation, Algorithm Repository), addresses community needs and challenges, includes a user survey (User Surveys), touches on job-related information (Job Market), and emphasizes ethical aspects like anti-discrimination.

I should also consider whether &#34;Ethical Considerations&#34; is necessary. Since the article mentions difficulty in finding diversity materials, but it&#39;s more about availability rather than ethics per se. So maybe Anti-Discrimination is sufficient without needing a broader category unless other articles fall under Ethical Considerations as well.

So, I&#39;ll stick with Anti-Discrimination for now.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this article titled &#34;Recommender-Systems.com: A Central Platform for the Recommender-System Community&#34;. The abstract talks about a new platform called RS_c that serves as a central hub for the recommender-system community. It provides news, curated lists of resources like datasets, algorithms, jobs, software, and learning materials. They surveyed 28 participants, mostly from RecSys 2019, and found that 91% agreed it could be a major contribution. The main issues they identified were difficulty in finding best practices (45%), researchers, freelancers, employers (another 45%), and state-of-the-art resources (36%). Interestingly, only 19% found materials related to diversity, equality, and anti-discrimination easy to find.

Alright, so the core themes here are the creation of a platform for the recommender system community. It&#39;s about resources, curation, and community support. The challenges addressed include difficulty in finding certain types of information. 

Looking at the categories I need to assign: first, family of algorithms isn&#39;t directly mentioned, but maybe something related? Or perhaps it&#39;s more about infrastructure or platforms. Maybe &#34;Platform&#34; is a category. Since it&#39;s about resources, that could be another category.

Domain-wise, it&#39;s about recommender systems in general, so probably the domain is Recommender Systems. The problem is about community support and resource curation, so maybe something like Community Resource Curation? 

In the recommendation space, the article discusses challenges with finding best practices, diversity, equality, etc., which are specific aspects of the field. So categories like Best Practices, Diversity, Equality, Anti-Discrimination come into play.

Evaluation aspects might not be directly discussed, but perhaps the platform&#39;s effectiveness is an evaluation point. Or maybe not—evaluation here seems more about user feedback on ease of finding resources.

Real-world applications: They mention A/B testing or user surveys? Not exactly, but the platform itself could be seen as a real-world application supporting researchers and practitioners.

Other relevant categories might include Community Support, Resource Repository, Survey-Based Insights since they conducted a survey to inform the platform&#39;s features.

I should make sure each category is clear and descriptive. Also, I need at least 8-12 categories. Let me list them:

1. Recommender Systems - obvious domain.
2. Platform - as it&#39;s about building a central platform.
3. Resource Curation - curating datasets, algorithms, etc.
4. Community Support - serving the community needs.
5. Best Practices - identified as a key challenge.
6. Diversity - difficulty in finding materials here.
7. Equality - same as above.
8. Anti-Discrimination - same theme.
9. Survey-Based Insights - using survey data to inform platform features.
10. Real-World Applications - the platform is a tool used in real applications by researchers and practitioners.

Wait, that&#39;s 10 categories. Maybe I can add more from other aspects like &#34;Community News&#34; since they provide regular news, or &#34;Learning Materials&#34; as part of resources. Or maybe &#34;Job Listings&#34; as another specific resource category. But the guidelines say each article should go into at least 8-12 categories, so adding a few more:

11. Job Listings
12. Learning Materials

But looking back, I think the initial list is sufficient and covers the main points without overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps &#34;Infrastructure&#34; as another category since it&#39;s about building an infrastructure for the community.

Alternatively, considering the challenges they faced, maybe &#34;User Needs Analysis&#34; as a category because they conducted a survey to understand user needs.

So revising, adding:

13. User Needs Analysis

Now I have 13 categories. Let me review them again:

- Recommender Systems
- Platform
- Resource Curation
- Community Support
- Best Practices
- Diversity
- Equality
- Anti-Discrimination
- Survey-Based Insights
- Real-World Applications
- Job Listings
- Learning Materials
- User Needs Analysis

That seems comprehensive. Each category is relevant and covers different aspects of the article, from the platform itself to the community needs it addresses.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommender Systems, Platform, Resource Curation, Community Support, Best Practices, Diversity, Equality, Anti-Discrimination, Survey-Based Insights, Real-World Applications, Job Listings, Learning Materials, User Needs Analysis</code></pre>
