Title: AutoOpt: Automatic Hyperparameter Scheduling and Optimization for Deep Click-through Rate Prediction
Abstract:
Click-through Rate (CTR) prediction is essential for commercial recommender systems. Recently, to improve the prediction accuracy, plenty of deep learning-based CTR models have been proposed, which are sensitive to hyperparameters and difficult to optimize well. General hyperparameter optimization methods fix these hyperparameters across the entire model training and repeat them multiple times. This trial-and-error process not only leads to suboptimal performance but also requires non-trivial computation efforts. In this paper, we propose an automatic hyperparameters scheduling and optimization method for deep CTR models, \emph{AutoOpt}, making the optimization process more stable and efficient. Specifically, the whole training regime is firstly divided into several consecutive stages, where a data-efficient model is learned to model the relation between model states and prediction performance. To optimize the stage-wise hyperparameters, AutoOpt uses the \textit{global} and \textit{local} scheduling modules to propose proper hyperparameters for the next stage based on the training in the current stage. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks are conducted to validate the effectiveness of AutoOpt. Moreover, AutoOpt has been deployed onto an advertising platform and a music platform, where online A/B tests also demonstrate superior improvement.

Alright, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about AutoOpt. The title mentions automatic hyperparameter scheduling for deep click-through rate prediction. So, first off, it&#39;s definitely related to Recommendation Systems because CTR prediction is a key part of those systems.

The abstract talks about using deep learning models for CTR, so Deep Learning is another category. Hyperparameters are a big deal in machine learning optimization, so Hyperparameter Optimization fits here. They also mention scheduling modules that adjust hyperparameters across training stages, which sounds like AutoML because it&#39;s automating parts of the model development process.

They tested their method on public benchmarks and deployed it on advertising and music platforms with A/B tests. That points to Real-World Applications and Industry Applications as relevant categories. The use of metrics beyond just accuracy in evaluations ties into Beyond Accuracy, focusing on other performance aspects.

The problem domain here is Web Systems since it&#39;s about online recommendations and广告 systems. They address challenges in optimizing deep models, so Deep Learning Challenges makes sense. Lastly, the improvement through A/B testing highlights User Behavior because understanding how users interact (click or not) is crucial for CTR prediction.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through the information provided.

The title is &#34;AutoOpt: Automatic Hyperparameter Scheduling and Optimization for Deep Click-through Rate Prediction.&#34; From the title, it&#39;s clear that the focus is on optimizing hyperparameters in deep learning models used for click-through rate prediction, which falls under recommendation systems. 

Looking at the abstract, the article discusses how deep learning-based CTR models are sensitive to hyperparameters and challenging to optimize effectively. Traditional methods fix hyperparameters throughout training, leading to suboptimal results and high computational costs. The authors propose a method called AutoOpt, which automates hyperparameter scheduling and optimization, aiming for a more stable and efficient process.

They mention that their approach divides the training into stages, using modules to propose hyperparameters for the next stage based on current training performance. They also conducted experiments on public benchmarks and deployed it in advertising and music platforms with positive results from A/B tests.

So, breaking this down:

1. **Family of Algorithm**: The paper deals with optimization methods, specifically hyperparameter tuning. It&#39;s related to deep learning models but focuses on the optimization aspect, so maybe &#34;Hyperparameter Optimization&#34; is a good category here.

2. **Domain of Problem**: Click-through rate prediction is crucial in recommendation systems, particularly for commercial applications like advertising and music platforms. So categories could include &#34;Recommendation Systems,&#34; &#34;CTR Prediction,&#34; and perhaps even more specific like &#34;Commercial Recommender Systems.&#34;

3. **Specific Aspect in Recommendation Space**: The paper addresses hyperparameter scheduling and optimization, which is a specific challenge in the field. Another aspect is the use of automatic methods, so maybe &#34;Automatic Optimization&#34; or &#34;Hyperparameter Tuning.&#34;

4. **Evaluation Aspects**: They mention conducting extensive experiments on benchmarks and deploying it with A/B testing. So categories like &#34;Experiments,&#34; &#34;A/B Testing,&#34; and &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; might be relevant.

5. **Applications**: The deployment in advertising and music platforms indicates real-world applications, so adding those as categories makes sense.

6. **Other Relevant Categories**: Since the focus is on optimization and efficiency, perhaps &#34;Efficient Training&#34; or &#34;Scalability&#34; could also apply, depending on how AutoOpt improves performance.

Now, considering all these points, I need to assign at least 8-12 categories. Let me list possible options:

- Hyperparameter Optimization
- Deep Learning
- Click-through Rate Prediction
- Recommendation Systems
- Commercial Applications
- A/B Testing
- Real-World Applications
- Experiments
- Automatic Optimization
- Scalability
- Efficiency
- Training Methods

Wait, maybe some of these are too broad. Let me refine them based on the examples given and ensure they align with user-centric design.

I think focusing on categories that clearly reflect the specific contributions and areas covered in the article would be best. So, perhaps:

1. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Directly related to their method.
2. **Deep Learning Models**: Since it&#39;s about deep CTR models.
3. **Click-through Rate Prediction**: Core topic of the research.
4. **Recommendation Systems**: As CTR prediction is a key part of recommendations.
5. **Commercial Recommender Systems**: Because they mention deployment in advertising and music platforms, which are commercial.
6. **A/B Testing**: They used A/B tests to validate their approach.
7. **Real-World Applications**: Indicates practical deployment beyond just experiments.
8. **Efficiency**: Their method aims for efficient training processes.
9. **Scalability**: Improving the optimization process likely makes it scalable.

I can also include &#34;Automatic Optimization&#34; and perhaps &#34;Optimization Methods,&#34; but maybe that&#39;s redundant with hyperparameter optimization. Maybe instead, I should consider if there are other specific aspects like &#34;Stage-wise Training&#34; or &#34;Data-efficient Models,&#34; but those might be too detailed.

Considering the example categories given earlier, such as &#34;Cold Start&#34; for specific recommendation challenges, this article doesn&#39;t cover that, so focusing on what&#39;s present is better.

I think that&#39;s a solid list of 9 categories. To reach 12, perhaps I can add more specific terms like &#34;Deep Neural Networks,&#34; &#34;Optimization Techniques,&#34; or &#34;Training Dynamics.&#34; But maybe it&#39;s better to keep them as relevant without being too vague.

So, finalizing the list, ensuring each category is clear and directly related:
&lt;/think&gt;

Hyperparameter Optimization, Deep Learning, Click-through Rate Prediction, Recommendation Systems, Commercial Applications, A/B Testing, Real-World Applications, Experiments, Automatic Optimization, Scalability, Efficiency, Training Methods</code></pre>
