Title: Learning to Ride a Buy-Cycle: A Hyper-Convolutional Model for Next Basket Repurchase Recommendation
Abstract:
The problem of Next Basket Recommendation (NBR) addresses the challenge of recommending items for the next basket of a user, based on her sequence of prior baskets. In this paper, we focus on a variation of this problem in which we aim to predict repurchases, i.e. we wish to recommend a user only items she had purchased before. We coin this problem Next Basket Repurchase Recommendation (NBRR). Over the years, a variety of models have been proposed to address the problem of NBR, however, the problem of NBRR has been overlooked. Although being highly related problems, which are often solved by the same methods, the problem of repurchase recommendation calls for a different approach. In this paper, we share insights from our experience of facing the challenge of NBRR. In light of these insights, we propose a novel hyper-convolutional model to leverage the behavioral patterns of repeated purchases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on three publicly available datasets, where it is shown to outperform other existing methods across multiple metrics.

Okay, I&#39;m trying to figure out how to categorize this research article titled &#34;Learning to Ride a Buy-Cycle: A Hyper-Convolutional Model for Next Basket Repurchase Recommendation.&#34; The goal is to assign it to 8-12 relevant categories so that users can easily find and explore related content. 

First, I&#39;ll read the title and abstract carefully. The paper is about next basket repurchase recommendation, which is a specific type of recommendation system where the focus is on suggesting items the user has bought before for their next purchase. This seems different from general recommendations but still falls under recommendation systems.

The authors mention that while there are models for Next Basket Recommendation (NBR), the repurchase aspect hasn&#39;t been as explored. They introduce a hyper-convolutional model to tackle this, which is a type of neural network approach. So, I should note that it involves deep learning and specifically convolutional networks or hyper-convolutional techniques.

Looking at the categories provided in the example, some relevant ones might be &#34;Recommendation Systems,&#34; since it&#39;s about recommending products. Then, more specific subcategories like &#34;Next Basket Recommendation&#34; and &#34;Repurchase Recommendation&#34; make sense because they are specialized areas within recommendation systems.

The model uses hyper-convolutional architecture, so adding &#34;Hyper-Convolutional Models&#34; is appropriate. Also, since the problem deals with sequences of purchases, &#34;Sequential Behavior Analysis&#34; fits here as it&#39;s about understanding user behavior over time.

They mention leveraging behavioral patterns from repeated purchases, which ties into &#34;User Behavior Modeling.&#34; This category would help users interested in how models capture and predict user actions based on past data.

The paper also talks about evaluating the model using multiple metrics across three datasets. So, categories like &#34;Evaluation Metrics&#34; and &#34;Benchmarking&#34; are relevant because they discuss performance measurement against existing methods.

Considering real-world applications, this could be applied in retail settings for personalized shopping experiences or optimizing product suggestions, so &#34;Retail Applications&#34; is a good fit. Additionally, since it&#39;s about suggesting items users have previously bought, &#34;Personalized Retail&#34; would capture that personalization aspect.

The model might deal with large datasets and scalability concerns in real-world applications, hence &#34;Scalability&#34; is another category to include. Although not explicitly mentioned, hyper-convolutional models are often designed with scalability in mind for handling extensive user and item data.

Lastly, the problem addresses a specific niche within recommendation systems, which could be of interest to researchers looking into specialized areas. Thus, adding &#34;Specialized Recommendation Problems&#34; makes sense as it highlights that this is a focused study within the broader field.

I should make sure I&#39;m covering both broad and specific categories. Let me see if I have 8-12. Currently, I&#39;ve listed: Recommendation Systems, Next Basket Recommendation, Repurchase Recommendation, Hyper-Convolutional Models, Sequential Behavior Analysis, User Behavior Modeling, Evaluation Metrics, Retail Applications, Scalability, Benchmarking, Personalized Retail, Specialized Recommendation Problems.

Wait, that&#39;s 11 categories, which is within the desired range. I think these cover both general areas and specific aspects of the paper, making it easier for users to find related content whether they&#39;re looking broadly or have a particular focus.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about Next Basket Repurchase Recommendation (NBRR). The title mentions a hyper-convolutional model, and the abstract talks about recommending items users have previously purchased for their next basket.

First, I&#39;ll break down the key elements from the title and abstract. The main focus is on recommendation systems, specifically within the context of e-commerce or retail since it&#39;s discussing baskets and repurchases. They mention a novel hyper-convolutional model, which falls under deep learning techniques. So I should include categories related to recommendation systems, convolutional models, and deep learning.

The problem addressed here is a variation of Next Basket Recommendation (NBR), so that&#39;s another category. The fact that it&#39;s about repurchasing items suggests it relates to consumer behavior or purchase patterns. It also deals with sequential data since it looks at the sequence of prior baskets, so temporal or sequential modeling makes sense as a category.

The approach uses hyper-convolutional layers, which is a specific type of neural network architecture, so that&#39;s another category. The article talks about leveraging behavioral patterns, which ties into user behavior analysis. Since they tested their model on real datasets and showed it outperforms existing methods, aspects like empirical evaluation or benchmarking would be relevant.

I should also consider the application area—this is likely applicable in e-commerce settings where understanding purchase history to recommend repurchases can improve customer retention or sales. So an e-commerce category makes sense. Additionally, since they used publicly available datasets and real-world applications, categories like A/B testing or user surveys might not directly apply here, but empirical evaluation does.

Looking at the guidelines, I need to assign multiple categories (8-12), so I&#39;ll make sure each aspect is covered without overlap. The categories should be clear and descriptive for users to easily navigate. Also, ensuring that these categories are balanced in terms of distribution across articles will help maintain a user-friendly interface.

I think I&#39;ve covered the main points: recommendation systems, deep learning, convolutional models, next basket recommendation, repurchase prediction, sequential modeling, consumer behavior, neural networks, hyper-convolutional layers, and empirical evaluation. That should give a comprehensive categorization for this article.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommendation Systems, Convolutional Models, Deep Learning, Next Basket Recommendation (NBR), Repurchase Prediction, Sequential Modeling, Consumer Behavior Analysis, Neural Networks, Hyper-Convolutional Layers, Empirical Evaluation</code></pre>
