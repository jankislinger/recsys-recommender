Title: Argument-based generation and explanation of recommendations
Abstract:
In the recommender systems literature, it has been shown that, in addition to improving system effectiveness, explaining recommendations may increase user satisfaction, trust, persuasion and loyalty. In general, explanations focus on the filtering algorithms or the users and items involved in the generation of recommendations. However, on certain domains that are rich on user-generated textual content, it would be valuable to provide justifications of recommendations according to arguments that are explicit, underlying or related with the data used by the systems, e.g., the reasons for customers’ opinions in reviews of e-commerce sites, and the requests and claims in citizens’ proposals and debates of e-participation platforms. In this context, there is a need and challenging task to automatically extract and exploit the arguments given for and against evaluated items. We thus advocate to focus not only on user preferences and item features, but also on associated arguments. In other words, we propose to not only consider what is said about items, but also why it is said. Hence, arguments would not only be part of the recommendation explanations, but could also be used by the recommendation algorithms themselves. To this end, in this thesis, we propose to use argument mining techniques and tools that allow retrieving and relating argumentative information from textual content, and investigate recommendation methods that exploit that information before, during and after their filtering processes.

Alright, so I&#39;m trying to figure out how to categorize this research article about argument-based generation and explanation of recommendations. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Argument-based generation and explanation of recommendations.&#34; That tells me it&#39;s focused on recommendation systems but with a twist involving arguments or reasoning behind those recommendations.

Looking at the abstract, the authors discuss how explaining recommendations can improve user satisfaction and trust. They mention that explanations usually focus on algorithms or users/items involved. But they suggest looking into domains rich in user-generated text, like e-commerce reviews or e-participation platforms. The idea is to extract arguments from these texts—like why customers liked or disliked a product—and use those arguments both for explaining recommendations and as part of the recommendation process itself.

So, the key points here are:

1. **Recommendation Systems**: The core topic.
2. **Explanations/Justifications**: Focusing on providing reasons behind recommendations.
3. **User-Generated Content**: Using textual data from users like reviews.
4. **Argument Mining**: Techniques to extract and analyze arguments from text.
5. **Trust and Persuasion**: Impact of explanations on user behavior.
6. **Real-world Applications**: Mentioning e-commerce and e-participation platforms.

Now, I need to map these points into relevant categories based on the guidelines provided. The example categories include things like family of algorithms, domain of problems, specific recommendation aspects, evaluation aspects, real-world applications, etc.

Starting with the algorithm aspect: They use argument mining techniques, which isn&#39;t a standard family but fits under Algorithmic Techniques or maybe Natural Language Processing (NLP) since it deals with text data.

Domain-wise, they mention e-commerce and citizen engagement platforms. So that&#39;s two domains right there.

For recommendation space specifics: It&#39;s about explanations and justifications, so categories like Justification of Recommendations, Explanation Mechanisms would be relevant.

Evaluation aspects: They talk about user satisfaction, trust, persuasion, which relates to Evaluation Metrics beyond accuracy—so Beyond Accuracy is a good fit. Also, they discuss improving system effectiveness through better explanations, tying into Effectiveness in recommendations.

Real-world applications: The thesis mentions using real data from platforms, so Real-World Applications and possibly Case Studies could apply here.

Other relevant categories might include User Trust since explaining can build trust, Persuasion as a user aspect, and maybe Textual Data Analysis because they&#39;re mining arguments from text.

I should also consider if there&#39;s overlap or more specific terms. For example, using argumentation in recommendations could be a unique angle, so maybe Argumentation-Based Recommendations or something similar. Also, since they discuss both the extraction of arguments and their use in recommendation processes, it touches on Content Analysis as part of the process.

I need to ensure each category is clear and user-friendly. Let me list out possible categories:

- **Recommendation Systems**: Broad category covering all recommendation-related topics.
- **Explanation Mechanisms**: Focused on providing explanations for recommendations.
- **Argument Mining**: Techniques used to extract arguments from text.
- **User Trust**: Impact of explanations on trust.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Since they&#39;re dealing with textual data and extracting information.
- **E-commerce**: One of the domains discussed.
- **Citizen Engagement Platforms**: Another domain mentioned.
- **Beyond Accuracy**: Evaluation metrics beyond traditional accuracy measures.
- **User Satisfaction**: Related to how explanations affect satisfaction.
- **Textual Data Analysis**: Involves analyzing user-generated text content.
- **Justification of Recommendations**: Providing reasons behind recommendations.
- **Persuasion**: Impact on persuading users through better explanations.

I need to ensure that each category is distinct and relevant. Also, avoiding too many overlapping categories. For example, Argument Mining and Textual Data Analysis are related but can stand separately as they cover different aspects—techniques vs. data type.

Considering the number of categories (8-12), I think this list covers most aspects without being too redundant. It includes algorithmic techniques, domains, specific recommendation aspects, evaluation metrics, real-world applications, and user-related impacts.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, I&#39;m looking at an article titled &#34;Argument-based generation and explanation of recommendations.&#34; The abstract talks about how explanations in recommender systems can improve user satisfaction and trust. It mentions focusing on the arguments behind user feedback, like reviews or debates, to enhance recommendation algorithms.

First, the core theme is recommendation systems, so that&#39;s a primary category. Argument mining is another key aspect because the article discusses extracting arguments from text. Explainable AI is relevant since it&#39;s about making recommendations clearer to users. 

The domain here seems to be around user-generated content, like reviews or e-commerce sites, so User-Generated Content is appropriate. The methodology involves argument extraction and reasoning, which ties into Argumentation Techniques.

Since the article emphasizes using arguments as part of recommendation algorithms, Argument-Based Recommendations is a fitting category. It also touches on improving trust through explanations, hence Trust in Recommender Systems.

Lastly, the focus on extracting information from text points to Text Mining. So, putting it all together, the categories should cover these aspects to ensure discoverability and alignment with user interests.
