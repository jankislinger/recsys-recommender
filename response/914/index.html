Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.

Title: Extended conversion: Capturing successful interactions in voice shopping
Abstract:
Being able to measure the success of online shopping interactions is crucial in order to evaluate and optimize the performance of e-commerce systems. We consider the domain of voice shopping, supported by digital voice-based assistants, where measuring successful interactions poses a challenge. Unlike Web shopping, which offers a rich amount of behavioral signals such as clicks, in voice shopping a non-negligible amount of shopping interactions frequently end without any immediate explicit or implicit user behavioral signal. Moreover, users may start their journey using voice, but finish elsewhere, for example by using their mobile app or Web. We explore the challenge of measuring successful interactions in voice product search based on usersâ€™ feedback, and propose a medium-term reward metric named Extended ConVersion (ECVR). ECVR extends the notion of conversion (purchase action), which is a clear and natural indication of success for an e-commerce system. The strength of this new metric, is that it does not only capture immediate conversion, but also a conversion that is part of the same user shopping journey, but is performed at a later stage, possibly using a different medium. We provide multiple ways of evaluating the quality of a metric, and use these to explore different parameters leading to different variants of ECVR. After finalizing these parameters, we show that a ranking system optimized for the proposed ECVR leads to an improvement in long-term engagement and revenue, without compromising immediate gains.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. Let&#39;s start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Extended conversion: Capturing successful interactions in voice shopping.&#34; The abstract discusses measuring the success of online shopping interactions, specifically focusing on voice shopping using digital assistants. It mentions challenges like users starting with voice but finishing elsewhere, such as mobile apps or web browsers. The article introduces a new metric called Extended ConVersion (ECVR) that captures both immediate and delayed conversions across different mediums.

Now, I&#39;ll break down the key elements from the title and abstract:

1. **Voice Shopping**: This is the primary domain discussed. So, &#34;Voice Shopping&#34; should definitely be one category.

2. **Digital Voice Assistants**: The article talks about systems supported by these assistants, so that&#39;s another category.

3. **E-commerce Systems**: Since it&#39;s about evaluating e-commerce performance, this fits as a relevant category.

4. **Extended ConVersion (ECVR)**: The new metric introduced is central to the research, making &#34;Extended Conversion&#34; a key category.

5. **Conversion Metrics**: This article is about improving how conversions are measured, so that&#39;s another important category.

6. **User Interaction Analysis**: They&#39;re analyzing user interactions in voice shopping, which falls under this category.

7. **Cross-Platform Behavior**: Users might start on one platform (voice) and end on another (web or app), so &#34;Cross-Platform&#34; is relevant.

8. **Long-Term Engagement**: The metric improves long-term engagement and revenue, making this a suitable category.

9. **Revenue Optimization**: Since the goal includes improving revenue without compromising immediate gains, this is important.

10. **Evaluation Metrics**: They discuss evaluating the quality of their new metric, so &#34;Evaluation Metrics&#34; fits here.

11. **Ranking Systems**: The article shows that optimizing ranking systems using ECVR leads to improvements, so including this makes sense.

I need to ensure each category accurately reflects the content and is user-friendly. I&#39;ll avoid overly specific categories unless they&#39;re central, like ECVR. Also, balancing the distribution, these categories seem sufficiently broad yet specific enough for users navigating through them.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. The title is &#34;Extended conversion: Capturing successful interactions in voice shopping.&#34; Let me read through the abstract carefully.

The article talks about measuring successful interactions in online shopping, specifically focusing on voice shopping with digital assistants. It mentions that unlike web shopping which has rich behavioral signals like clicks, voice shopping lacks these signals because users might start their journey via voice but finish elsewhere, like using a mobile app or website.

They introduce ECVR (Extended ConVersion), a new metric that captures conversions not just immediately but also in the same user shopping journey even if completed later through another medium. The authors discuss evaluating this metric and show that optimizing for ECVR improves long-term engagement and revenue without hurting immediate gains.

Now, considering the categories:

1. **Family of Algorithm**: The article doesn&#39;t mention a specific algorithm; it&#39;s more about metrics and evaluation. So maybe not applicable here.

2. **Domain of the problem**: Clearly e-commerce and voice shopping. Voice shopping is a subset of e-commerce but I&#39;ll include both for broader reach.

3. **Specific aspect in recommendation space**: They&#39;re talking about measuring user success, which relates to evaluation metrics. So Evaluation Metrics makes sense.

4. **Aspects of evaluation**: The article introduces ECVR as an evaluation metric focusing on conversions and long-term engagement, so this fits under Aspects of Evaluation.

5. **Real-world applications**: They mention voice-based assistants and real shopping interactions, indicating real-world applications. So Real-World Applications is appropriate.

6. **Other relevant categories**: Since it&#39;s about user interactions and optimizing systems based on metrics, User-Centered Design could be relevant as well.

I should ensure each article goes into at least 8-12 categories but here I have six. Maybe more? Let me think.

Another possible category is Metrics and Evaluation because they propose a new metric. Also, perhaps Scalability since it talks about improving engagement and revenue without compromising immediate gains, which could relate to scalability of the system.

Wait, they mention optimizing for ECVR leading to improvements in long-term metrics, so maybe Long-Term Impact or something like that. Alternatively, User Feedback is relevant because they consider user feedback in their metric.

So adding Metrics and Evaluation as a category makes sense. Also, considering the technology aspect, Voice-Based Systems is another potential category.

Let me list them:

- E-commerce
- Voice Shopping
- Conversion Rate
- Evaluation Metrics
- Aspects of Evaluation
- Real-World Applications
- User Feedback
- Scalability
- Optimization

That&#39;s nine categories, which meets the requirement. I should check if these are clear and relevant.
&lt;/think&gt;

E-commerce, Voice-Based Systems, Conversion Rate, Evaluation Metrics, Aspects of Evaluation, Real-World Applications, User Feedback, Scalability, Optimization</code></pre>
