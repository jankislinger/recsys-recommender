Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.

Title: “Serving Each User”: Supporting Different Eating Goals Through a Multi-List Recommender Interface
Abstract:
Food recommender systems optimize towards a user’s current preferences. However, appetites may vary, in the sense that users might seek healthy recipes today and look for unhealthy meals tomorrow. In this paper, we propose a novel approach in the food domain to diversify recommendations across different lists to ‘serve’ different users goals, compiled in a multi-list food recommender interface. We evaluated our interface in a 2 (single list vs multiple lists) x 2 (without or with explanations) between-subject user study (N = 366), linking choice behavior and evaluation aspects through the user experience framework. Our multi-list interface was evaluated more favorably than a single-list interface, in terms of diversity and choice satisfaction. Moreover, it triggered changes in food choices, even though these choices were less healthy than those made in the single-list interface.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories. The title is “Serving Each User”: Supporting Different Eating Goals Through a Multi-List Recommender Interface, and the abstract talks about food recommender systems that can cater to different user goals by using multiple lists. They tested it with 366 users in a study comparing single vs multi-list interfaces, along with explanations.

First, looking at the family of algorithms, since it&#39;s about recommendation systems, that&#39;s a primary category. The domain here is clearly food or nutrition because it&#39;s focused on food recommendations. It mentions supporting different eating goals, so personalization must be involved. 

The abstract also talks about multi-list interfaces, which suggests they&#39;re using some form of list-based recommendation approach. Evaluation aspects are discussed with user studies and A/B testing since they compared two interfaces. The evaluation metrics include diversity and choice satisfaction, so those categories fit. They mention triggering changes in food choices, which relates to behavior change, especially around diet or health.

The system is designed for a specific application in the food domain, so that&#39;s another category. The interface was evaluated with user studies and surveys, so real-world applications are present here. There&#39;s an emphasis on supporting different user goals, so personalization is key again. They used explanations alongside recommendations, which ties into explanation techniques. 

They also looked at how these recommendations affected user choices and satisfaction, so user experience is a factor. The study shows that while the multi-list interface was more satisfying, the choices were less healthy, indicating an ethical consideration around recommendation impact on health.

Putting it all together, I can list categories like Recommendation Systems (algorithm family), Food/Nutrition (domain), Personalization, Multi-List Recommendations, User Study/Evaluation Methods, A/B Testing, Diversity in Recommendations, Choice Satisfaction, Behavior Change (Diet/Health), Real World Applications, Explanation Techniques, and Ethical Considerations. That makes 12 categories, which fits the requirement.
&lt;/think&gt;

Recommendation Systems, Food/Nutrition, Personalization, Multi-List Recommendations, User Study/Evaluation Methods, A/B Testing, Diversity in Recommendations, Choice Satisfaction, Behavior Change (Diet/Health), Real World Applications, Explanation Techniques, Ethical Considerations</code></pre>

Okay, I need to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. Let me start by reading through them carefully.

The title is “Serving Each User”: Supporting Different Eating Goals Through a Multi-List Recommender Interface. So, it&#39;s about a food recommender system that supports various eating goals. The key here seems to be the multi-list interface that can cater to different user objectives, like healthy vs unhealthy meals.

Looking at the abstract: The paper discusses how users might have varying appetites or needs—seeking healthy recipes one day and unhealthy ones another. To address this, they propose a multi-list recommender interface that diversifies recommendations across different lists tailored to these varied goals. They conducted a user study comparing single vs multiple lists and with explanations, finding that the multi-list interface was more favorable in terms of diversity and choice satisfaction, though it led to less healthy choices.

Now, I need to map this to the categorization guidelines provided. The categories should include things like family of algorithms, domain, specific aspects in recommendation space, evaluation criteria, real-world applications, etc.

First, the domain is clearly food since it&#39;s a food recommender system. That&#39;s one category: Food.

Next, the article talks about supporting different eating goals, which sounds like personalized recommendations. So Personalized Recommendations would be another category.

The interface they developed is multi-list, so Multi-List Recommender is relevant. Also, since they&#39;re catering to varied user goals, User-Centric Design seems applicable as it focuses on individual needs and preferences.

They evaluated their system through a user study involving explanations, which ties into Evaluation with Explanations. Additionally, they looked at aspects like diversity and choice satisfaction, so Evaluation Metrics (diversity and beyond accuracy) is another category.

The interface&#39;s impact on food choices relates to Real-World Applications, specifically in the context of nutrition or health outcomes. Therefore, Real-World Application should be included.

The study used a between-subject design with explanations, which touches on User Feedback and Interfaces, so those could be relevant categories as well.

Putting it all together, I think the categories would be:

Food, Personalized Recommendations, Multi-List Recommender, User-Centric Design, Evaluation with Explanations, Evaluation Metrics, Real-World Application, User Feedback, Interfaces

I need to make sure each category is clear and that the article fits well within them. Also, ensuring there are enough categories without overcrowding any single one.
&lt;/think&gt;

Food, Personalized Recommendations, Multi-List Recommender, User-Centric Design, Evaluation with Explanations, Evaluation Metrics, Real-World Application, User Feedback, Interfaces</code></pre>
