Title: Utilizing Non-click Samples via Semi-supervised Learning for Conversion Rate Prediction
Abstract:
Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is essential in recommendation systems, facilitating precise matching between recommended items and users’ preferences. However, the sample selection bias (SSB) and data sparsity (DS) issues pose challenges to accurate prediction. Existing works have proposed the click-through and conversion rate (CTCVR) prediction task which models samples from exposure to “click and conversion” in entire space and incorporates multi-task learning. This approach has shown efficacy in mitigating these challenges. Nevertheless, it intensifies the false negative sample (FNS) problem. To be more specific, the CTCVR task implicitly treats all the CVR labels of non-click samples as negative, overlooking the possibility that some samples might convert if clicked. This oversight can negatively impact CVR model performance, as empirical analysis has confirmed. To this end, we advocate for discarding the CTCVR task and proposing a Non-click samples Improved Semi-supErvised (NISE) method for conversion rate prediction, where the non-click samples are treated as unlabeled. Our approach aims to predict their probabilities of conversion if clicked, utilizing these predictions as pseudo-labels for further model training. This strategy can help alleviate the FNS problem, and direct modeling of the CVR task across the entire space also mitigates the SSB and DS challenges. Additionally, we conduct multi-task learning by introducing an auxiliary click-through rate prediction task, thereby enhancing embedding layer representations. Our approach is applicable to various multi-task architectures. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both public and production datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed method in mitigating the FNS challenge and improving the CVR estimation.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its title and abstract. The goal is to make it easy for users to find the article when exploring different topics. Let&#39;s start by reading through the provided information carefully.

The title of the article is &#34;Utilizing Non-Click Samples via Semi-Supervised Learning for Conversion Rate Prediction.&#34; From this, I can gather that the main focus is on improving conversion rate prediction in recommendation systems using non-click data and semi-supervised learning methods. 

Looking at the abstract, it explains that conversion rate (CVR) prediction is crucial but faces challenges like sample selection bias (SSB) and data sparsity (DS). The authors discuss existing approaches that use click-through and conversion rate (CTCVR) prediction with multi-task learning, which helps mitigate some issues. However, this approach increases the false negative samples (FNS) problem because non-click samples are treated as negatives without considering if they might convert if clicked.

The article proposes a new method called NISE (Non-Click Improved Semi-Supervised), which treats non-click samples as unlabeled and uses semi-supervised learning to predict their conversion probabilities. These predictions become pseudo-labels for further training, aiming to reduce FNS and address SSB and DS. Additionally, they use multi-task learning by adding a click-through rate (CTR) prediction task to enhance model representations.

Now, considering the guidelines for categorization:

1. **Categorization Accuracy**: The article is about CVR prediction in recommendation systems, using semi-supervised learning on non-click samples. It addresses issues like sample selection bias and data sparsity, and uses multi-task learning with CTR as an auxiliary task.

2. **Category Utility**: I should ensure the categories are broad enough to include this article but specific enough so they&#39;re useful. Since it&#39;s about recommendation systems, that’s a primary category. The method involves semi-supervised learning, which is another category. 

3. **User-Centric Design**: Users might be interested in conversion rate prediction specifically or more generally in recommendation techniques. So categories like Conversion Rate Prediction and Recommendation Systems would be relevant.

4. **Consistency**: Using established terms to avoid confusion. Terms like Semi-Supervised Learning are standard, as is Click-Through Rate.

Other aspects from the abstract include the use of non-click samples, which could be a specific category. The problem it addresses includes issues like Sample Selection Bias and Data Sparsity, so those should also be included as categories.

Additionally, since they mention multi-task learning with CTR prediction, that&#39;s another relevant category. The focus on improving model performance through better handling of non-click data ties into aspects like Model Improvement or Enhanced Models.

Putting it all together, the categories should cover both the method (semi-supervised learning) and the problem areas (conversion rate, recommendation systems), as well as specific issues addressed (non-click samples, sample selection bias). Also, considering the evaluation aspect from the guidelines, since they discuss improving prediction accuracy, categories like Prediction Accuracy or Model Performance could be relevant.

I should aim for at least 8-12 categories. Let me list them out:

- Semi-Supervised Learning: Since the method uses semi-supervised techniques.
- Conversion Rate Prediction: The main focus of the article.
- Recommendation Systems: The application area.
- Click-Through Rate (CTR): Mentioned as an auxiliary task.
- Sample Selection Bias: A problem addressed.
- Data Sparsity: Another issue tackled.
- Multi-Task Learning: Technique used for model improvement.
- Non-Click Samples: Focus on utilizing these samples effectively.
- False Negative Samples: Problem they aim to mitigate.
- Model Improvement: The goal of their approach.
- User Behavior Prediction: Since it&#39;s about predicting user actions (clicks, conversions).
- Enhanced Models: Because the method enhances existing models.

I think that covers all relevant aspects. Each category is specific enough but also broad enough to be useful for navigation. They align with user interests in recommendation systems and machine learning techniques.
&lt;/think&gt;

Alright, I&#39;m looking at this article titled &#34;Utilizing Non-click Samples via Semi-supervised Learning for Conversion Rate Prediction.&#34; The abstract discusses conversion rate prediction in recommendation systems, focusing on challenges like sample selection bias and data sparsity. It introduces a new method called NISE that treats non-click samples as unlabeled data and uses semi-supervised learning to improve predictions.

First, I need to categorize this article accurately. The main focus is on conversion rate prediction, which falls under recommendation systems. So &#34;Conversion Rate Prediction&#34; and &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; are primary categories.

Next, the article addresses sample selection bias and data sparsity, so those should be included as well. It also discusses semi-supervised learning, which is a machine learning technique, so that&#39;s another category.

The method proposed, NISE, deals with non-click samples, suggesting it&#39;s relevant to click behavior analysis. Therefore, &#34;Click Behavior&#34; and &#34;Non-Click Samples&#34; are appropriate categories.

Since the approach involves multi-task learning, adding &#34;Multi-task Learning&#34; makes sense. The experiments conducted use public and production datasets, so &#34;Evaluation Metrics&#34; is relevant here.

Finally, the article improves model performance through better training strategies, so including &#34;Model Performance Improvement&#34; captures that aspect.
&lt;/think&gt;
