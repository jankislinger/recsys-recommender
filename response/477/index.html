        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: How Can They Know That? A Study of Factors Affecting the Creepiness of Recommendations
Abstract:
Recommender systems (RS) often use implicit user preferences extracted from behavioral and contextual data, in addition to traditional rating-based preference elicitation, to increase the quality and accuracy of personalized recommendations. However, these approaches may harm user experience by causing mixed emotions, such as fear, anxiety, surprise, discomfort, or creepiness. RS should consider users’ feelings, expectations, and reactions that result from being shown personalized recommendations. This paper investigates the creepiness of recommendations using an online experiment in three domains: movies, hotels, and health. We define the feeling of creepiness caused by recommendations and find out that it is already known to users of RS. We further find out that the perception of creepiness varies across domains and depends on recommendation features, like causal ambiguity and accuracy. By uncovering possible consequences of creepy recommendations, we also learn that creepiness can have a negative influence on brand and platform attitudes, purchase or consumption intention, user experience, and users’ expectations of‚ and their trust in, RS. i&gt;Presentation: Tuesday Poster Lunch&lt;/i

Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article based on its title and abstract. The title is &#34;How Can They Know That? A Study of Factors Affecting the Creepiness of Recommendations&#34; and the abstract talks about recommender systems (RS) using implicit user preferences from behavioral and contextual data to improve recommendations. However, these methods can make users feel creeped out because they might fear their privacy or find the recommendations intrusive.

First, I&#39;ll start by identifying the main themes. The article is definitely about Recommender Systems since it&#39;s a study on RS factors affecting creepiness. That seems like an obvious category.

Next, the abstract mentions using implicit user preferences extracted from behavioral and contextual data. So, Implicit Feedback should be another category because that&#39;s a key aspect of how RS works here.

The study looks at three domains: movies, hotels, and health. These are specific areas where recommendations can cause creepiness, so I&#39;ll include Movies, Hotels, and Healthcare as categories. Each domain might have different factors contributing to the feeling of creepiness.

The abstract also discusses user reactions such as fear, anxiety, surprise, discomfort, or creepiness. This ties into User Experience because it&#39;s about how users feel when interacting with RS. So, User Experience should be a category.

There&#39;s mention of an online experiment conducted across these domains, which indicates that the research is empirical and applied rather than theoretical. Therefore, Experimental Study fits as another category.

The factors affecting creepiness include causal ambiguity and accuracy of recommendations. Causal Ambiguity refers to users not understanding how RS make decisions, leading to feelings of creepiness. So that&#39;s a specific aspect within recommendation systems.

Additionally, the study explores how creepiness affects brand and platform attitudes, purchase intentions, user experience, trust in RS, etc. This shows that the research is looking at broader implications beyond just the recommendations themselves. Hence, Psychological Impact seems appropriate as it captures the emotional and attitudinal effects on users.

Looking back at the guidelines, I need to assign 8-12 categories. Let me count: Recommender Systems, Implicit Feedback, Movies, Hotels, Healthcare, User Experience, Experimental Study, Causal Ambiguity, Psychological Impact. That&#39;s nine categories. I think that covers all the main points without being too redundant.

I should ensure each category is clear and user-friendly. For example, &#34;Healthcare&#34; instead of a more technical term to keep it accessible. Also, &#34;Psychological Impact&#34; accurately reflects the study&#39;s focus on user emotions and reactions.

Lastly, making sure there are no overlaps or unnecessary categories. Each one adds value by highlighting different facets of the research.
&lt;/think&gt;
