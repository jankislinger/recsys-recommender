        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Cold-start News Recommendation with Domain-dependent Browse Graph
Abstract:
Online social networks and mash-up services create opportunities to connect different web services otherwise isolated. Specifically in the case of news, users are very much exposed to news articles while performing other activities, such as social networking or web searching. Browsing behaviour aimed to the consumption of news, especially in relation to the visits coming from other domains, has been mainly overlooked in previous work. To address that, we build a BrowseGraph out of the collective browsing traces extracted from a large viewlog of Yahoo News (0.5B entries) and we define the ReferrerGraph as its subgraph induced by the sessions with the same referrer domain. The structural and temporal properties of the graph show that browsing behavior in news is highly dependent on the referrer URL of the session, in terms of type of content consumed and time of consumption. We build on this observation and propose a news recommender that addresses the cold-start problem: given a user landing on a page of the site for the first time, we aim to predict the page she will visit next. We compare 24 flavors of recommenders belonging to the families of content-based, popularity-based, and browsing-based models. We show that the browsing-based recommender that take into account the referrer URL is the best performing, achieving a prediction accuracy of 61% in conditions of heavy data sparsity.

Alright, so I need to categorize this research article about cold-start news recommendation using a browse graph. Let me go through it step by step.

First, looking at the title: &#34;Cold-Start News Recommendation with Domain-dependent Browse Graph.&#34; That immediately tells me the main topics are Cold Start and News Recommendation. The mention of aBrowse Graph suggests it&#39;s related to user behavior analysis or something involving graphs in recommendation systems.

Moving on to the abstract: It talks about online social networks and mash-up services connecting different web services, specifically focusing on news consumption during other activities like social networking or web searching. So that adds Domains like Social Networking and Web Searching as relevant categories.

The article mentions building a BrowseGraph from browsing traces in Yahoo News viewlogs (0.5B entries). This indicates the use of large datasets for analysis, so Large Datasets should be another category. They also define a ReferrerGraph as a subgraph based on referrer domains, which ties into Domain Analysis and maybe even Graph Theory.

The structural and temporal properties of these graphs are discussed, showing that browsing behavior in news is highly dependent on the referrer URL in terms of content type and consumption time. This points to User Behavior Analysis being a key category.

They propose a news recommender system addressing the cold-start problem. When a user lands on a page for the first time, they predict the next page visit. They compare 24 recommenders from families like content-based, popularity-based, and browsing-based models. So, Recommender Systems is definitely a primary category here.

The evaluation shows that browsing-based recommenders considering referrer URLs perform best with 61% accuracy under heavy data sparsity. This means aspects of Evaluation are important, particularly in terms of Accuracy and Data Sparsity.

Putting it all together: The article deals with Cold Start, Recommender Systems specific to News. It uses concepts like Browse Graph (Graph-based Models), Domain Analysis since they look at different referrer domains, and involves User Behavior Analysis through their browsing patterns. They work with large datasets, so that&#39;s another category. Their approach is in the realm of Web Systems because it deals with online behavior across various web services.

I should also consider if there are any real-world applications mentionedâ€”since they implemented this on Yahoo News, but the output doesn&#39;t require specific company mentions unless necessary. The main takeaway is their method and results, so I think focusing on the categories like Real-World Applications might be applicable here because they used a large-scale dataset from a real service.

Wait, but in the examples provided earlier, the user specified categories like whether there are any real-world applications (e.g., A/B Test, User Survey). Since this uses Yahoo News data, it&#39;s a real application context. So Real-World Applications should be included.

So compiling all these thoughts:

1. Cold Start: Directly mentioned in the title and addressed as the problem.
2. Recommender Systems: The main focus of the research.
3. News: The domain they&#39;re applying recommendations to.
4. Browse Graph: A specific method or model used, which is a type of graph-based approach.
5. Domain Analysis: They analyze different referrer domains.
6. User Behavior Analysis: Understanding how users browse and consume news.
7. Large Datasets: Working with 0.5B entries indicates handling large-scale data.
8. Web Systems: Because it&#39;s about online behavior across web services.

I think that covers the main points. Each category should be broad enough to fit within existing categories but specific enough to provide meaningful navigation for users looking into recommendation systems, cold-start problems, or related areas in web systems and user behavior.
&lt;/think&gt;
