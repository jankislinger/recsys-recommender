        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: ExcUseMe: Asking Users to Help in Item Cold-Start Recommendations
Abstract:
The item cold-start problem is of a great importance in collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation systems. It arises when new items are added to the inventory and the system cannot model them properly since it relies solely on historical users’ interactions (e.g., ratings). Much work has been devoted to mitigate this problem mostly by employing hybrid approaches that combine content-based recommendation techniques or by devoting a portion of the user traffic for exploration to gather interactions from random users. We focus on pure CF recommender systems (i.e., without content or context information) in a realistic online setting, where random exploration is inefficient and smart exploration that carefully selects users is crucial due to the huge flux of new items with short lifespan. We further assume that users arrive randomly one after the other and that the system has to immediately decide whether the arriving user will participate in the exploration of the new items. For this setting we present , a smart exploration algorithm that selects a predefined number of users for exploring new items. gradually excavates the users that are more likely to be interested in the new items and models the new items based on the users’ interactions. We evaluated on several datasets and scenarios and compared it to state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results indicate that is an efficient algorithm that outperforms all other algorithms in all tested scenarios.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about ExcUseMe: Asking Users to Help in Item Cold-Start Recommendations. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Item Cold-Start Recommendations,&#34; which immediately tells me one of the key categories should be related to cold start problems in recommendation systems. That makes sense because the article is specifically addressing that issue.

Looking at the abstract, it talks about collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation systems. So another category is Collaborative Filtering. The problem discussed is item cold-start, which is a well-known challenge in CF when new items are introduced without enough historical data.

The authors mention that they focus on pure CF systems without content or context information. This suggests that Content-Based Recommendations might be relevant as a contrast or alternative approach they&#39;re not using. So I should include Content-Based Recommendations as a category.

They discuss real-world applications, especially in online settings where random exploration is inefficient. They present ExcUseMe, an algorithm designed for smart exploration by selecting users to help model new items. This indicates that Real-World Applications and Online Settings are important categories.

The method they use involves user selection strategies to gather interactions efficiently. So User Selection Strategies would be another category. Since the goal is to model new items based on these selected users&#39; interactions, New Item Modeling is also relevant.

The article evaluates their algorithm against state-of-the-art methods using several datasets and scenarios. This points towards Evaluation as a key category because it&#39;s about assessing performance in recommendation systems.

Since they are improving upon existing approaches by focusing on smart exploration rather than random user selection, this falls under Algorithm Improvement. Their method is efficient and outperforms others, which ties into Recommendation System Efficiency.

Another aspect they touch on is the short lifespan of new items, implying that their approach needs to work quickly without waiting for enough data naturally. This relates to Short Lifespan Items as a category.

Putting it all together, the categories should cover both the specific problem (Item Cold-Start), the methodological approach (Collaborative Filtering, User Selection Strategies, Smart Exploration), the context (Online Settings, Real-World Applications), evaluation aspects (Evaluation in Recommendation Systems), and improvements or efficiencies (Algorithm Improvement, Recommendation System Efficiency, New Item Modeling). Also, considering content-based approaches as a contrast is useful. Finally, the challenge of handling items with short lifespans adds another layer.

I think that&#39;s a comprehensive coverage based on the abstract.
&lt;/think&gt;

Item Cold-Start, Collaborative Filtering, User Selection Strategies, Smart Exploration, Real-World Applications, Online Settings, Content-Based Recommendations, Algorithm Improvement, Evaluation in Recommendation Systems, New Item Modeling, Short Lifespan Items.</code></pre>
