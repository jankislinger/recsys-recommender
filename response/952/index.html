Title: Broadening the Scope: Evaluating the Potential of Recommender Systems beyond prioritizing Accuracy
Abstract:
Although beyond-accuracy metrics have gained attention in the last decade, the accuracy of recommendations is still considered the gold standard to evaluate Recommender Systems (RSs). This approach prioritizes the accuracy of recommendations, neglecting the quality of suggestions to enhance user needs, such as diversity and novelty, as well as trustworthiness regulations in RSs for user and provider fairness. As a result, single metrics determine the success of RSs, but this approach fails to consider other criteria simultaneously. A downside of this method is that the most accurate model configuration may not excel in addressing the remaining criteria. This study seeks to broaden RS evaluation by introducing a multi-objective evaluation that considers all model configurations simultaneously under several perspectives. To achieve this, several hyper-parameter configurations of an RS model are trained, and the Pareto-optimal ones are retrieved. The Quality Indicators (QI) of Pareto frontiers, which are gaining interest in Multi-Objective Optimization research, are adapted to RSs. QI enables evaluating the modelâ€™s performance by considering various configurations and giving the same importance to each metric. The experiments show that this multi-objective evaluation overturns the ranking of performance among RSs, paving the way to revisit the evaluation approaches of the RecSys research community. We release codes and datasets in the following GitHub repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RecMOE-3ED3.

Alright, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its content. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Broadening the Scope: Evaluating the Potential of Recommender Systems beyond Prioritizing Accuracy.&#34; The abstract talks about how while beyond-accuracy metrics have gained attention, accuracy remains the primary focus in evaluating Recommender Systems (RSs). It points out that this approach neglects other important aspects like diversity, novelty, trustworthiness, user fairness, and provider fairness. The study introduces a multi-objective evaluation method using Pareto-optimal configurations and adapts Quality Indicators from Multi-Objective Optimization research.

Okay, so the main themes here are beyond accuracy metrics in recommendation systems, multi-objective optimization, evaluation methods, diversity, fairness, and trustworthiness. There&#39;s also mention of real-world applications like user surveys or A/B tests since they&#39;re discussing how these evaluations impact users and providers.

I should map these themes into categories. From the examples given, I can think of categories like &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; which is a key focus here. Since it&#39;s about evaluating multiple metrics simultaneously, &#34;Multi-Objective Optimization&#34; fits well. The study discusses different evaluation aspects, so &#34;Evaluation Methods&#34; is relevant. They mention diversity and novelty as important factors, so those are separate categories. Trustworthiness, user fairness, and provider fairness are also discussed, each of which should be their own category.

The approach uses Pareto frontiers and Quality Indicators, which ties into optimization techniques in recommendation systems. There&#39;s an emphasis on broadening the scope beyond traditional metrics, so &#34;Broadening Scope&#34; makes sense as a category. The study addresses real-world applications by considering user needs and fairness, so &#34;Real-World Applications&#34; is appropriate.

I should also consider if there are other aspects like methodology or datasets mentioned, but since they provided code and datasets on GitHub, that might fall under reproducibility or resources, but the main focus here isn&#39;t on the dataset itself but rather the evaluation methods. So sticking to the categories related to evaluation and their impact is better.

I need to ensure each article is in 8-12 categories, so I&#39;ll list out all these themes as separate categories. They should be clear and descriptive without being too specific or too broad. 

So the final categories are: Beyond Accuracy, Multi-Objective Optimization, Evaluation Methods, Diversity of Recommendations, Fairness (User), Fairness (Provider), Trustworthiness, Quality Indicators, Pareto Frontiers, Recommender Systems, Broadening Scope, Real-World Applications.

I think these cover all the main points from the abstract and align with the user-centric design by focusing on evaluation aspects that matter to users beyond just accuracy.
&lt;/think&gt;

Beyond Accuracy, Multi-Objective Optimization, Evaluation Methods, Diversity of Recommendations, Fairness (User), Fairness (Provider), Trustworthiness, Quality Indicators, Pareto Frontiers, Recommender Systems, Broadening Scope, Real-World Applications</code></pre>

Alright, I need to categorize this article based on its title and abstract. Let&#39;s start by reading through them carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Broadening the Scope&#34; and focuses on evaluating recommender systems beyond prioritizing accuracy. That immediately tells me that the article is about evaluation metrics in recommendation systems, specifically moving away from just accuracy. 

Looking at the abstract, it talks about beyond-accuracy metrics which have gained attention but are still not the main focus. The study introduces a multi-objective evaluation approach that considers various aspects like diversity, novelty, trustworthiness, and fairness for both users and providers. They use Pareto-optimal configurations and Quality Indicators from Multi-Objective Optimization research.

So, breaking this down, the key themes here are:

1. **Beyond Accuracy**: The article is clearly about moving beyond just measuring accuracy in recommendation systems.
2. **Evaluation Methods**: It&#39;s discussing new evaluation techniques that consider multiple objectives simultaneously.
3. **Multi-Objective Evaluation**: They&#39;re using a multi-objective approach which suggests this is a core theme.
4. **Diversity and Novelty**: These are mentioned as important aspects the evaluation now considers.
5. **Trustworthiness**: Trust in recommendations is another focus area.
6. **Fairness**: The study includes fairness for both users and providers, so that&#39;s another category.
7. **Recommender Systems (RSs)**: This is the general domain or application of the research.

I think these are the main categories. Assigning 8-12 as per guidelines, but since the key points are covered here, maybe expand a bit more if needed, but from what&#39;s given, these seem to be the most relevant and specific.
&lt;/think&gt;

Beyond Accuracy, Evaluation Methods, Multi-Objective Evaluation, Diversity, Novelty, Trustworthiness, Fairness, Recommender Systems</code></pre>
