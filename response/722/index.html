Title: Boosting Local Recommendations With Partially Trained Global Model
Abstract:
Building recommendation systems for enterprise software has many unique challenges that are different from consumer-facing systems. When applied to different organizations, the data used to power those recommendation systems vary substantially in both quality and quantity due to differences in their operational practices, marketing strategies, and targeted audiences. At Salesforce, as a cloud provider of such a system with data across many different organizations, naturally, it makes sense to pool data from different organizations to build a model that combines all values from different brands. However, multiple issues like how do we make sure a model trained with pooled data can still capture customer specific characteristics, how do we design the system to handle those data responsibly and ethically, i.e., respecting contractual agreements with our clients, legal and compliance requirements, and the privacy of all the consumers. In this proposal, We present a framework that not only utilizes enriched user-level data across organizations, but also boosts business-specific characteristics in generating personal recommendations. We will also walk through key privacy considerations when designing such a system.

Okay, so I need to categorize this research article about recommendation systems for enterprise software. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Boosting Local Recommendations With Partially Trained Global Model.&#34; That suggests they&#39;re combining global data with local or organization-specific models to improve recommendations. 

Looking at the abstract, it mentions that building recommendation systems for enterprise software has unique challenges compared to consumer systems. The issues include varying data quality and quantity across different organizations because of their operational practices, marketing strategies, and targeted audiences. Salesforce is mentioned as a cloud provider using data from multiple organizations.

The key points here are:
1. Enterprise-level recommendations: So the domain is enterprise or business software.
2. Pooling data from different organizations to build models but ensuring customer-specific characteristics are captured.
3. Privacy and ethical considerations in handling pooled data, respecting contracts, legal compliance, and consumer privacy.
4. The framework presented uses enriched user-level data across organizations while boosting business-specific recommendations.

So I need to map these points into categories based on the guidelines provided. Let&#39;s go through each point:

1. **Enterprise Recommendations**: This is a specific domain in recommendation systems, so that&#39;s one category.
2. **Cross-Organizational Data Pooling**: It involves combining data from multiple organizations, which relates to how data is aggregated and used across different entities.
3. **Privacy Considerations**: Handling user privacy when pooling data is crucial, especially for enterprise solutions where compliance is a big concern.
4. **Model Adaptation**: Theyâ€™re talking about using a partially trained global model, so this involves adapting models to specific contexts or organizations.
5. **Data Quality and Quantity Variability**: Different organizations have varying data, so this aspect is important in recommendation systems that handle diverse datasets.
6. **Ethical Data Handling**: Ensuring the system respects contractual agreements and complies with legal requirements ties into ethical considerations.
7. **Scalability and Generalizability**: Since they&#39;re pooling data across many organizations, their approach needs to be scalable and applicable to various contexts.

I also think about other relevant categories:
- **Hybrid Recommendation Systems**: Combining global and local models is a hybrid approach.
- **Multi-Tenant Systems**: Salesforce serves multiple tenants (organizations), so this could fit here as well.
- **Personalization at Scale**: The goal is to provide personalized recommendations across different organizations, which requires scalable methods.

Putting it all together, I should assign the article to categories that cover its focus on enterprise settings, cross-organization data use, privacy and ethics, model adaptation, and scalability. Additionally, including aspects like data variability and hybrid approaches will ensure comprehensive categorization for discoverability.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about recommendation systems for enterprise software. The title is &#34;Boosting Local Recommendations With Partially Trained Global Model&#34; and the abstract talks about challenges faced by enterprise systems compared to consumer ones.

First, looking at the key themes. It mentions building a global model using data from multiple organizations but ensuring that each organization&#39;s specific characteristics are captured. That makes me think about scalability because handling data across many organizations must involve scaling up resources and infrastructure. Also, when dealing with large datasets, computational efficiency is crucial to train models without excessive resource consumption.

The abstract also touches on privacy concerns and respecting client agreements, which falls under ethical considerations. Data security is a big part of this, as enterprises handle sensitive information. So I should include both Scalability and Ethical Considerations here.

The framework they propose uses enriched user-level data across organizations to enhance local recommendations. This suggests that the system architecture must be robust enough to integrate diverse data sources effectively. Therefore, System Architecture seems relevant.

They mention boosting business-specific characteristics in recommendations, which implies customization based on individual organizational needs. So Customization and Local Recommendations would be appropriate categories as well.

Looking at other aspects, while they don&#39;t explicitly talk about real-world applications like A/B testing or user surveys, the focus is more on privacy and ethical design, so maybe Privacy-PreservingRecommendations could be a category too. Also, the mention of contractual agreements leads me to think about Compliance in AI.

So putting it all together, I&#39;d categorize this article under Scalability, Computational Efficiency, Ethical Considerations, System Architecture, Customization, Local Recommendations, and Compliance in AI.
&lt;/think&gt;

Scalability, Computational Efficiency, Ethical Considerations, System Architecture, Customization, Local Recommendations, Privacy-PreservingRecommendations, Compliance in AI</code></pre>
