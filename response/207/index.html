Title: Accuracy and Diversity in Cross-domain Recommendations for Cold-start Users with Positive-only Feedback
Abstract:
Computing useful recommendations for cold-start users is a major challenge in the design of recommender systems, and additional data is often required to compensate the scarcity of user feedback. In this paper we address such problem in a target domain by exploiting user preferences from a related auxiliary domain. Following a rigorous methodology for cold-start, we evaluate a number of recommendation methods on a dataset with positive-only feedback in the movie and music domains, both in single and cross-domain scenarios. Comparing the methods in terms of item ranking accuracy, diversity and catalog coverage, we show that cross-domain preference data is useful to provide more accurate suggestions when user feedback in the target domain is scarce or not available at all, and may lead to more diverse recommendations depending on the target domain. Moreover, evaluating the impact of the user profile size and diversity in the source domain, we show that, in general, the quality of target recommendations increases with the size of the profile, but may deteriorate with too diverse profiles.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories based on its content. Let me start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Accuracy and Diversity in Cross-domain Recommendations for Cold-start Users with Positive-only Feedback.&#34; So right away, I can note that the main topics are accuracy, diversity, cross-domain recommendations, cold-start users, and positive-only feedback.

Looking at the abstract, it discusses challenges in recommender systems, especially when dealing with new users (cold-start). They use auxiliary domains to help with recommendations. The evaluation includes methods for accuracy, diversity, and catalog coverage. It also talks about the impact of user profile size and diversity in the source domain.

Now, I&#39;ll map these elements to potential categories:

1. **Cold Start**: Directly mentioned as a key focus.
2. **Cross-domain Recommendations**: A major aspect since they&#39;re using data from related domains.
3. **Accuracy**: Evaluated as a primary metric.
4. **Diversity of Recommendations**: Another main evaluation criterion.
5. **Catalog Coverage**: Mentioned in the context of evaluation, so it&#39;s relevant.
6. **Positive-only Feedback**: The type of feedback used in their dataset.
7. **Movie Domain**: One of the target domains they tested on.
8. **Music Domain**: Another target domain mentioned.
9. **User Profile Analysis**: They looked at profile size and diversity, so this fits.

I should ensure each category is clear and user-friendly. Also, I need to make sure there are enough categories without overcrowding any. These nine seem appropriate based on the content. Let me double-check if I&#39;m missing anything. The abstract also mentions &#34;rigorous methodology&#34; but that&#39;s more about their approach rather than a category. It doesn&#39;t fit into an existing one well, so maybe skip it for now.

I think these categories cover all main aspects of the article.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about cross-domain recommendations for cold-start users. Let me read through it carefully.

The title mentions &#34;Accuracy and Diversity&#34; which are evaluation metrics. It also talks about &#34;Cross-domain Recommendations&#34; which suggests they&#39;re using data from other domains. The problem addressed is with &#34;Cold-start Users,&#34; meaning those who don&#39;t have much interaction history. They used positive-only feedback, so only likes or preferences, not explicit ratings.

In the abstract, they mention evaluating recommendation methods on a dataset for movies and music, both single and cross-domain. So they&#39;re looking at how well these methods perform when data is scarce in one domain but available in another.

Key points from the abstract: They focus on accuracy and diversity of recommendations. They use cold-start users with positive-only feedback. The domains involved are movie and music. They also discuss catalog coverage, which relates to how well the recommendations cover different items.

They evaluated methods&#39; impact based on user profile size and diversity in the source domain. Larger profiles generally help, but too diverse might hurt recommendation quality.

So, thinking about categories, I should consider evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Diversity), aspects of cold-start users, types of feedback (Positive-only Feedback), the cross-domain aspect, specific domains (Movies, Music), and maybe other relevant topics like Catalog Coverage.

I need to assign 8-12 categories. Let me list potential ones:

1. Accuracy: Directly mentioned as an evaluation metric.
2. Diversity: Also a key metric they evaluated.
3. Cold Start: The main problem addressed.
4. Positive-only Feedback: Type of feedback used.
5. Cross-domain Recommendations: Core method discussed.
6. Movie Domain: One of the domains studied.
7. Music Domain: Another domain involved.
8. Evaluation Metrics: General category for evaluation aspects.
9. Catalog Coverage: Mentioned in the abstract as part of their comparison.
10. User Profile Size: Discussed in terms of impact on recommendation quality.
11. Feedback Types: Since they used positive-only, this is relevant.
12. Recommendation Methods: They evaluated various methods.

Wait, I have 12 categories here. Let me check if all are necessary and distinct:

- Accuracy
- Diversity
- Cold Start
- Positive-only Feedback
- Cross-domain Recommendations
- Movie Domain
- Music Domain
- Evaluation Metrics (maybe redundant with Accuracy and Diversity)
- Catalog Coverage
- User Profile Size
- Feedback Types
- Recommendation Methods

I think &#34;Evaluation Metrics&#34; is already covered by Accuracy and Diversity, so maybe remove it. Also, &#34;Feedback Types&#34; can be considered as Positive-only Feedback.

So the final categories might be:

Accuracy, Diversity, Cold Start, Positive-only Feedback, Cross-domain Recommendations, Movie Domain, Music Domain, Catalog Coverage, User Profile Size, Recommendation Methods.

Wait, that&#39;s 10. Maybe add another like Scalability or something else? But I don&#39;t see scalability mentioned in the abstract. Alternatively, maybe &#34;Real-world Applications&#34; since they used datasets from movies and music, which are real domains.

Alternatively, stick to what&#39;s clearly there. Let me make sure each category is directly relevant and not too broad. I think the 10 categories above cover all the key aspects without adding fluff.
&lt;/think&gt;

Accuracy, Diversity, Cold Start, Positive-only Feedback, Cross-domain Recommendations, Movie Domain, Music Domain, Catalog Coverage, User Profile Size, Recommendation Methods</code></pre>
