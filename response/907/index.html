Title: Incorporating Time in Sequential Recommendation Models
Abstract:
Sequential models are designed to learn sequential patterns in data based on the chronological order of user interactions. However, they often ignore the timestamps of these interactions. Incorporating time is crucial because many sequential patterns are time-dependent, and the model cannot make time-aware recommendations without considering time. This article demonstrates that providing a rich representation of time can significantly improve the performance of sequential models. The existing literature treats time as a one-dimensional time-series obtained by quantizing time. In this study, we propose treating time as a multi-dimensional time-series and explore representation learning methods, including  a kernel based method and an embedding-based algorithm. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the inclusion of time significantly enhances the modelâ€™s performance, and multi-dimensional methods outperform the one-dimensional method by a substantial margin.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into relevant categories for user-friendly navigation. Let me start by reading through the title and abstract to understand what it&#39;s about.

The title is &#34;Incorporating Time in Sequential Recommendation Models.&#34; So it&#39;s about recommendation systems that take time into account when making suggestions. The abstract mentions sequential models, which learn patterns from user interactions over time. It points out that existing models often ignore timestamps, but incorporating time is crucial for better recommendations. They propose treating time as a multi-dimensional series instead of just one-dimensional, and they tested this with experiments showing improved performance.

First, the family of algorithm: Sequential Models are definitely involved here because the article focuses on them. The methods used include Kernel-based methods and Embedding-based algorithms, so those should be included too. Time Series is another category since the article deals with time data, especially multi-dimensional time series.

Next, looking at aspects related to recommendations. It&#39;s about sequential recommendations, so that&#39;s a key category. Temporal Dynamics comes into play because they&#39;re considering how time affects recommendations. The problem domain here seems specific to recommendation systems in general but also touches on improving model performance, which ties into Model Enhancement and Representation Learning.

In terms of evaluation aspects, the article discusses performance improvements, so Performance Analysis is relevant. They also mention experiments across datasets, showing that multi-dimensional methods work better, which points towards Methodological Innovations since they&#39;re introducing a new approach to handling time.

Additionally, the study shows practical applications in enhancing recommendation systems, so there&#39;s an Applied Research angle. The focus on user interaction patterns over time fits into User Behavior Analysis. Since the model accounts for the sequence and timing of interactions, it relates to Sequential Pattern Mining.

Putting this all together, I need to make sure each category is clear and relevant without being too narrow or too broad. Each one should help users find related articles easily. I&#39;ll list out these categories ensuring they cover both the technical aspects (like algorithms) and the application areas (like recommendation systems), as well as the specific innovations and evaluations discussed in the article.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article into multiple relevant categories. Let&#39;s start by reading the title and abstract carefully.

The title is &#34;Incorporating Time in Sequential Recommendation Models.&#34; So, it&#39;s about recommendation systems that consider time in sequential data. The abstract mentions that existing models often ignore timestamps, which are crucial because many patterns depend on time. The study proposes treating time as a multi-dimensional time series using kernel-based methods and embeddings. They tested this with experiments showing improved performance.

First category is obvious: Sequential Recommendation Models since the article focuses on them. Next, Time-Aware Recommendations because they&#39;re incorporating time into the model. Multi-Dimensional Time Series is another key point from the abstract where they treat time as multi-dimensional. 

Representation Learning is mentioned as part of their method, so that&#39;s a relevant category. The paper also discusses Evaluation of recommendation systems since they tested performance improvements. Additionally, Temporal Patterns are important because the study deals with how patterns change over time.

I should check if these categories meet the guidelines: each article gets 8-12 categories, and categories should be clear and user-friendly. The ones I&#39;ve chosen seem accurate and relevant.
&lt;/think&gt;
