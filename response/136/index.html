        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: CNARe: Co-authorship Networks Analysis and Recommendations
Abstract:
We present CNARe, an easy-to-use online system that shows personalized collaboration recommendations to researchers. It also provides visualizations and metrics that allow to investigate how the recommendations affect a co-authorship network and other analyses.

Alright, so I need to categorize this research article titled &#34;CNARe: Co-uthorship Networks Analysis and Recommendations&#34; based on its abstract. The goal is to assign it to multiple relevant categories for better discoverability and user navigation. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, reading the title gives a clue that the article is about co-authorship networks and recommendations. The system CNARe provides personalized collaboration suggestions to researchers. So, I can immediately think of categories like &#34;Recommendation Systems&#34; since it&#39;s about making suggestions.

Looking at the abstract, it mentions an online system with visualizations and metrics for analyzing how recommendations affect co-authorship networks. That points towards areas like &#34;Collaborative Filtering,&#34; as recommendation systems often use this technique to suggest collaborations based on existing data.

The focus is on researchers, so &#34;Academic Collaboration&#34; seems relevant. The system&#39;s purpose is to help researchers find potential collaborators, which ties into &#34;Social Network Analysis.&#34; This analysis of networks falls under that category.

Since it&#39;s an online tool providing personalized suggestions, &#34;Personalization&#34; should be another category. The abstract also talks about visualizations and metrics, indicating that the evaluation includes more than just accuracyâ€”so &#34;Beyond Accuracy&#34; makes sense here.

Moreover, the article discusses how recommendations impact co-authorship networks, which touches on &#34;Social Networks.&#34; It&#39;s a tool designed for researchers to improve their collaboration opportunities, so &#34;Research Tools&#34; is appropriate.

Considering the domain, it&#39;s related to academic settings and helping scholars connect, so &#34;Scholarly Communication&#34; fits. The system likely handles data about users&#39; past collaborations, so &#34;User Modeling&#34; would be another category since it involves understanding user behavior to make recommendations.

Additionally, the tool helps in forming new connections or maintaining existing ones, which relates to &#34;Network Formation.&#34; It&#39;s a specialized application within recommendation systems tailored for academic collaboration, so &#34;Specialized Recommendations&#34; is suitable.

Lastly, the abstract mentions that the system allows investigation into how recommendations affect the network, indicating an interest in both current and potential future collaborations. Therefore, &#34;Future Collaboration&#34; should be included as well.

Putting it all together, I have a list of categories that cover various aspects of the article, ensuring it&#39;s discoverable under different user interests and search behaviors. Each category is chosen to align with the content&#39;s focus on recommendation systems, social networks, personalization, and academic collaboration tools.
&lt;/think&gt;
