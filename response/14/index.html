        <pre><code>You are an intelligent assistant tasked with categorizing research articles to create a user-friendly, navigable interface. Your goal is to assign each article to multiple relevant categories to ensure that users can seamlessly explore and discover content.

Key Objectives:

    1. Categorization Accuracy: Ensure each article is placed in the most appropriate categories based on its content, themes, and relevance.
    2. Category Utility: Each category should contain a sufficient number of articles to be useful for navigation. Avoid creating categories with too few articles.
    3. User-Centric Design: Prioritize categories that align with user interests and search behaviors, making the interface intuitive and efficient.
    4. Consistency: Maintain consistent categorization logic across all articles to avoid confusion and ensure a cohesive user experience.

Guidelines:

    - Multiple Categories: Assign each article to at least 8-12 categories to enhance discoverability.
    - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a balanced distribution of articles across categories to prevent overcrowding in some and underrepresentation in others.
    - Dynamic Updates: Be prepared to adjust categories as new articles are added or user needs evolve.
    - Clear Labels: Use clear, descriptive, and user-friendly category names that accurately reflect the content within.

Example Workflow:

    - Analyze the article&#39;s title and abstract to identify its core themes.
    - Map the article to existing categories or propose new ones if necessary.
    - Ensure the article is placed in categories that are both specific and broad enough to be useful.
    - Review the categorization to confirm it aligns with user needs and interface goals.

Examples of Categories:

    - Family of algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Encoder, Multi-Armed Bandits, etc.).
    - Domain of the problem (e.g., Books, Movies, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
    - Something specific in the recommendation space (e.g. Cold Start)
    - Aspects of evaluation (e.g. Diversity of Recommendations, Beyond Accuracy)
    - Whether there are any real word applications (e.g. A/B Test, User Survey, etc.)
    - Any other type of categorization that seems relevant to the article.

Output:

    - Return just the list of categories.
    - The format should be a list of keywords separated by comma, e.g. &#34;Scalability, Web Systems, Implicit Feedback&#34;


Title: Improving Sales Diversity by Recommending Users to Items
Abstract:
Sales diversity is considered a key feature of Recommender Systems from a business perspective. Sales diversity is also linked with the long-tail novelty of recommendations, a quality dimension from the user perspective. We explore the inversion of the recommendation task as a means to enhance sales diversity -and indirectly novelty -by selecting which users an item should be recommended to instead of the other way around. We address the inverted task by two approaches: a) inverting the rating matrix, and b) defining a probabilistic reformulation which isolates the popularity component of arbitrary recommendation algorithms. We find that the first approach gives rise to interesting reformulations of nearest-neighbor algorithms, which essentially introduce a new neighbor selection policy. The second approach, as well as the first, ultimately result in substantial sales diversity enhancements, and improved trade-offs with recommendation precision and novelty. Two experiments on movie and music recommendation datasets show the effectiveness of the resulting approach, even when compared to direct optimization approaches of the target metrics proposed in prior work.

        <pre><code>&lt;think&gt;
Okay, I&#39;m trying to categorize this research article about improving sales diversity by recommending users to items. Let me go through it step by step.

First, the title is &#34;Improving Sales Diversity by Recommending Users to Items.&#34; So it&#39;s about recommendation systems focusing on sales diversity. That makes me think of categories related to recommendations and business metrics.

Looking at the abstract, they mention that sales diversity is a key feature from a business perspective and linked with long-tail novelty from the user side. They inverted the recommendation task by selecting which users an item should be recommended to, instead of the usual approach. So this is about inverting the recommendation process.

They used two approaches: inverting the rating matrix and defining a probabilistic reformulation that isolates popularity components. This makes me think they&#39;re looking at different recommendation algorithms or methods. Maybe something related to nearest-neighbor algorithms since one approach reformulates those.

The experiments are on movie and music datasets, so domain-wise it&#39;s about entertainment. The results show improvements in sales diversity, precision, and novelty compared to prior work. So aspects like evaluation metrics (diversity, precision) and recommendation quality dimensions (novelty) are important.

I should consider categories that capture the methods used: Inverted Recommendation, Probabilistic Models, Nearest Neighbor Algorithms. The problem domain is Entertainment (Movies, Music). Evaluation aspects include Sales Diversity, Recommendation Precision, Long-Tail Novelty. There&#39;s also a focus on recommendation approaches like Collaborative Filtering and Personalization.

I need to ensure each category is relevant and aligns with the guidelines of being specific yet broad enough. Also, ensuring it&#39;s user-friendly, so terms like &#34;Sales Diversity&#34; and &#34;User-Centric&#34; make sense for discoverability.
&lt;/think&gt;

Inverted Recommendation, Sales Diversity, Probabilistic Models, Nearest Neighbor Algorithms, Entertainment (Movies), Entertainment (Music), Collaborative Filtering, Long-Tail Novelty, Recommendation Precision, Personalization, Cold Start, User-Centric</code></pre>
