Title: HCI for Recommender Systems: the Past, the Present and the Future
Abstract:
How can you discover something new, that matches your interest? Recommender Systems have been studied since the 90ies. Their benefit comes from guiding a user through the density of the information jungle to useful knowledge clearings. Early research on recommender systems focuses on algorithms and their evaluation to improve recommendation accuracy using F-measures and other methodologies from signal-detection theory. Present research includes other aspects such as human factors that affect the user experience and interactive visualization techniques to support transparency of results and user control. In this paper, we analyze all publications on recommender systems from the scopus database, and particularly also papers with such an HCI focus. Based on an analysis of these papers, future topics for recommender systems research are identified, which include more advanced support for user control, adaptive interfaces, affective computing and applications in high risk domains.

Okay, I need to categorize this research article about HCI for Recommender Systems into relevant categories based on the given guidelines. Let&#39;s start by understanding what the article is about.

The title mentions HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) in Recommender Systems across past, present, and future. The abstract explains that Recommender Systems have been studied since the 90s, focusing on algorithms and evaluation metrics like F-measures. Now, research includes human factors affecting user experience, interactive visualization for transparency, and user control. They analyzed papers from Scopus with an HCI focus and identified future topics such as advanced user control, adaptive interfaces, affective computing, and high-risk domain applications.

First, I&#39;ll identify the core themes. The article talks about Recommender Systems overall, so that&#39;s a primary category. It discusses past research focusing on algorithms and evaluation methods, which ties into Algorithmic Evaluation. Human factors and user experience are significant, so HCI is definitely a key category here.

The abstract mentions interactive visualization techniques for transparency and control, so Visualization Techniques should be included. User Control is another specific aspect they emphasize in both current and future work, so that&#39;s another category.

Looking at the aspects of evaluation, it mentions beyond just accuracy, so Beyond Accuracy as a category makes sense. They also discuss affective computing and high-risk domains, which are more specific application areas or future directions, so Affective Computing and High-Risk Domains should be added.

The article reviews past and future trends in research, so Research Trends is appropriate. It&#39;s based on analyzing publications from Scopus, indicating it involves a literature review, hence Literature Review as another category.

I should aim for 8-12 categories. So far, I have Recommender Systems, Algorithmic Evaluation, HCI, Visualization Techniques, User Control, Beyond Accuracy, Affective Computing, High-Risk Domains, Research Trends, and Literature Review. That&#39;s ten categories. Let me double-check if there are more aspects to cover.

The abstract also mentions the human factors affecting user experience, which ties back into HCI but maybe could be split into Human Factors? However, since HCI is already a broad category that encompasses these elements, perhaps it&#39;s covered. They discuss transparency in results through visualization, so I think Visualization Techniques captures that.

I might consider if there are other aspects like &#34;Transparency&#34; or &#34;User Experience,&#34; but the guidelines suggest using existing examples and ensuring clarity. Since HCI covers user experience broadly, adding separate categories for each aspect could lead to too many or overlapping categories. The example given didn&#39;t split it further, so I&#39;ll stick with the broader HCI category.

Is there anything else? They analyze all publications on Recommender Systems from Scopus, which is a literature review approach, so that&#39;s covered under Literature Review. Future topics include adaptive interfaces, but that&#39;s more about future directions rather than a specific current category, so maybe not necessary to list as a separate one unless it fits another category.

I think the ten categories I&#39;ve identified cover all the main points without being too granular. They provide a good balance between broad and specific categories for discoverability.
&lt;/think&gt;

Okay, so I need to categorize this article titled &#34;HCI for Recommender Systems: the Past, the Present and the Future.&#34; The abstract talks about how recommender systems have evolved since the 90s, focusing on algorithms and evaluation methods initially. Now, present research includes human factors affecting user experience and interactive visualization techniques for transparency and control. They analyzed all publications on recommender systems from Scopus, especially those with an HCI focus, and identified future topics like advanced user control, adaptive interfaces, affective computing, and applications in high-risk domains.

Let me start by breaking down the key points. The article discusses the historical development of recommender systems, so &#34;Historical Development&#34; seems relevant. It mentions algorithms, which would fall under &#34;Recommender Algorithms.&#34; Evaluation methods like F-measures from signal-detection theory point to &#34;Evaluation Metrics.&#34;

The paper shifts focus to HCI aspects, so that&#39;s definitely a primary category—&#34;Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).&#34; They talk about interactive visualization for transparency and user control, which are specific HCI techniques, so I&#39;ll include &#34;Interactive Visualization&#34; and &#34;User Control &amp; Transparency.&#34;

Since they analyzed publications from Scopus, this suggests a literature review approach. So adding &#34;Literature Review&#34; makes sense. The paper also emphasizes future research directions in HCI for recommender systems, hence &#34;Future Directions.&#34;

They mention adaptive interfaces, which relates to personalization and dynamic user experience, so I&#39;ll add &#34;Adaptive Interfaces.&#34; Affective computing is another key area they highlight, which involves emotional aspects of interaction, so that&#39;s a must—&#34;Affective Computing.&#34;

Lastly, the article touches on high-risk domains as applications for recommender systems. This indicates a focus on specific or niche application areas beyond general use, so I&#39;ll include &#34;High-Risk Domains&#34; and &#34;Application Areas.&#34;

Wait, should I also consider if there are more categories? Maybe something like &#34;HCI in Recommender Systems&#34; but that&#39;s too broad since HCI is already a category. The paper doesn&#39;t mention scalability directly, but it does talk about user control and interfaces, so maybe not necessary.

I think that covers the main points without overcomplicating it. Each category should be relevant and clear to help users navigate effectively.
